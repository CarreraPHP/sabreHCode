(13, 'Breakfast with a stranger', 'CHAPTER ONE', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="A" src="A.gif">lyse woke in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets knotted about her legs. She groaned, hiding her face beneath her pillow, trying to ignore the call of the day. The rustling of the trees outside seemed a lingering leftover of the disturbing dreams and murmuring voices of the night. She rose quietly and padded over to the window. The forest lay thick and impenetrable in the darkness. She shivered. In the glass, her reflection shivered back at her. Prodding gently at the dark circles below her eyes, she tried to remember how long it had been since she had slept properly.<p></p>\r\n<p>''Two weeks and three days,'' she reminded herself. That had been when the dreams had begun. If only she could remember them as easily, then perhaps she would not dread the coming of the night and lie, counting the cracks in the ceiling and listing the next day’s chores, rather than succumb to the frightening arms of sleep. Pulling her blonde hair back into a bun at her nape, she washed and dressed quietly, then closed the shutters so that the rising sun did not disturb her brother still sleeping soundly on the opposite bed. She gazed lovingly at Jarok’s curled figure, one hand under the pillow, the other wrapped tightly, as always, about the pouch in which he kept his numerous ''treasures''. Tenderly brushing his black hair back from sleep-flushed cheeks, she kissed his temple before pulling the blankets back up about his chin and tiptoed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p>In the main room she opened the door and shutters to the morning sun, then turned to the basket for kindling to light the stove and prepare breakfast. It was empty. As usual, Jarok had forgotten to fill it before he went to bed. She really was going to have to be a bit stricter with the boy she told herself, not for the first time, as she went to the woodpile around the side of the cottage. Suddenly, a black mass hurled itself upon her. She cried out in surprise, hugging it to her body. </p>\r\n<p>"Royle! I swear...&nbsp;one of these days!" She glared at the cat in exasperation. </p>\r\n<p>“Honestly, I don''t know why I put up with you. If it wasn''t for Jarok... ”</p>\r\n<p>Unperturbed by the oft-heard words, Royle rubbed his head along her neck and purred gently in her ear. Tweaking one of his own in response, she dropped him gently to the ground. Picking up as much wood as she could carry, she went back to the kitchen while Royle wandered off into the bedroom to wake up Jarok. By the time Alyse had breakfast on the table he was dressed and sitting in his place, the cat, like his ever-present pouch, curled up on his lap.</p>\r\n<p>"Morning Alyse!" Jarok’ smile broadened into a wide yawn. He placed his hand over it quickly with a murmur of apology.</p>\r\n<p>"Eat now, before it goes cold."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok picked up his spoon, then put it straight back down again.</p>\r\n<p>"Guess what I found yesterday? My best ever yet! It''s too beautiful to be hidden away, so I want to you to have it as an early birthday present." His head deep inside his pouch of valuables, Jarok paused in his search when Alyse tapped his bowl with her spoon. Looking up and seeing the well-known raised eyebrow, he quickly stuffed a spoonful of porridge into his mouth before resuming his search.</p>\r\n<p>"One of these days, you''ll fall in there and be lost forever!" She laughed, watching in fascination the variety of expressions that sped across his features. When they arrived at a look of triumph, she knew he had found whatever he was looking for.</p>\r\n<p>"Close your eyes first," he insisted. "And no peeking!" Alyse did as she was bid but instead of the expected ''look now’ she heard a loud spitting hiss. Her eyes flew open to see Royle scoot from Jarok’s lap and straight across the table, scattering everything in his path. Jumping up quickly to avoid wearing the descending porridge, she shook her fist at the fleeing cat. Jarok studiously avoided looking at the furious Alyse as he began trying to clean up the mess, praying that Royle would have the sense to steer clear until she had calmed down. Maybe in a day or two! If only he could do the same. Then all thoughts of mess, blame and retribution were drowned by the sounds of mayhem outside. Alyse threw up her hands and rushed outside where a dusty, slightly dishevelled man was gripping the offending cat by the scruff.</p>\r\n<p>"Does this belong to you?" He asked, offering them a look of apology for the manner in which he held it, when they nodded their assent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>"His name''s Royle. On account of his royal bearing," said Jarok holding out his arms to the cat.</p>\r\n<p>"On account of his being a royal pain in the neck," muttered Alyse, flicking a half glance back towards the mess waiting in the kitchen. </p>\r\n<p>"My apologies, Sir Royle. Had I realised your standing I should have been more respectful of your person. Cymon, is my name. At your service." He flourished a bow to the glowering cat, and then turned to the two children watching him with quite different expressions. The boy was grinning delightedly. The girl, he feared, thought him quite mad. "And at your service also mistress... young master. My apologies again, for appearing in such a fashion and for the mishandling of a member of your family."</p>\r\n<p>"Feel free anytime," breathed Alyse, shooting the cat a glance that said it was lucky it wasn''t her hands around his neck.</p>\r\n<p>"I just stepped into the clearing," the stranger continued as though he hadn''t heard her mumbled comment: when Sir Royle launched his attack on my poor horse intent, I believe, on tearing him to pieces. I had to restrain the cat in such a manner in order to protect the both of us.’</p>\r\n<p>The horse snorted and kicked out a back leg and while the adversaries in question eyed each other. The man went on to introduce himself properly.</p>\r\n<p>"My name, as I said, is Cymon. I''m a traveller from across the Great Plain. My home is called Phelise. Perhaps you''ve heard of it," he asked, almost hopefully. Alyse said she had not, and asked him what it was he was doing here.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah, yes! I said I''m a traveller...&nbsp;more of a runaway really." He saw the look of concern that filled her face as she pulled the boy close to her side. "Nothing like that," he laughed, shaking his head. "My mother was trying to marry me off but I’m not ready to settle down just yet and so I left home in rather a hurry. Anyway, yesterday my horse developed a painful limp that has been growing steadily worse. Down in the village they said you had a way with animals and might be able to help. I''ll pay you, of course, for your trouble," he added quickly. As though on cue, the horse lifted it’s right foreleg off the ground, holding it in a manner that suggested great discomfort. Her concern for the poor animal’s suffering aroused, Alyse moved over to it and gently ran both hands down the affected area.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t feel anything amiss. Perhaps it''s just a strain and he will walk it off."</p>\r\n<p>The horse took two exaggerated limps forward, hanging its head almost to the ground. Alyse’s face filled with pity as the horse whinnied distressfully.</p>\r\n<p>"Then again," she mused, "a good rest may be the better course of action. Especially, if he has been over-ridden. Tired muscles can be very painful." She glared accusingly at Cymon’s guilty flush. With a pronounced sigh for the thoughtlessness of men, she pressed her hands to her cheeks and brushed her little fingers across her lips. It would be unfair, if not cruel, to ask the horse to walk back to the village stables.</p>\r\n<p>"He can rest in the barn." She strode off determinedly towards the barn before she could change her mind. "I have grain and hay. We''ll see how he is in the morning."</p>\r\n<p>Reaching the barn before them, she raised her hand to shield her eyes from the sun as she watched them approach. Just for a moment, she got the impression of a tall, lithe figure, feet barely touching the ground as he walked, dark green jerkin over a brown shirt, with a wide- ribbed belt, brown trousers tucked into short boots, arching eyebrows above dancing, brown eyes and pale blonde hair which reached down to cover pointed ears. A slender hand was draped across the neck of his horse, whose white coat gleamed silver in the sunlight. Then they were beside her in the shadow of the barn. The short, stocky young man with mousy-brown hair tied back with a strip of leather and the dusty, sorry-looking chestnut. She blinked away her fancies, chiding herself that she was getting as bad as Jarok, led the horse into the stall and went to fetch a nose-bag of grain while Cymon gave him a quick rub down with a handful of straw. She fit the nosebag over the horse’s head and two of them left him there, munching happily.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon looked around as they walked the thirty or so paces back to the cottage, whose thatching, though still sound Alyse assured him, had certainly seen better days. A number of planks in the barn were rotted and broken and one of the shutters on the cottage window hung at an odd angle. Yet despite this, which he thought gave the old place charm and character, the area was clean and tidy. Everything was either stacked neatly against the cottage wall or, as he had already observed, hanging in their precise spots on nails inside the barn. At the rear, the forest hugged the cottage close, threatening to engulf it, but out front was kept at bay by a border of dense shrub preserving the lush green clearing across which walked. He noticed too, that the cat had made itself scarce. No doubt acting upon advice from the boy whose face was a picture of assumed innocence, too perfect to be real.</p>\r\n<p>"My name''s Alyse by the way," she finally informed him. "This is my brother, Jarok." She tugged the boy’s hair playfully, as they walked past him. "Have you had breakfast," she half asked, half offered.</p>\r\n<p>"I did... yesterday," he gave a rueful grin.</p>\r\n<p>"As you can see," she said, as they entered the kitchen, "we were also quite forcefully informed of your arrival." A distinct note of irritation heightened her voice and Cymon thought the cat did well to keep a low profile as she took it out on the innocent dishes. "Sit. It won''t take me long to get this cleaned up." True to her word, the mess was quickly cleared away and three, steaming hot bowls of porridge placed on the table. Nobody spoke as they emptied their bowls, Cymon doing so somewhat self-consciously under their constant gazes.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s it like...&nbsp;travelling," asked Jarok, as soon as Cymon had put his spoon down. "You must have loads to tell."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon watched the dreamy expression already beginning to fall over the boy’s face and saw his first chance to create a place for himself in their group.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah! The lure of the open road! The thrill of freedom stirring the blood! What can compare to the sun on your back and the grass under your feet? Never are two days the same. Different people... different places... Exciting towns and cities full of hustle and bustle from dawn to dusk... Enticing ruins that lure with the memories of past ages and long-forgotten heroes, whose shades still wander their stones re-enacting their glorious deeds. Mighty waterfalls that fill raging rivers, dry, dusty deserts with their vibrant green oasis, mountains, too high to climb, separated by lush, fertile valleys, wildlife and birds of every description to delight the eye and trap the unwary. And you know what''s best of all?" Jarok shook his head, mouth agape and black eyes bulging.</p>\r\n<p>"There''s nobody but yourself to tell you what to do!" The words were barely out when he felt the sting of boiling water on the back of his hand as Alyse slammed his mug upon the table. He looked up into stern, un-amused eyes that drew his attention to Jarok, who sat transfixed in a world of his own, caught up in the romance, not the reality. Alyse raised an eyebrow in an unspoken question as to what he was going to do about it. Cymon took a deep breath and broke Jarok’s daydream.</p>\r\n<p>"Actually," he admitted in a matter-of-fact tone, "it''s cold, tiring and very, very lonely."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok came crashing down to earth with a bump, disappointment replacing the wonder on his face. Alyse wore a broad smile of satisfaction as she sipped her tea. As she took the dirty dishes to the sink, Cymon leaned across and tapped Jarok gently on the hand to get his attention.</p>\r\n<p>"But it''s fun," he mouthed to him. The giggle that escaped the boy had them both looking guiltily over at Alyse, in case she had noticed their exchange. When she showed no sign of having done so, Jarok wiped a hand across his forehead in a playful gesture of having escaped a fate worse than death. Cymon joined in with a silent whistle. Alyse smiled to herself. Any doubts she had about allowing Cymon to stay were abated by this instant friendship and rapport that had sprung up between him and her brother. Jarok had an uncanny knack of sensing the inner self of a person and she trusted his judgement. Cymon’s voice broke through her thoughts, asking if there was anything he could do to repay her hospitality.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, for a start, you could fill the water butt," she told him. "Jarok will show you where."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok shot Cymon a sympathetic smile that told him quite clearly he would indeed pay for his board. Cymon gave him a resigned shrug in return.</p>\r\n<p>"The sooner we get started, the sooner we''ll be finished," he said, shooing Jarok through the door ahead of him. Alyse watched them go deciding she liked this Cymon more and more, though she had no illusions that the water butt would actually get filled any time soon. She had not missed the quick wink he had given Jarok and if she knew her brother, he would bombard Cymon with a hundred and one questions the moment he thought they were out of her earshot. Watching them cross the clearing, Cymon swinging a bucket in each hand while Jarok danced along beside him, her spirits rose. She had not seen her brother this happy for a long time. It would do him good to have some cheerful company. She did her best to fill his life, but she had not been feeling quite herself for a while, and even before the dreams began, he had been left pretty much to his own amusement. Alyse gave them until mid-day before following them down to the stream. Cymon’s soft tones drifted towards her before they came into view, recanting tales of daring. She stopped to listen, finding the gentle, musical lilt oddly soothing. </p>\r\n<p>"... So there he was," she heard him say, "sweating and bleeding from the many bites and claw wounds he had sustained. </p>\r\n<p>A young colt, barely bigger than they, bucking and kicking for all he was worth. Even though his strength was beginning to fail, he wouldn''t give up. Snapping the muzzle of any that ventured within range, eyes rolling white as he screamed his defiance of them. They''d have to go through him to get to his dam! Even from the distance he was a fearsome sight and those wolves must have thought so too, for they could''ve easily brought him down otherwise. His dam was already gone by the time I arrived and I feared he would soon join her, for he was in a bad way and had lost a lot of blood. But he did pull through and I named him Defiant, after his nature. He seemed to like it... and me, for he''s never left my side since."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse, who had been occupied trying to match this description with the sorry-looking nag in her barn, jumped when Cymon’s amused tone invited her to join them. Completely embarrassed at having been caught eavesdropping, Alyse would have preferred to turn and run but she knew that would only amuse him still further. Jarok also jumped up guiltily at the mention of her name, but was saved an impromptu ducking by the swift hand that shot out to grab his belt. He turned around as Alyse stepped into view and was frozen by the full force of her frowning displeasure that proceeded to drop pointedly to the empty buckets. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry Alyse, truly I am," Jarok rushed to accept the blame as he bent and hastily replaced his absent socks and boots. "It wasn''t Cymon’s fault. We just sat for a moment to catch our breath and I asked him to tell me a story. And they are so... interesting, I sort of just forgot the buckets." </p>\r\n<p>Alyse turned to Cymon, who shrugged his shoulders and raised his hands in front of him in surrender. Under her continuing glower, he pulled his feet from the water, picked up the upturned buckets, which they had been sitting on, filled both and handed one to the boy.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok,” Alyse called after him as he trudged off disconsolately, his head bowed into his chest.&nbsp;"Take that one straight into the kitchen, will you dear?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok beamed in relief that she was no longer angry with him. The spring returned to his step and the bucket seem less heavy. Cymon quickly pulled on his boots and hurried after Alyse, swinging the bucket into his left hand so that it would not catch her leg.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re very patient with him." </p>\r\n<p>"I wasn''t really angry with him in the first place," she admitted.</p>\r\n<p>"I never thought you were," answered Cymon. Alyse shot him a quick glance, aware of the hidden reference to her embarrassment in the remark. Then gave a wry smile. "I indulge him, yes," she directed her reply to his first statement. "It''s not an easy life for him, living as secluded as we do. Perhaps that''s the reason for his strangeness. You know, sometimes as I watch him, I wonder if he really belongs here at all!" She paused for a moment then gave a soft laugh. "Certainly his mind is elsewhere for a lot of the time. Besides, we only have each other and to remain angry with him, would only make us both unhappy." She stared after her brother with a look of intense love. "Don''t get me wrong," she went on after a while. "I don''t spoil him. Well, I try not to," she conceded to Cymon’s look of total disbelief. "Anyway, I''m his sister, but what of you? You show considerable patience for someone you hardly know," she pointed out.</p>\r\n<p>"I think," he replied thoughtfully, "that it would be impossible to remain a stranger to Jarok for long plus he''s a good listener and as you''ve already discovered, I do so love to talk. There''s been little chance for it on the road. I found it safer to avoid the busy inns and taverns, where I might enjoy some company. Many a rogue lies in wait in such places, sizing up his next victim. So, apart from Defiant, I''ve only had myself to talk to. It''s been a pleasure to have such a responsive audience."</p>\r\n<p>By now, they had reached the cottage and Cymon emptied his bucket into the water butt.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse placed her hand on his arm as he made to replace the bucket where he had found it.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t mean to be rude," she said hesitantly, "but have you been on the road a long time? And the majority of that time has been spent outdoors," she continued when Cymon nodded, "away from the amenities offered by these inns and such like...?" </p>\r\n<p>"That''s right," he agreed. "The last time I stayed at an inn was...&nbsp;oh, ten... maybe twelve days ago." Cymon suddenly threw back his head and roared with laughter, so loudly that Jarok appeared to find out what was so funny.</p>\r\n<p>"Your sister... " Cymon’s laughter increased as Alyse’s face turned bright red, "has just delicately informed me that I am in sore need of a bath!"</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse!" Jarok gasped, staring at his sister in amazement before joining in Cymon’s merriment.</p>\r\n<p>"Well he is,” said Alyse defensively, resisting the urge to stamp her foot, they were already having far too much fun at her expense. Their laughter continued to assault her ears as they took the tin bath down off the wall and carried it around the side of the cottage for privacy. As she prepared supper she was serenaded by the sound of singing and splashing water. She could not catch the words but she had the sneaking suspicion that she was the topic of their song. At least they both had the grace to look shamefaced as they seated themselves for supper. She quite enjoyed herself making them squirm guiltily beneath her icy glare but she couldn''t keep it up for long and soon they were all joining in the fun of the day over a thick, tasty vegetable stew followed by hot apple pie. Both Cymon and Jarok ate heartily but Alyse merely picked at her meal, blaming the unusual day for her lack of appetite. Cymon said nothing, though he did not miss the troubled frown that crossed Jarok’s face before he lowered his head to his plate. As Alyse listened to the warm banter going back and forth across the table, she marvelled at how easily and effortlessly Cymon had slipped in. It was almost as if he were already one of the family, one who had simply been away for a while. Her eyes followed his movements as, having sated his hunger. He leant back in his chair and rubbed his hands over his stomach with a sigh of pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>"That was an excellent meal," he said. "Thank you."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re welcome," replied Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>Watching him, sitting there in her father’s old clothes, telling jokes and making faces with Jarok, Alyse was swept away by memories of happier times when her parents were still alive. Of it’s own volition, her tongue spoke the words that extended the offer of a bed for the night, to one of a few days. Jarok grinned so widely that she thought his face would split as Cymon, gratefully and with pleasure, accepted her offer. She alone appeared to be surprised by her words.</p>\r\n<p>The few days drifted into weeks as Cymon became firmly entrenched into the family unit. A mixture of big brother and favourite uncle, he replaced the broken planks in the barn and repaired the thatching on the cottage roof. No mention was made now as to his leaving, instead Alyse talked of building a lean-to on the side of the cottage so he would be more comfortable, especially now the nights were drawing in and there was a coolness in the air. There were times when Alyse caught certain wistfulness in his eyes, and thought he had something more he wanted to say. Then he would seem to change his mind and disappear to do some task that needed finishing. But not wishing to spoil this newfound sense of contentment and security, she did not press him.</p>\r\n<p>During these weeks, Cymon learnt that their mother had died the night Jarok was born, and their father had immediately moved them to this place, which he had found abandoned by it’s previous owners. Then he too had died, less than two years later, leaving Alyse to raise her brother alone for the last six years. She had been forced to grow up quickly, leaving most of her childhood behind at her mother’s bedside and severing its final ties with her father’s passing. Despite enormous pressure from the local villagers, she had refused to be separated from Jarok and the two of them had survived against the odds. Her hard life had given Alyse a strong will, with its fair share of stubbornness, and had produced in her a maturity that is rarely found in a young girl of sixteen years. A woman’s eyes looked out of the child’s face and the palms of her slender hands were calloused by years of hard work. Though uneducated, she possessed great intelligence and a wide knowledge of plant and herb, both for food and medicinal purposes, attained solely &mdash; Cymon discovered to his horror &mdash; by an often-dangerous practice of trial and error. Jarok was her life and her joy, as she was his. That Alyse doted on the boy was plain to see from the first. His happiness and well being, was the core around which the rest of her life was planned. It was impossible not to be affected by the deep love that surrounded them and it was not long before Cymon was drawn in also, and his reasons for being there became faded by his desire to be there and soon he had almost forgotten them completely.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok became his faithful shadow and followed him everywhere. It took little pestering for Cymon to be persuaded to teach him to swim in the shallow pool not far downstream from where they had filled the buckets. He also taught him how to play the little flute that he carried and when the boy appeared one afternoon with just the right-sized piece of wood, it seemed quite natural that Cymon should leave what he was doing and make Jarok a whistle of his own. In fact, Cymon was learning increasing day by day, that he could not say ''No'' to Jarok at all. Even Defiant was not immune to Jarok’s unexplainable charisma, as Cymon was to discover the day he came out of the barn to find the horse walking about the clearing with Jarok upon his back. Cymon stood in amazement, for Defiant had never allowed anyone to ride him but himself.</p>\r\n<p>"Look Cymon, no hands,” Jarok squealed excitedly as he spotted Cymon there and lifted his arms in the air. Cymon was only grateful that Alyse had decided to make a rare visit to the village. He called Defiant to stop and lifted Jarok down, reminding him that he had not asked his permission or, more importantly, Alyse’s to ride Defiant. Jarok sobered up quickly at the mention of his sisters'' name. Alyse however, proved to have no objections provided stayed close to supervise. She also insisted that Jarok undertook all the more mundane things to do with caring for Defiant, so that he would understand there was more to it than just riding and having fun. While Cymon applauded her sense, Jarok listened to the growing list of ''things to do'' and wondered if it was really going to be worth all the trouble. He discovered it was, getting as much pleasure from caring for the horse as he did from riding him...&nbsp;well almost!</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes Cymon and Jarok would ride double and go off into the forest, where Cymon taught the eager youngster how to track, how to walk softly and stealthily over the forest litter, and how to double back, all in the guise of playing ''hide and seek''. But best of all, to Jarok’s mind, were the stories. For long hours they would sit on an old tree trunk or lay on their backs watching the sun filtering through the treetops while Cymon would tell of glorious battles and gruesome monsters in faraway places. They would often arrive back at the cottage to get their ears chewed by Alyse, furious that they were late for supper again, but she never stayed angry for long and supper would appear piping hot, from the oven, despite her threats to let them starve! It became something of a ritual. They would kiss her on the cheek and say ''Thank you'', as sweetly as they knew how. Then all three of them would laugh together and sit to eat.</p>\r\n<p>The deeper Cymon became enmeshed in their lives and the more he got to really know them, the more he marvelled that two children of the same parentage, who had grown up with no outside influences, could be as different as chalk and cheese as these two: One mature and responsible, the other totally innocent and full of dreams &mdash; blonde Alyse with delicate, cornflower-blue eyes and Jarok with hair and eyes as black as the rich soil of Phelise. Cymon often wondered if their parents were as unalike as these two but on the occasions he had ventured to talk about them, Alyse had become vague and reticent. It obviously still pained her deeply. Jarok of course, had been too young at the time of their deaths to remember anything. </p>\r\n<p>As his affection deepened, he began to worry about them much more than his position warranted, especially so about Alyse. She had not regained the appetite that had eluded her on the day of his arrival and the dark smudges under her eyes were now black hollows. Jarok had told him that Alyse was not sleeping properly and woke early each morning, long before dawn. He had caught her rubbing her temples many times, as if she had a headache, but she always denied it. Cymon had also noticed these symptoms, had often seen Alyse in the darkness, standing in the open doorway and staring up at the night sky when she thought everyone else abed. Still he kept silent, thinking it was not his place to intrude. But then yesterday Jarok told him he had followed Alyse, not to spy he insisted, only to practise his tracking skills. As soon as she was far enough away from the cottage she lay down and started crying. Cymon knew he could no longer stand idly by and watch them hurting each other, for indeed they were. One desperately trying to hide the fact there was something wrong; the other desperately trying to hide the fact he noticed. He would talk to Alyse after Jarok had gone to bed this evening, he decided.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse had also decided it was time to clear the air. It had not passed her by that, while they had told him all about themselves, Cymon had not reciprocated. Though she trusted him, she had to face the fact that they knew no more about him other than he had revealed that first day and those wistful moments she had witnessed kept coming back to haunt her. She had put off having this talk, dreading that the outcome may result in his moving on. She would miss him for himself, for she had grown very fond of him. She would miss his conversation, his sense of humour, the way he had with Jarok. She paused in her thoughts. She would she admitted honestly, miss most of all, the feeling of security she had knowing he was around, especially after what she had been hearing in the village disturbing rumours about slaughtered livestock and mysterious disappearances which, should they be believed, were heading in their direction. Add these to the recurring nightmares and the once friendly forest had taken on a menacing quality, especially after nightfall. The once soothing noises of the night now held an eerie, threatening tone that frightened her. She had not felt such fear since the morning she had woken to find her father was no longer there to guide her. She was so scared that Cymon would leave. She did not know what they would do if he did, even though a voice in her head reminded her they had managed all these years before he came. She did know, that alone, she would not be able to protect her brother if these rumours proved true. Her commonsense told her to leave well enough alone and just be thankful for Cymon’s presence. She had tried, but that other voice kept insisting that he was hiding something. It battled with her trust and affection and it won. </p>\r\n<p>She found Cymon weeding the vegetable patch and called his name as she approached, miming the action of sipping tea when he looked up. He put down the hoe, wiping his hands down his trousers as he carefully stepped over the rows of vegetables to join her in the kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>"I needed that," he said gratefully, after swallowing a long mouthful from the mug awaiting him on the table. </p>\r\n<p>"You must have read my mind!" His laughter died when she did not respond and then he noticed the seriousness of her expression as she toyed with the handle of her mug. "Why so serious?" His heart suddenly skipped a beat. "Has something happened to Jarok? Has he had an accident? Is he hurt?" He leapt from his chair and strode towards the bedroom. " Where is he?" he finished in alarm, finding it empty.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok is fine. He''s out treasure hunting," she told him.</p>\r\n<p>"Is it you then? Are you sick?" He dropped to his knees beside her, feeling her brow.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon, sit down,” she ordered irritably, slapping his hand away. "While your obvious concern is most comforting I would rather you calm yourself. You sound worse than Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>There''s nothing wrong with either of us. My worry Cymon... is you."</p>\r\n<p>"Me?" Incredulity raised his voice at least an octave.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. You." she affirmed, taking a deep breath. "What are you doing here, Cymon? Why did you come?"</p>\r\n<p>"You know why! Defiant had hurt his leg and you... "</p>\r\n<p>"Please,” she cut him off, eyes flashing angrily as she banged her mug on the table. "Don''t insult my intelligence a second time. I may not know as much as you but I''m not stupid! I must admit I was completely taken in at the beginning. Amongst his other talents, Defiant is an accomplished actor. So good in fact, that it took me a full week to realise he was faking. He tended to forget which leg he was supposed to be limping on,” she grinned fondly at the memory as she gazed out of the window to where Defiant stood. His head turned in her direction as though he were aware they were talking about him. She wiggled her fingers to say hello and he returned to his grazing while she turned back to Cymon. She placed her elbows on the table, rested her chin on closed fists and stared at him long and hard without a word. Cymon waited with growing apprehension.</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you, Cymon? Really? Don''t we deserve the truth," she finally asked the inevitable question.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was cornered, and he knew it. Trapped between a rock and a hard place, as reason at last caught up with desire and reality reared its ugly head into the fantasy world he had created. He pushed his fingers through his hair, scratching his suddenly itching scalp beneath which his frantic mind was trying to decide what to do. His orders were to tell them nothing but the Elders had not counted on her astuteness. His orders had also been to get her and leave and he had taken scant notice of those, his guilty self reminded him. A loud sigh escaped him. He wished he could escape her intense gaze as easily. She was right though, he told himself firmly. She deserved the truth.&nbsp;''Hang the Elders!'' he though rebelliously. He had too much respect for her to attempt to lie to her again, whatever they said. He had never really been happy with the deceit, indeed from the first he had tried to avoid it by mentioning Phelise. He fixed her gaze with his own, so that she would recognise his honesty.</p>\r\n<p>"I haven''t so much lied to you Alyse, more withheld the entire truth. My name is Cymon. I am a traveller. What I neglected to reveal was that I was travelling specifically to be with you. As to who am I, perhaps ''what'' would be a better word." </p>\r\n<p>A strange circular hand movement accompanied low words she didn''t understand, revealing clearly her sunlit vision of that first day. </p>\r\n<p>"I am Elfin," he continued, his transformation complete. "We are Masters of Illusion. This disguise wasn''t entirely to deceive you however," he assured her. "The Elders thought it would be less disturbing for you if I appeared as one of your own race. Also, we Elfin have learnt to our cost during the centuries, that it''s safer not to advertise our presence in the outside world. It''s also true that my home is called Phelise. I disobeyed orders telling you that, hoping you would recognise it so that I could reveal the truth to you, about both my mission and myself. When you didn''t, I realised I''d have to bide my time and first earn your trust. I couldn''t just walk in and force you to follow me...&nbsp;No matter what the orders," he finished silently.</p>\r\n<p>"Phelise." The name seemed to roll across Alyse’s tongue like a caress, filling her with a strange longing she didn''t understand. "The Home of the Firstborn!" </p>\r\n<p>Cymon started with surprise, it was not a commonly known title of Phelise amongst the other races. He stared at her thoughtfully and sure she was unaware of the soft, mournful words that fell from her lips and equally so of the wistful yearning in her voice. This was confirmed when she asked where Phelise was.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s here, there, everywhere. My home occupies the same space as your world but it exists in the half time that lies between the heartbeats of your existence. You can only get there through one of four gateways that join our two worlds. So... that is who and what I am. As to my mission: the Elders have, for many centuries, kept a watchful eye on a wizard named Duman. Does this mean anything to you?"</p>\r\n<p>"No, nothing at all," she shrugged.</p>\r\n<p>"No matter. Recently it became known that Duman was sending &mdash; shall we say ''servants''&mdash; further abroad than ever before. Somehow the Elders discovered that you were their target and called the young men together and asked for a volunteer to bring you home. And so, here I am," he finished, spreading his arms wide.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse lifted her mug, sipping slowly to digest all she had just heard. It seemed too incredible! Yet there he sat. His talk of a wizard and his servants gaining substance alongside his undeniable Elfin form, the village rumours and her ever-increasing unease.</p>\r\n<p>"But why?" The muffled question finally coming from behind the mug she still held to her lips, in a kind of defence gesture.</p>\r\n<p>"That part was also true. I really was avoiding my Mother’s ma... "</p>\r\n<p>"Not that,” she snapped impatiently, her face re-appearing fully for a moment. "I mean, why does this ''Duman'' or whatever his name is, want me?"</p>\r\n<p>"That, I don''t know. The Elders are very vague at times." He held his hand over his heart. "That''s all I know. I swear."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse searched his face for any trace that he was being less than totally honest. She found none. Slowly placing her mug down on the table, she rested her tired head beside it. She was hurt, confused and very angry. She was angry with Cymon for his deceit. Angry at these ''Elders'' for forcing him to be so and for sending him to become a part of their lives that would one day be taken away; just like their parents. She was more than angry with the unknown wizard who obviously sought to harm her... why else would she need protection? Who were these people that thought they had the right to interfere willy-nilly in her life without her consent? Most of all she was angry with herself, for this wretched feeling of helplessness that swamped her. A feeling so alien to her nature that she despised herself for it. Cymon saw the slump in her body and felt deeply her sense of defeat. Though he wanted to, he knew he could not comfort her. She had to work this through for herself. Still, it was hard to sit, watching her suffering and do nothing. He was at the point of giving in when, to his relief, she suddenly drew herself erect, her face as stubbornly determined as he had ever seen it, eyes clear and steady and mouth set. He smiled inwardly. She was a survivor!</p>\r\n<p>"So, where do we go from here," he asked, picking up his mug and leaning back in his chair.</p>\r\n<p>"Until I''ve had time to think this through properly, nowhere &mdash; Jarok and me, anyway. You are free to do as you please of course." Her eyes clouded. She had offered him a way out and now feared he would take it. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m not in any hurry," he sent her a soft smile to allay the fears written on her face. "What about Jarok," he asked. "Shall I tell him or shall you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Time enough to tell him when it becomes necessary."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon nodded and the air around him wavered once more as he re-cloaked himself. </p>\r\n<p>The last barrier between them lifted, they finished their tea in companionable silence and the remainder of the day passed by uneventfully. Cymon finished the weeding, then set about stuffing some new mattresses from the last of the straw. Alyse, feeling better than she had for some time, went to pick mushrooms for supper. Perhaps she would find some of those large, split ones that Cymon liked so much. Jarok came back from his treasure hunting and retreated into the bedroom for a private inspection of his new acquisitions. He came out again full of excitement, waving his pouch at Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"I found it again,” he exclaimed. "I forgot all about it in all the excitement when Cymon turned up. You never did get to see it."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse had no idea what he was talking about but she smiled indulgently.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, I''m sure that whatever it is, I''ll appreciate it all the more for waiting. I''ll look forward to seeing it after supper."</p>\r\n<p>"But Alyse, I wanted to show you now,” he persisted.</p>\r\n<p>"Now," said Alyse firmly, "supper is ready. Run along and fetch Cymon before it gets cold, there''s a dear. After supper you can show us both at the same time and it will be doubly enjoyable."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok fidgeted all through supper, impatient for it to be over so that he could reveal his treasure. He planned it out as he ate. He would make them try to guess first. Three each maybe, though he knew they would never succeed. Then he would say they had to close their eyes and he would make them wait for simply ages. His free hand strayed often during the meal, to the pouch that sat prominently on the table. Eventually supper was over but things did not go as he planned. </p>\r\n<p>"I''ve a special story for you tonight Jarok," said Cymon, just as Jarok was undoing the strings of his pouch. " It'' called... ''The Ballad of Duman''."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s head came up sharply. Her eyes wide in surprise, glared accusingly at Cymon whose own told her ''not to worry'' in return. Jarok noticed neither reaction, the excitement of hearing a brand new story chased everything else from his mind.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman," he queried. "Who''s Duman? Is he good or bad?" He flung the questions into the air as he left the table, absent-mindedly slinging his pouch into its usual position across his chest.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah! Duman,” replied Cymon theatrically, as he made his way more slowly to his after-supper seat beside the fire. Jarok sat down at his feet with Royle on his lap, tail twitching under his nose until he managed to grab it and hold it still.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse took out the box of mending, settling herself at the table with a calmness she was far from feeling. She was annoyed by Cymon’s choice of story because she thought they had agreed earlier, not to mention anything to Jarok. She was also apprehensive as to its contents for her own sake, though she did not know why. Cymon’s eyes told her to trust him and she really had no choice but to do so. If she tried to stop him from telling it, Jarok would know immediately that there was more to it than just a tale and that would make him even more determined to hear it. So she sat quietly sewing as if nothing was amiss. Irritated at being so neatly out-manoeuvred, she carelessly stabbed her finger with the needle. </p>\r\n<p>''Serve you right," she chided herself silently with a glare at Cymon as she stuck the bleeding finger in her mouth. ''On both counts!''</p>\r\n<p>"A sad and tragic tale it certainly is," Cymon began, "but I''ll leave you to decide for yourself whether Duman was good or bad. Or perhaps he was simply a mere pawn in the hands of others, more devious and evil than he knew." He took a deep breath and let it out on a long sigh. </p>\r\n<p>"An Elf by Race was Duman. Once a noble and mighty warrior, loved and revered by all men of all races, at a time when Elfin kind walked openly and freely in this world, now, a wizard: powerful in the arts of dark magic. He abides in an impenetrable fortress carved from the mountain itself, whose sides have not known the tread of human feet for thousands of years and is guarded by gargoyles and demons summoned from the very depths of Darkness itself. A great, dark cloud hovers over it like a tarnished crown, shrouding everything in permanent darkness and a lethal mist seeps from the rock to destroy any who would be fool enough to venture there." </p>\r\n<p>He paused to gauge the effect the story was having on his audience. Alyse seemed intent on her sewing but Jarok’s intensively sensitive and responsive imagination already had him lost in time and place, away in a mystical land of sorcery, spell casting and myth. Softly, so as not to disturb the boys'' mood, Cymon went on. </p>\r\n<p>"But, as I said, he wasn''t always a wizard. Once he was just an elf, young by elfin time. Born into the tribe of warriors, he quickly rose through the ranks to command his own company. Then came the time of the Hurian Wars. </p>\r\n<p>The Huri were, like the Elfin, one of the older Races. But unlike the Elfin, they became greedy and in their search for greater knowledge, delved into the mysteries of the Black Arts. They began to imagine themselves superior to the other races and to look down on them as lesser creatures, whose intolerable existence should be wiped from the Earth. So they waged war on them, to destroy them all. Even united, the other Races were no match for the Hurian sorcery and they began to despair. Then, when things were at their worst...&nbsp;help arrived! Nobody knew where they came from, for never had their like been seen before: five, glorious beasts, awesome in their beauty and might, as tall as ten men and twice as long. From their horned heads, to the tips of their pointed tails, they were covered in iridescent scales that nothing could penetrate. They rode the winds on huge wings as soft as well-worn leather. Razor sharp claws that could slice a man in two were seen to tenderly lift a baby out of harms way without so much as a scratch. Fierce and terrifying yet infinitely gentle were these awesome Dragons.</p>\r\n<p>Each of them chose one. To ride its back in battle: </p>\r\n<p>From the race of Man, Gregos was chosen. </p>\r\n<p>From the Dwarves: Palach. </p>\r\n<p>From the Soyex: U''min. </p>\r\n<p>From the Fellis: Torje.</p>\r\n<p>And from the Elfin: Duman! </p>\r\n<p>Why, and how, the great beasts picked those particular warriors: is known only to them. All we know is that each one was skilled and courageous in battle, without pride or conceit for their deeds and willing to sacrifice themselves for their men and for the innocent.</p>\r\n<p>By this choosing, Rider and Dragon became linked in some mysterious way, communicating by mind and emotion. They flew into battle at the front of the armies, laying waste to the enemy and leaving the ground troops to mop up any resistance. But the greatest weapon they brought was the ability to withstand the Huri magic. White fire issued forth from their mouths devouring the unnatural forces. Back, and back again, retreated the once mighty Huri, until they had only one stronghold left. The mountain they called Runic. None of the Races had a translation of this, so its true meaning remains obscure. Others called it Shadow Mountain. The Elfin call it ''Ak''thai''.</p>\r\n<p>As the armies encamped around Ak''thai, Duman captured a Huri spy...&nbsp;a mystery in itself. He spent long hours alone, interrogating him. After many days he called the other Riders together and told them that, not only had he found a way to end this war once and for all but, if they so desired, a way which would enable the Races to retain the balance of power against the Huri, so that the Dragons could return to their home. His offer was sincere and genuine, or so it was believed at the time. So did the Dark Magic allow Duman to believe perhaps, as its insidious nature wormed its way into his heart corrupting him totally and irrevocably... only Duman knows the truth of his heart at that time. Under the guise of aiding their friends on their homeward journey, Duman lured the other four Riders and their Dragons to the place he had prepared. The warriors he interned in an unknown, crystal tomb. The Orbs now containing the Dragons, he kept with him in Ak''thai. Then he returned to the camp, saying that the Huri had surrendered, the war was over and everyone, like the Dragons, could all go home. They didn''t argue. Why would they? This was a warrior hero whom they trusted, besides, they''d been away from their loved ones for too long and were eager to get home. </p>\r\n<p>Only one thing marred Duman’s victory, making it incomplete. Ecos had not been with the others and Duman could not find him anywhere.&nbsp;Too late to save his brothers, Ecos concentrated on thwarting Duman as best he could and in doing so, leave hope and help to be found in the future. He centred all his power and focused it into his eyes, half in each. Ignoring the pain he removed them from his body and using the little power he had retained for the purpose, encased them in amber, for he knew that this and only this, could conceal the Powers'' presence from Duman. He sent them far away. To lay hidden in separate locations until found by one with a pure heart. A silent prayer echoed in the wind that the one would use the Power, to put right the wrong that had been done that day. </p>\r\n<p>When Duman at last discovered Ecos and realised what he''d done, he was enraged and turned him into stone &mdash; dead, but not dead. The last remnant of the once powerful Dragon destined to be forever, a silent and powerless witness to his brothers'' enforced slavery to evil. And there, so legend states, they all remain. For many centuries Duman has searched for the ''Eyes of Ecos''. Many believe it''s only this search that keeps him from turning his attention to the other Races, like the Huri before him."</p>\r\n<p>Utter silence filled the room as Cymon finished his tale. Tears slid down Jarok’s cheeks as, for long moments, he continued to dwell with the long-forgotten Heroes. He felt anguish for the loss of Duman to the forces of evil and great sadness at his betrayal of his brothers-in-arms. He felt the despair of the trusting Dragons that placed themselves in the hands of one they thought their friend and who then forced them into a servitude so against their nature. He grieved for them all and for Ecos, fated to an eternity of guilt, blaming himself for not acting sooner as the glimmer of hope he had planted faded with every passing century, until there was nothing left but the painful acceptance of reality. Jarok longed for a way to help them. Cymon bent down to wipe away his tears. His hand fell short as a soft moan came from Alyse. </p>\r\n<p>She had long since stopped her sewing and sat, eyes fixed in his direction, in horror and fear. Her hands were upside her cheeks and she was sobbing. Cymon’s words about the ''Eyes of Ecos'' had brought clarity to the dreams that had been disturbing her. Pictures blinked on and off in her mind. She saw the glowing, orange aura of the amber stone. She remembered staring deep into its liquid centre that flowed like molten lava: Ever moving, alive, luring her closer and closer into its kaleidoscope of multi-coloured motion. She recalled the coldness of its casing in her palm, of comparing it to the warmth emitted from within, the way it throbbed in her hand, pulsing beneath her fingertips as she stroked it in wonder. She recognised now the murmuring voices encouraging her as she lifted it up to her face. Encouraging her, as she placed her own eye against it for a closer look at its enticing centre. She screamed out in agony as white-hot needles stabbed into her eye, clawing at her face in an effort to remove them.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon and Jarok were at her side in an instant. Cymon held her arms to prevent her from hurting herself, while Jarok called her name over and over, trying to bring her out of her nightmare. She began to shake uncontrollably, all colour draining from her face, and then she slumped unconscious into Cymon’s arms. Jarok, frightened by this behaviour from his normally solid sister, tugged frantically at Cymon’s shirt.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s the matter with her, Cymon," he cried, in a voice thick with dread. Cymon shook his head. The boy was frightened enough, without hearing his suspicions. Drat the Elders! They knew of this. They should have sent someone to help and guide the child, not an ignorant youth that knew only the ways of battle. What were they thinking of? But he said none of this to Jarok, instead he forced a broad grin and as light-heartedly as he could, made up the best excuse he could think of.</p>\r\n<p>"She really got into that one! I guess I''m a better story teller than I thought."</p>\r\n<p>It sounded worse than lame, even to his ears. Jarok obviously thought so too.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not that much of a child, Cymon," he replied resentfully.</p>\r\n<p>"I know and I''m sorry for treating you like one. The truth is, I don''t know what''s wrong."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok followed Cymon into the bedroom, pulling down the blankets as he laid Alyse on the bed. They sat on opposite sides of her. Jarok took her hand and laid his cheek in her palm. Cymon leaned over and put his arm around the boys'' shoulders as he began to cry. Gazing at them both, so young and vulnerable, Cymon decided he would have to convince Alyse to allow him to take them both home immediately and not take ''no'' for an answer. He should never have waited so long, he berated himself. He sat with his arm about Jarok until the boy had cried himself out and began to sway tiredly. Then he swept his legs round, easing him onto the bed beside Alyse. He did not even consider separating them, even though Jarok would have been more comfortable in his own bed. He paused in the doorway for a final glance at the sleeping pair. As he did so, Royle padded into the room, unaffected by the scene he had just witnessed. Cymon envied the cat his ignorance as with feline grace, he leapt onto the pillow and curled up beside Alyse’s head, purring gently in her ear with a soft, soothing rhythm that hardly disturbed the silence.</p>\r\n<p>"I leave them in your tender care, Sir Royle," Cymon whispered, pulling the door closed behind him. "But if it''s all the same to you," he poked his head back in, "just for tonight, I think I''ll stay by the fire."</p>\r\n<p>A gleaming eye winked once at him before closing, as if in unspoken agreement and permission of the elf’s'' request.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>', 1, 19, 11, 1, 1, '2012-02-28 17:01:02', 1, '2012-02-28 17:01:02');

He put his hands on the cause of the pestering as he opened his eyes and yawned widely, in an effort to wake himself fully. Royle sat staring at him with a mixture of impatience and disgust. He had similar feelings towards himself for falling asleep. His heart jolted and he jumped out of the chair and ran into the bedroom. To his relief Alyse and Jarok were both still sleeping soundly. He could see their undisturbed forms, just as he had left them, in the moonlight that filtered through the window. Jarok was snoring softly, mouth slightly open with his head tilted back off the edge of the bed. Alyse had not moved at all, her face even paler in the cold, silver light of the moon. Maybe Royle just needed to go out, he thought, returning to the kitchen to find Royle, hackles up, gouging deep marks into the wood as he scrapped his claws down the obstructing door &mdash; something more than a call of nature was bothering the cat. Cymon opened the door and stepped outside. All was quiet and still. Nothing moved and as far as he could tell, nothing was amiss. Turning back to give the cat a good telling off for frightening him so, the words stuck in his throat. Royle was paused in the threshold, back arched high in warning as a low, deep-throated growl gave way to a furious spitting. Behind him his tail twitched back and forth in extreme agitation. This was one serious cat!<p></p>\r\n<p>Cymon turned back into the night, cautiously moving further into the clearing, trying to follow the cats'' line of sight. Conditions were not to his favour, for though the clearing was bathed in moonlight, the shrub and the edge of the forest beyond were pitch black. At first he could see nothing, save the dark outline of the trees but concentrating all his senses he spied, out of the corner of his eye, two sickly-yellow eyes peering maliciously from beyond the shrub line. When he looked directly at them, they were gone. Now that he knew what he was looking for, he scanned the area again. There, off to the left towards the barn, was another set. A quick check verified it was not the same creature that had moved. He had not thought it would be, for if they were what he suspected, they never hunted alone. </p>\r\n<p>He searched again but could find only these two. Where were the rest?</p>\r\n<p>‘Who cares?’ he thought to himself. ‘Two is enough!’</p>\r\n<p>"I could do with some help out here," he whispered tensely over his shoulder. Royle remained at his post. He looked anxiously at the defenceless elf, but was loathe leaving his mistress and master alone. Suddenly, his tail stiffened and he gave a loud warning ''Reouw'' as the eyes moved. After that, everything seemed to happen at once. Both creatures, leapt from their’ hiding places simultaneously, their grotesque bodies absorbing any light around them, and bounded each to its separate quarry, one straight at Cymon, the other toward the barn. Instinct took over. Cymon let out a shrill whistle to summon Defiant. At the same time as one hand pulled out the harmless flute he had been teaching Jarok to play, the other retrieved a tiny, spine-like dart tucked into his belt. With a speed that defied the eye, he pointed the dart at its target, murmuring softly as he placed it into the mouthpiece of the flute, which he then raised to his mouth. The dart sped across the clearing. The creature twisted as the dart hit but it kept on coming. Cymon backed up, letting loose another dart.</p>\r\n<p>Defiant was already on his way when Cymon’s whistle cut the night, mane and tail flying behind and his scream of challenge filling the night in front. Moonlight radiated his body, setting it aglow as, like a silver dart himself, he thundered down on the approaching enemy. Momentarily surprised by his appearance, the creature hesitated. Only a moment but it was all Defiant needed to reach his target and, rearing up on hind quarters, bring the full force of his weight and hatred down upon its back, neatly snapping it in two. A howl of pain resounded in the night as the helpless creature writhed upon the ground. Lost in the thrill of long-awaited battle, Defiant continued to rain blows down upon his victim until all that was left was an unrecognisable mass of bloody fur.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile Jarok, who had been woken by Cymon’s whistle, wandered sleepily into the kitchen to find out what was going on. Halfway across the room he was hit in the chest by a lightening bolt of spitting fur, that sent him tumbling backwards to crack his head on the edge of the table before hitting the floor with a thud. A wet tongue expressed apology then sped off, leaving him dazed and confused. His position left him no view of the outside scene but judging by the noises he heard, he was glad of it.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon heard both the howl of pain from Defiant'' direction and the commotion in the kitchen but had no time to spare a glance for either. Three, four darts had found their mark in quick succession, yet still the infernal beast kept coming. Slower than before, still its pace left no time for a fifth as it sprung. Having no other weapon to hand, Cymon crouched low, hoping the beast would pass over him and so give him the chance for another dart before it could attack again. He turned his back as he dropped so he would be facing it ready and besides, if it didn''t miss...&nbsp;he would rather not see it coming! He cursed himself for literally being caught napping and prayed fervently that if he should go down, Defiant would get the children to Phelise without him. As it turned out, neither happened. Instead, he heard a bestial scream and looked up just in time to see the beast land heavily on its side, with Royle clinging desperately to its head. Furiously, the creature tried to dislodge the cat that ripped at its ears, spitting and snarling and driving needle-sharp claws ever deeper into its eyes. Blinded, it could not see Defiant approaching... but Royle did and quickly twisted himself clear as lethal hooves sliced through the foul creatures'' muzzle, teeth following down to tear open the exposed jugular... just in case.</p>\r\n<p>Peace reigned once more in the clearing, except for the low gurgling of the dying beast as its lifeblood seeped into the ground. A final twitch and that too was silenced. The three friends stood catching their breath and shared for a moment that unexplainable comradeship of triumphant singularity that only those who have faced death together and survived can understand. A soft groan from the cottage broke the mood and while Cymon and Royle went inside, Defiant trotted off to check the area, in the hope of finding some more unwelcome visitors. His blood was up and he was in fine fettle. He hadn''t had this much fun for ages! </p>\r\n<p>In the kitchen, Cymon lit the lantern and placed it on the floor beside Jarok, who was slumped against a chair in obvious pain.</p>\r\n<p>"What happened to you?" Cymon asked him.</p>\r\n<p>"I came out to see what all the noises were about, when somebody," he stared accusingly at Royle, "sent me flying and I hit my head."</p>\r\n<p>"Lucky for you he did, or you could''ve ended up with much worse," replied Cymon. Somewhat unsympathetically Jarok thought, as the elf traced light fingers over the back of his head. Finding a large lump (at which Jarok gave a loud ''ouch'') but no blood, he patted the boy on the back and assured him he would live.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s easy for you to say," Jarok winced as he prodded the lump. " You''re not the one standing outside this headache!" </p>\r\n<p>Cymon laughed, pleased to see that sleep had restored the boys'' equilibrium, and helped him to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"I think you''d better sit back down for a bit," he advised as Jarok swayed from side to side. </p>\r\n<p>"What happened out there?" Jarok asked, wincing again. Despite the pain, he couldn''t stop probing the lump now he knew it was there. Cymon covered it with a wet towel and placed Jarok’s hand over it to keep it occupied.</p>\r\n<p>"I haven''t got time to explain fully just now but remember in the story, I mentioned Duman’s search? Well, we just had a visit from a few of his servants. They''re called Citog. Wolf-like creatures with one thing on their minds... to kill." Cymon regretted his words immediately as Jarok’s eyes widened in alarm. "Don''t worry," he reassured the boy while he berated himself silently for all kinds of a fool. "Defiant, Royle and I took care of them. But we need to leave here quickly so you need to do exactly as I tell you without question. Will you do that?"</p>\r\n<p>"Where will we go? What about Alyse? Will she be able to travel?" asked Jarok, even as he nodded his acquiescence.</p>\r\n<p>''So much for no questions!'' Cymon smiled to himself.</p>\r\n<p>"We''re going to Phelise. You''ll be safe there," Cymon answered patiently. "As for Alyse, we have no choice but to take a chance. You''ll hold her in front of you on Defiant. D''you think you can do that?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course," replied Jarok, slightly miffed that Cymon had felt the need to ask.</p>\r\n<p>"Good!" Cymon held up his hands to forestall further questions. "Now, I want you to gather as much food as you can, some spare clothes and some blankets. When you''ve done that, wake Alyse and tell her to wait for me here. I''m going to the barn, I won''t be long."</p>\r\n<p>Trusting Jarok to perform his tasks, Cymon went to the barn, where Defiant was now waiting after a disappointing (for him) and fruitless reconnoitre. Expert, nimble fingers soon had the horse saddled and ready to go. Cymon pulled the nose-bag from its hook and half-filled it with grain and on top of that, a few of the stored vegetables, a spare lantern, a pigskin of oil and a coil of rope. Defiant snorted his disapproval as Cymon hung the bulging bag on the pommel.</p>\r\n<p>"I know. You''re not a packhorse. But in an emergency, needs must. As soon as I can, I will make other arrangements."</p>\r\n<p>Glancing around for other useful items, he spied the scythe resting against the far wall. He picked it up and snapped off the length of the handle across his knee, leaving just enough for a sure grip, then hefted it in his hand and smiled, fairly pleased with the result. </p>\r\n<p>"It''ll do," he muttered to Defiant’s chuffing, giving it an experimental swipe through the air. Still somewhat cumbersome to what he was used to, it would nonetheless, be more effective than the darts which had already proven fairly hopeless against the Citog. Besides, he only had five left and he wasn''t about to try and remove the others from the body outside. Carefully sliding the blade up inside his jerkin, he tucked what was left of the handle into his belt. He felt a lot less vulnerable, as he eased the blade into a comfortable position against his back.</p>\r\n<p>"Just as long as I don''t slice myself in two getting it out,” he joked to Defiant, who was prancing impatiently from side to side. "You''re right. Time to go."</p>\r\n<p>Defiant followed as he made his way back to the cottage. Passing the woodpile, he picked up the axe lying there and slipped it into his belt. Jarok was sitting at the table, his face full of worry and tear streaks, when Cymon got back. </p>\r\n<p>"I can''t wake Alyse," he cried, even before Cymon had gotten through the door. "I shook her and shook her but she won''t wake up."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon hurried to Alyse. She was indeed completely unresponsive even to his most vigorous efforts. He rubbed his hand over his chin. Indecision warred within him, as Jarok’s question returned. Would it be safe to move her in this condition? Maybe not, but it would be less safe to remain here, his common sense answered.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps it''s better this way," he said, placing a comforting hand on Jarok’s shoulder. "At least she won''t be able to argue with us about going on this trip!" He spoke lightly, showing none of the concern he was feeling, to calm the boys'' disquiet and was rewarded with a faint smile. Wrapping Alyse up in a blanket, Cymon carried her outside while Jarok followed with his bundles. As soon as Jarok was comfortable aboard Defiant, Cymon handed Alyse up to him, taking the weight until he was sure Jarok had her safely settled before letting go completely. </p>\r\n<p>"Oh, I nearly forgot,” said Jarok. "I found these in fathers'' trunk." Wriggling in such an alarming manner that seemed sure to unseat them both, he produced two matching hunting knives for Cymon’s inspection. Cymon held the knives loosely in his hands. They were well weighted. Double edged, one side was serrated two thirds of the way up its length, and then it curved inwards to meet the straight blade of the other side at the gleaming tip. The hilts were tightly bound with strips of leather, moulded to ensure a firm grip with workmanship very reminiscent of elfin style. Cymon was delighted and, thanking Jarok with a broad smile, he slipped one down the top of each boot. </p>\r\n<p>"I kept this one for myself." Jarok stretched out his hand, which had Alyse’s small paring knife attached to the end of it. Only Cymon’s speedy reaction saved him from having one nostril instead of two.</p>\r\n<p>"Whoa! I''m on your side warrior, remember?" he whistled in alarm, grabbing the boys'' wrist and taking hold of the knife.</p>\r\n<p>"Am I really a warrior?" asked Jarok eagerly, rising excitement at the idea lifting his dark mood of apprehension.</p>\r\n<p>"If you swing this at the enemy as neatly as you almost stuck me with it, you certainly have the makings of one," replied Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"Then it''s alright for me to keep it? After all, a warrior needs a weapon," he held out his hand hopefully.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course," Cymon handed the knife back. "But tuck it away for now. You''ll need both hands to look after Alyse. The first lesson in Warrior-ship is to get things in order of priority and right now, holding on to Alyse is your main concern."</p>\r\n<p>“Yes, Sir,” replied Jarok, immediately tucking the knife away and wrapping his hands so securely about Alyse, Cymon feared she might suffocate. </p>\r\n<p>With the extra bundles secured along with the nosebag (much to Defiants disgust) the company set off. As they walked, Cymon cautiously checked for any signs that Citog had been, or were, in the area. The last thing he needed was to walk straight into a trap. He couldn''t understand why the two Citog had attacked. They were obviously scouts and would normally await the arrival of the ensuing pack, an average of eight to ten, before doing anything. At least, that was what he had been told. He could only surmise it was down to the fact they realised they had been spotted. Cymon blessed the cat. They could never have taken on the whole pack unprepared. The poor thing had gone clean out of his mind. Not that he need worry, Royle could certainly take care of himself but he felt a little guilty that he had not spared the animal a second thought. He finally spotted Royle some way back bringing up the rear, dropping off out of sight then running to catch up. His calm demeanour and relaxed, fluid movements released some of the pressure off Cymon’s shoulders. They were not being followed... yet.</p>\r\n<p>Their progress was slow at first. Added to Cymon’s caution, their way was hampered by stones, uneven ground and exposed roots that threatened a turned ankle, or worse, underfoot, while low-hung branches had Jarok ducking this way and that to avoid being knocked off. None of this was helped by the fact that the moonlight failed to penetrate the heavy canopy above. Defiant picked his way as carefully as he could but still, Jarok was finding it hard going. His sister was heavier than she looked and becoming more so with every passing league. She kept sliding downwards, sending him off-balance until he hitched her up again &mdash; invisible branches whipped across his face with stinging slaps. He tried keeping his eyes shut to protect them but that only made it more difficult in the balance department. His muscles soon began to ache but he bit down on his lip, determined to do his part without complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Things became slightly easier when the sun rose and the journey took on an ethereal quality in the early morning mist, that rose from the forest litter to play around the soft rays of the sun streaking through the branches overhead and sparkled on the newly formed dew, glistening on the strands of spider webs strung along their way. Lost in the beauty of the new dawn Jarok managed, if only for a while, to forget his exhaustion and the pain of protesting flesh.</p>\r\n<p>They came upon an old deer track, which offered easier passage plus had the advantage of not leaving behind a clear trail a blind man could follow. Cymon sent Defiant on ahead, while he crossed over into the opposite undergrowth. Marking a clear trail for some distance, he doubled back then took off in yet another direction, just to confuse things a bit more, before sprinting after Jarok. Travelling faster alone, it was not long before he had them in sight. He stopped a little way back, slightly bent with his hands on hips, puffing to catch his breath. He had not realised he was so badly out of shape. Alyse’s cooking had a lot to answer for! As he jogged up behind Defiant he noted Jarok’s slumped and tired posture. They would have to stop soon. Immediately the thought crossed his mind a faint howl of rage echoed across the distance on the wind. Undoubtedly the remainder of the pack had just found their fallen comrades. Though distant, it was still possible to detect the menacing promise of revenge and, anxious that Jarok had also heard the cry, he hurried forward to reassure him with his presence.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok," he said softly, touching the boys'' thigh. Pity welled up in Cymon’s heart as Jarok looked down at him, white-faced with exhaustion. Hunted or not, they would have to stop. "Not much further and then we''ll stop and rest."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m fine," insisted Jarok, trying to straighten his back without groaning.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve no doubt about it," Cymon replied gently. "But Defiant''s looking the worse for wear. He''s going to need rest if he''s to continue carrying both of you and the load."</p>\r\n<p>Understanding of both this unintended insult to his strength and stamina and the boys'' need to prove his worth, Defiant gave an obliging stumble to confirm Cymon’s words. Jarok quickly forgot his own pride and apologised to the horse for being so insensitive. Patting both boy and horse, Cymon said he was going to scout ahead for a suitable campsite. He soon reappeared and waving them forward, led them just off the track and around a thick area of brush, behind which the ground sloped gently downwards. A large boulder seemed to block their path until Cymon picked his way around to the left of it, to a ledge concealed from above by the boulder.</p>\r\n<p>He lifted Alyse down and carried her to the back of the space for maximum protection, then returned for Jarok, who had suddenly found that his muscles refused to move. Cymon was filled with admiration for the uncomplaining boy whose drained face and white-knuckled fists, which clung grimly to the reins, bespoke that he had long since exhausted his stamina and had kept going on sheer determination alone. As he sat him down next to Alyse, Cymon hoped he would be able to get some food into him before he fell asleep. Relieved of his load and saddle, Defiant trotted into the trees. Cymon followed him as far as the brush. Cutting a section from the centre of a bush where it would be less noticeable, he dragged the branches behind him to obscure their tracks then wedged them firmly beside the boulder, concealing the entrance to all but the most persistent eyes.</p>\r\n<p>After lighting a small fire, Cymon knelt beside Jarok’s bundles and began going through them. Again the boy amazed him, this time with his initiative and commonsense. There was nothing that would cause unnecessary weight. A change of clothes for each of them, plus a couple of extra shirts; an oilskin sheet, big enough to cover Alyse should the weather turn nasty; three loaves; half a cheese; some dried mushrooms, tomatoes and apples; and a package of assorted herbs. With that, plus his vegetables, they should have enough to last the week. Jarok had also included a small, lightweight cooking pot, three sets of utensils, a skin of water, a half dozen candles plus a tinderbox that he had filled with matches. He had wrapped it all in the blankets rather than putting it in sacks and even the string he had tied them with was doubled, so it would be of a reasonable length should the need for any arise.</p>\r\n<p>"The boy''s a natural," Cymon whispered to himself, quickly throwing a few vegetables in the pot to soften. He looked up as Jarok took one of the blankets.</p>\r\n<p>"The ground''s hard," he said, rolling the blanket into a pillow and slipping under Alyse’s head. Deathly white, ice cold and totally motionless, an occasional moan was the only sign she gave that she wasn''t already a corpse. Helplessness and fear written in every line of his small body, Jarok did not look much better as he gazed up with pleading eyes as Cymon approached silently begging for help but Cymon had none to give. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry, Jarok," he said quietly, pulling the blanket covering Alyse up under her chin, "but</p>\r\n<p>I''m as much at a loss as you. But we have excellent healers at home who will know what to do." He tried to sound positive.</p>\r\n<p>"How long will it take us to get there?" </p>\r\n<p>"I couldn''t say until we get out of the forest and I can get my bearings," he answered evasively. How could he tell the distraught youngster it would take weeks... and that, only if they were lucky? "All I can tell you for now, is that the gateway to Phelise lies in the Anatol Mountains."</p>\r\n<p>It was at this point, with Jarok staring at him blankly, that Cymon suddenly remembered the boy had no idea who he really was. </p>\r\n<p>"Come and sit with me by the fire," he said, taking his hand. "You need to eat and I have something to tell you." He filled them a bowl each, refusing to look at Jarok’s questioning eyes until both their stomachs were full. Jarok had barely swallowed his last mouthful before he asked Cymon what it was he wanted to tell him.</p>\r\n<p>"Firstly, don''t be frightened. Secondly, I want you to know that Alyse knew of this...&nbsp;I swear." </p>\r\n<p>"I believe you Cymon."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you, it makes this easier," said Cymon and taking a deep breath, waved his hand to reveal his true identity as he explained to Jarok all that he had told Alyse. When he had finished, Jarok gave a low whistle.</p>\r\n<p>"So you think this Duman is after Alyse?" he asked with unexpected bluntness.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was slightly taken aback by the boys'' reaction. No tears, no trace of shock or fear, simply a calm acceptance of the facts. It seemed that the facts he could deal with... no matter what they were... it was the unknown that scared him. And because of this, he decided to go further. If the boy could cope, he deserved to know exactly what was going on. He looked Jarok squarely in the eye.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, I do. I also suspect more than the Elders told me."</p>\r\n<p>"What do you mean?" Jarok’s intensity revealed more than mere curiosity. There was a deep concern for Alyse and hope that whatever Cymon was about to say may, in some way, help them to help her.</p>\r\n<p>"These are only suspicions, mind you." Cymon emphasized by tapping his temple with his finger. "They''re not certain truths, remember that. At first I didn''t question the Elders motives for sending me," he went on when Jarok nodded, "until I met you both. Then I could see no reason why Duman should want to harm her. When I told Alyse about myself, she said she had never heard of Duman but I wasn''t so sure, even though she may have believed that herself. Something in her eyes suggested different. So I decided to test my theory and that''s why I told you the ''Ballad of Duman''." Cymon dropped his head into his hands and sighed heavily. "I''m so sorry Jarok. I never meant for it to turn out this way." The eyes that gazed back up at Jarok were filled with remorse. "But I think...&nbsp;that is...&nbsp;I''m afraid that I''m responsible for Alyse’s condition," he finally blurted out. Fully expecting Jarok to rail at him, and deservedly so, Cymon looked up in surprise when he felt a light touch on his arm. </p>\r\n<p>"Did you do it deliberately to harm her?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course not,” cried Cymon aghast.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I forgive you."</p>\r\n<p>But Cymon was not so ready to forgive himself and slapped himself angrily on the forehead.</p>\r\n<p>"How could I have been so stupid? The Elders are wiser than me. I should''ve obeyed their commands and revealed nothing," he cried with scathing self-accusation.</p>\r\n<p>"But you have," said Jarok in a voice so like Alyse’s Cymon had to smile. "So you might as well tell me the rest."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon took a moment to gather his thoughts before beginning.</p>\r\n<p>"Whatever I saw flash in her eyes, it was not of Alyse. I think, when she heard the story it forced her to remember something: Something from the dreams perhaps? Something she wasn''t ready to face. I think that''s what brought about her collapse."</p>\r\n<p>"What do you mean? ''Not of Alyse''." Jarok frowned.</p>\r\n<p>"Think back to the story. Remember, in its amber casing the power of Ecos is safe from detection, unless found by accident any search would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. The Citog were on us almost immediately after Alyse collapsed. There''s only one reason why Duman would know exactly where to send them. He must have detected the Power." Cymon saw the understanding beginning to dawn on Jarok’s face and nodded. </p>\r\n<p>"I think the Eyes'' of Ecos'' have been found... and used on Alyse!"</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 19, 11, 2, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45'),
(15, 'A change of plan', 'CHAPTER THREE', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<p>"FAILED?" </p>\r\n<p>The word buffeted the figure, standing head bowed in the centre of the room, with the full force of the wizard’s anger. Underneath the black robe it began to shake. Beads of perspiration trickled down the misshapen face that was barely recognisable as human. It kept its hands hidden and its eyes fixed firmly on the floor.</p>\r\n<p>"What do you mean: ''you failed''?" The wizard’s anger grew with every word until the air was so thick with it there was scarcely room for air to breathe. "I send you with a pack of Citog," he continued without waiting for an answer. "An entire pack mark you, against two mere children. Let me see," he began counting on his fingers, "that''s five per child? And you dare. You dare," his voice boomed up into the curved dome and came echoing back down the walls, "to come back here and report to me of failure?"</p>\r\n<p>The black robed figure kept still as he heard the footfalls of the approaching wizard, swallowing the bile that arose in his throat as he felt the threat of death, and worse, wash over him in promise. The wizard''s slippers came into view of his downcast eyes and he felt the body lean over him as lips pressed against his ear in a mirthless laugh.</p>\r\n<p>"Hogeth!" </p>\r\n<p>He heard his name called in deceitful sweetness. </p>\r\n<p>"Hogeth! Hogeth!" </p>\r\n<p>He felt the shake of the wizard’s head accompanying his name.</p>\r\n<p>"Did you think I would reward you for this information?" </p>\r\n<p>His masters'' softly amused whisper was more terrifying than his anger. As Hogeth ventured to explain in an effort to alleviate the wizard’s anger, his voice trembled and cracked, so that he was forced to swallow a number of times before he could get any words out. The tapping foot in his line of vision did nothing to loosen his tied tongue or quell his rising fear. </p>\r\n<p>"Master, I believe they had help," he finally managed to croak.</p>\r\n<p>The tapping ceased. Hogeth’s heart pounded painfully. Duman grabbed the hood of the robe yanking Hogeth’s head back viciously, and stared fully into the eyes of the pathetic, trembling creature in front of him. </p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Duman" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Duman" src="Duman01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>"Please, Master!" Hogeth pleaded at the sight of the white fire that flashed in the wizard’s eyes.</p>\r\n<p>“Help? What help?" demanded Duman, enforcing his question with a bolt of fire that burned a hole in the ground at Hogeth’s feet... a warning as to his fate should his words fail to please. Totally immune to Hogeth’s continuing pleas for mercy, Duman held him with invisible bonds that tightened when he tried to flee by slipping his robe.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell me quickly," he demanded, his words both warning and order.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know, Master." Explanations and excuses tumbled from his mouth as the bonds squeezed his throat. "The two scouts were already dead when the rest of us arrived. Their premature attack was of their volition. I ordered them to locate and survey only. If they hadn''t paid the price for their disobedience, I would have killed them myself." The bonds on his throat stopped squeezing. And gaining courage by this, his words flowed more easily. "We found horse tracks and those of a man... but only one other set... not two. I sent two more Citog to scout the immediate area for any sign of the second child. The remaining six, I sent in pursuit with strict orders, on the pain of your displeasure, to destroy the man only and to hold the child until my return." Released completely from the bonds, Hogeth relaxed and sought to ingratiate himself still further. "I thought it my duty to return and inform you of this development. I know I deserve your anger Master, but I sought only to serve you."</p>\r\n<p>Duman’s arm shot out, a long fingernail making a small indentation in the skin at the throat of his minion. He was neither fooled nor appeased by the sickly fawning.</p>\r\n<p>"Do not try me too far, worm," he warned, the long, drawn-out words terrifyingly calm. "You are easily replaced."</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth sagged to his knees as Duman slowly withdrew his hand and began pacing the room, deep in concentration. His flowering confidence de-headed, he cowered, grateful for the reprieve that left his throat intact. He did not move a muscle during the long silence, not wanting to attract his Masters'' attention again so soon.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps you did well after all," murmured Duman, after much thought, "to bring this to my attention. So...&nbsp;they have protection? No matter. Return to your post," he ordered. "Take another pack with you. Do what you wish with the man and the boy... But I want the girl alive...&nbsp;and unharmed."</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth rose and carefully began to back out of the room.</p>\r\n<p>"Hogeth!"&nbsp;The wizard’s shout stopped him, frozen, in his tracks. A fingernail snaked out again, slicing down Hogeth’s face, opening it from forehead to muzzle. The wizard held up the eyeball sitting on the end of his bloodied nail, turning it about and inspecting it thoroughly as he spoke; threat and promise blatantly obvious in both the action and the deceptively calm voice. "Do not presume to escape so lightly should you fail me again."</p>\r\n<p>"I won''t fail you, Master," Hogeth promised through teeth clenched with pain, each word punctuated by the drip-drop of blood on his boots. He knew better than to try to stem the flow of it while still in the wizard’s presence.</p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t think you would," replied Duman, tossing the eye at its owner’s feet. A malicious grin of sadistic pleasure curled his mouth as he revelled in the sight of the evident pain he had inflicted. A quick flick of the wrist dismissed Hogeth from the room and from his mind. Hogeth hurried out closing the door silently behind him, never pausing until he was well away from the fortress.</p>\r\n<p>Duman continued pacing the room, his agitation growing with every step &mdash; so near, so close. It had almost been in his grasp. His thoughts kept pace with his steps. He shook his fist in the air with frustration, drawing blood as razor sharp nails cut into his palms. He threw back his head bellowing in rage.</p>\r\n<p>"I will not be thwarted again!" </p>\r\n<p>White fire vented some of his anger toward the ceiling when the words echoed back tauntingly.</p>\r\n<p>Thwarted again...&nbsp;again...&nbsp;aga... </p>\r\n<p>The air crackled behind him as he swept through the fortress on his way to the Summoning Chamber. He needed no light to guide his way, the fire in his eyes more than sufficient to illuminate the dim passageways. He paused before the stone figure that was once the living body of Ecos.</p>\r\n<p>"Run as you will," he sneered at it. "Your power will soon be mine, as is your body. You were no match for me then and you''re still not... and you know it." Deliberately, slowly, hatefully, he raked his nails into the shoulder. Brown wetness, like diluted mud, seeped out of the stone and water trickled from the hollow, eyeless cavities. Duman threw back his head in wicked laughter. The rune covered walls and floors vibrated in evil unison to mark his passing as he resumed his journey, along the dark ways of his domain to the room that held the Melding Orb... unaware others were already there.</p>\r\n<p>Brilliant colours swirled within the crystal, entwining faster and faster as they came together, filling it with rainbow mist. Ebullient voices issued forth.</p>\r\n<p>"They hath escaped!" </p>\r\n<p>"Who is this protector Yushok spoke of?" </p>\r\n<p>"Shalt I contact him again?" </p>\r\n<p>"No! ''Tis too dangerous at this time. Sufficed to know she is safe." </p>\r\n<p>"I canst feel his fury even from here. What joy it doth bring! </p>\r\n<p>"Let not thine elation make thee careless." </p>\r\n<p>"What canst he do? He needs us, else he is nothing!" </p>\r\n<p>"He canst keep us apart again." </p>\r\n<p>"And hast thou forgotten our friends, whose bodies he doth not need? Hath we the right to risk their chance of return for our own selfishness? Is one such sacrifice not enough?"</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, a ripple of gold flickered in the mist and a new voice sounded.</p>\r\n<p>"Hush now! All of thee are gone quickly. He cometh!" </p>\r\n<p>A swell of multi-coloured surprise was all time allowed before the mist dispersed, leaving the Orb clear save for a tinge of gold. It flared up in hatred, and then it too was gone. A heartbeat later the door swung open and Duman entered. The aura of high emotions in the room transmitted itself to him immediately but he put it down to a surfeit of his own highly charged senses, echoing back off the extremely sensitive rock formation of this particular room, and ignored it. No windows marred the perfection of the rooms'' polished, black walls and no torch brackets cut into its gleaming surfaces that ran spotless and unscarred around the circular room, reaching up to close over in a domed ceiling. It was pitch black except for the faint pure of the Orb. Duman glided across the black marble floor guided by the faint glow, the soft slippers on his feet making no noise to break the eerie silence. He stood before the only contents of the room. A plain chair, waiting empty beneath a round table fashioned from the same ebony wood. Yet whereas the chair was unadorned, the table was rich in intricate markings. Scored deep into its surface (but not by human hand) was a pentagram, its crossing lines reaching out to the very edges of the table. Inside each of its five triangles was marked a rune and in the middle rested an onyx tripod depicting innumerable forms of birds and animals. It was their stolen life force that gave power to the tripod, which in turn held captive the Orb resting upon it. Five more Orbs, identical to this one, were secreted within his fortress. This one...&nbsp;the sixth and most powerful...&nbsp;he used to tap into and control the forces that the other four contained.</p>\r\n<p>"Other Four,” he wailed plaintively to the domed ceiling whose indifferent silence echoed back, like a thunderclap, inflaming his inner torment into violent anger. Anger that sizzled dangerously from his fingertips at the taunting memory of the fifth, lying empty and useless in its resting place. Waiting... waiting...&nbsp;his eyes spit flashing sparks as his rage threatened to overpower him. He turned his back on the Orb, letting the easy darkness soothe his burning vision and took a deep, calming breath. He took another...&nbsp;and another...&nbsp;and another half dozen.</p>\r\n<p>Calm at last, he placed a hand over each rune in turn and as he did so, a small flame appeared at the tip of the triangle wherein the rune lay. He spoke the name of each rune as he joined one flame to another. A single flame was now resting upon the palm of his hand. He sat down and waved the fire in an arc about him. A protective shield of pulsing blue energy encompassed both himself and the table as the Orb started to hum in a low-pitched, monotonous tone that seemed to mesmerize the wizard, for his face took on a blank expression. Clearing his mind of every last vestige of distraction, Duman placed both hands upon the Orb’s cold, transparent exterior and stared into its depths. His breathing slowed until it was almost non-existent. A black dot appeared at the centre of the Orb. Smokey tendrils reached out from it, exploring the empty space within until they made contact with the inner surface. After a slight hesitation they retracted, heavily, as if drawing along a great weight. The brilliant blue mist entered the Orb with extreme reluctance. Quickly, the smoky-black dug into it, like the powerful talons of an eagle snatching its prey, and pulled backwards, dragging the blue in further still. A silent battle of wills, ensued between the two ethereal forces, but inevitably the blue was overcome and shrouded in blackness. As the helpless tree is smothered by the vine, so Duman’s will smothered the entire inner surface of the Orb, strangling the essence of the Dragon it had summoned. </p>\r\n<p>"Must we go through this charade every time, Tareb?" Duman’s silent voice rang inside the Orb in ridicule, crushing down upon the blue-mist of Tareb, in a boastful display of mastery. "We both know your feeble attempts at resistance are hopeless and quite frankly, it''s beginning to bore me!" </p>\r\n<p>"Our resistance is all thou hast left us,” replied Tareb, immediately realising his mistake and adding quickly when the black mist swirled suddenly. "If there wert no resistance, then I wouldst no longer be thine slave... but thine partner. Wouldst thou share thine position and thine power with me, Duman?" Just as he hoped, anger flared in the wizard, overriding his suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>"NEVER!" roared Duman. "I alone hold dominion...&nbsp;and ever it shall be. Play your silly games if you so desire. They are of no consequence and profit you nothing." </p>\r\n<p>"They art of consequence to me. And they profit the Mother..." answered Tareb. Again Duman’s anger swirled the mists.</p>\r\n<p>"SHE... " Duman spat the word insultingly, "... shall soon be no more. All is within my grasp.&nbsp;Yes!" The word was dripping with greed and anticipation. "The fifth Orb will not be empty much longer." </p>\r\n<p>"Fifth Orb?" Tareb jumped in quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Duman caught hold of himself, cursing his slip. Containment within the Orbs wiped the memory of each other from the minds of the Dragons. So he had planned it. Banded together they were a formidable power, which he preferred to keep separate, using separately until his search was complete. When he had the five, then and only then, would he unite them, absorb their power, destroy the Mother and take Her place...&nbsp;thus giving him utter and total domination over every living thing on the Earth. He was too close to risk losing it all now, because of a careless tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing that need concern you," he replied to Tareb’s query, once more in control of himself.</p>\r\n<p>"As thou sayest...&nbsp;master." </p>\r\n<p>The deep blue paled and was sucked into the centre of the Orb as Duman drew upon the Dragon’s power. A great cloud filtered into the room. It rose up, permeating the domed roof and re-appeared above the fortress, hovering a moment before spreading northwest, towards the cottage where Alyse and Jarok had lived. Duman felt for the ''hum'' that revealed the power he sought and followed it westward, to the ledge where they had been encamped. He paused. The resonance was different to that of the other Dragons &mdash; fainter, as though it had been altered or contaminated, dampening its intensity. Straining further, to locate its exact position and determine what was amiss, he was suddenly struck by a fiery bolt of energy and recoiled in pain. </p>\r\n<p>"So your pain shall rise when I have you... and I will make no mistake about that. In the Orb you will dwell Ecos, rest assured of that... you and your woman-child both!"&nbsp;Duman promised. A jagged streak of golden lightning displaced the cloud and he pulled back quickly, returning to the safety of the Orb. He was disappointed that he had been unable to locate their exact position but he now knew who the mysterious ''help'' was...&nbsp;the stench of Elf was unmistakable... and there was only one place an Elf would take them. Phelise!&nbsp;From their westerly direction, he guessed they were heading for the gateway in the Anatol Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>He was bout to dismiss the Dragon when he suddenly remembered Tareb’s first words and the black tendrils inside the Orb tightened, almost solidifying the mist.</p>\r\n<p>"Us!"&nbsp;Dumans voice was hard and cold as he expressed the word that had finally registered from Tareb’s slip.</p>\r\n<p>"Us, master?" Tareb’s voice questioned with just the right amount of bemusement while maintaining an untroubled, pale tint to his blue essence.</p>\r\n<p>"When I first summoned you, you said... ''It is all you have left us''. Us!" Duman stressed the word again. "What did you mean by it?" </p>\r\n<p>"Just mine self and mine power," replied Tareb innocently, desperately trying to keep his knowledge secret, as he sensed Duman probing deeper and deeper into him. "What else wouldst I mean?" he asked and to his immense relief, his ploy was once again successful. Duman ceased his probing immediately, to continue would have placed unnecessary and unwanted emphasis on what might simply be an innocent question. As soon as Duman opened the way, the blue mist retreated quickly from whence it came. </p>\r\n<p>Now alone, Duman’s essence receded once more to a singular, black dot that flicked in and out before disappearing completely. His body jerked back to full life with a gasp. He breathed deeply, encouraging his blood to circulate through previously suspended tissue. Spasmodic twitching moved the hands still frozen upon the Orb, energy sparking between them when he finally let go. Fully restored, he allowed the force field to dissipate. Massaging aching temples with small, circular movements of his fingertips, he mulled over the information he had received.</p>\r\n<p>The alteration of resonance he now dismissed as being caused by the intimate proximity of the girls'' human essence. He envisaged no problem to this minor hiccup however. The incarceration of a human form should be no more difficult than that of a Dragon, merely a matter of altering a few runes. Her essence could be easily discarded during absorption. The lack of substance in the force that hit him did cause him some concern however. He would have expected it to be greater and also because, even as it was, it managed to defeat him. He almost choked on the words but on further deliberation decided it was the surprise of the blow that had initiated pain and the unexpected pain that accounted for his withdrawal. Pain was good...&nbsp;On others! Yes, he told himself, it was a simple case of carelessness on his part. He had gone in unprepared, taking only enough force for his search and allowing nothing for defence and thus, without the power to retaliate, had left</p>\r\n<p>himself wide open and vulnerable. This was the reason he had been rebuffed, he assured himself. It would not happen again. As for the lack of strength present... well, what else could he expect from a feeble human mind? He knew from experience, even with his own superior psyche and great skill, it was something that took time and practice. All he had to do was get his hands on her before the Elfin did.</p>\r\n<p>"I should have done away with the whole race of them when I destroyed the tribe of Ephlon. And I never did recover the body of that interfering Yushok, for all that,” he shouted at the empty room. Yushok’s name brought him back to his suspicions over Tareb’s words and he lowered his eyes to stare into the depths of the now latent Orb. </p>\r\n<p>Was it possible? </p>\r\n<p>Could they? </p>\r\n<p>His lips twisted into a sneer as he recalled the ease of their ensnarement.</p>\r\n<p>"No," he laughed to himself, his confidence in his own abilities, and his underestimation and contempt for theirs, only too ready to dismiss his concerns as nonsensical paranoia brought on by the proximity of success. "They are stupid beasts, for all their power," he concluded, focusing his concentration back onto the capture of the girl.</p>\r\n<p>He would go after the brother. The grief of his death would overcome her senses (so previous experience with mankind led him to believe) and inhibit the arduous learning process she must go through to become accomplished in wielding the power. His power, he corrected. Plus, he would derive such pleasure from her suffering! He licked his lips in anticipation. His new course of action now clear in his mind, he left the room to send new instructions to Hogeth. The door closed behind him, the runes carved around its frame automatically activating the mystical seal as it clicked in place.</p>\r\n<p>He made his way through a maze of unlit corridors and up numerous flights of stairs to the west tower, going first to the window to gaze across the dark landscape towards the outside world. Somewhere out there was his destiny and he meant to claim it. For a long time he stared, though he could see little beyond the deep shadows cast by the heavy cloud above. Finally he turned away, to a cage hanging on a gilt stand. Home to a bat-like creature, about the same size as a falcon, with leathery wings and body and skinny legs that ended in long, sharp claws which it was using to dangle upside-down from its perch.</p>\r\n<p>When Duman opened the cage door it hopped eagerly onto his hand, basking in the light of Duman’s gaze. Totally devoted to its creator through love, not fear, it therefore made an excellent and trustworthy servant. Dirty hands grabbed the meat Duman offered.</p>\r\n<p>"Have you missed me, my sweet?" Duman asked the creature, caressing the matted hair hanging down its back. </p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="MySweet" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="My Sweet" src="MySweet01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>"Yes, Lord," it replied with an adoring gaze and carrion breath. Like its upper body and face, the creatures'' mind was of human origin giving it the capability of speech. Duman smiled and held out another piece of maggot-ridden meat. Tiny, rotten fangs tucked into the offering with a surfeit of slurping and drooling. When it had finished, it wiped its fingers through its hair. </p>\r\n<p>"I have a task for you," Duman stroked it under the chin with one finger.</p>\r\n<p>"Task, Lord?" cried the creature keenly, its whole body straining as it waited to hear how it might serve its beloved Master. Duman pulled an image from the air. With gentle fingers he turned the creatures'' gaze away from himself and onto the image, waiting patiently while it stared intently, taking in every detail.</p>\r\n<p>"This, is Hogeth," Duman told the harpy.</p>\r\n<p>"Know this one," it nodded vigorously.</p>\r\n<p>"Then your task will be easier. I want you to find him, somewhere in the middle forest. Tell him to call off the pursuit and intercept the party before they reach the Anatol Mountains. I want the boy destroyed in full view of the sister...&nbsp;my orders on her still stand. Let it be clear that I will tolerate no failure or excuses on either point. Do you remember this?" </p>\r\n<p>Duman praised the harpy with another titbit as the creature lovingly repeated the message word for word. </p>\r\n<p>"Stay to aid him as he wishes. Tell him it''s my desire that you, my sweet, have first fill of the remains. He will ensure the Citog understand and obey this command."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you, Lord." The rank breath washed over Duman’s face as it leant forward to place a kiss upon his cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"Go. Swiftly now," said Duman, with a lift of his hand. A flap of its wings and it was out the window. Soon it was just a black speck in the darkness. When he could see it no more, Duman retired to the couch in the corner to rest while he waited.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>', 1, 19, 11, 3, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(16, 'A wagon for Alyse', 'CHAPTER FOUR', '<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="N" src="N.gif">either Cymon or Jarok could find anything to say after Cymon had blurted out his suspicion about Alyse and the ''Eye'', so Cymon had said Jarok should try and get some sleep and Jarok had laid his head in Cymon’s lap while the elf sat staring into the dwindling fire wrestling with his guilt and anger. He blamed both himself and the Elders in turn, for Alyse’s mysterious condition and for the effect it must be having on Jarok even though he appeared to be coping extremely well. Duman, he cursed for his unwanted attention and also, whoever was responsible for using the ''Eye'' upon Alyse. This perhaps, worried him the most. Who and where was this mysterious person and who were they working for? Unable answer these questions, he returned to blaming the Elders for not revealing more of the truth and facts to him. Had they done so, he would have known to tread more carefully with Alyse, lest the very thing that had occurred should happen. But they had made it sound so easy and without danger. ''Protect and return''. Those had been their orders. Huh! He should have known better. If only he had not been so eager to get away from his Mother’s constant badgering, he might have delved deeper instead of simply accepting the ''too good to be true'', opportune assignment. Which thoughts had him once again blaming himself. And so the cycle continued.<p></p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s thoughts were equally mixed. Alyse was never ill and even before Cymon had mentioned the ''Eye'' he had sensed that this thing which held her was not normal. He was terrified she would not pull through and did not know what he would do without her. He knew Cymon would take care of him but nothing would be the same without Alyse. Tears welled but he blinked them away, concentrating on the quiet voice inside that said all would be well. He clung to this hope. He worried about Cymon too. Even though he had told the elf that he did not hold him responsible he knew Cymon still blamed himself. What would it do to Cymon if Alyse... Jarok dropped the thought there. She would recover... she had to! He sighed heavily and immediately Cymon began stroking his hair gently and humming a soft tune. His eyelids fluttered down and he drifted off to a land where he battled the evil wizard, rescued Alyse and rode off with her on a mighty steed.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon listened to the low even breathing that told him Jarok was asleep. Slipping out from beneath the boy’s head he covered him with a blanket. Tearing a strip from one of the spare shirts and wetting it thoroughly, Cymon knelt down beside Alyse, very gently washing away the dust of travel from her face. He smoothed down her hair, pulling it round one side in a loose braid, so it wouldn''t be too tangled when she awoke. He lifted a hand, feeling the rough palm as he wiped it with the cloth. No child of her young years should possess such calluses, he thought, surprising himself at the amount of anger in it. Many years he had lived, but she had survived many more than he. On impulse he placed two fingers upon her brow, an elfin gesture of love and respect amongst family and those dear to ones'' heart. He pulled the blanket back up around her and praying that her dreams be joyful, he went outside.</p>\r\n<p>He made his way up to the main track, flushing out a squirrel that darted up the nearest tree. It hung halfway up the trunk, chittering angrily at him for disturbing it’s foraging, then disappeared into the branches. Leaves drifted down slowly in its wake, like coloured snowflakes. Through the thinning canopy he caught a glimpse of clear blue sky. How much longer they would enjoy such weather was uncertain, the evidence of autumn was all around. The leaves were falling, joining other leaves in the thickening, orange and russet carpet beneath his feet. Animals were feeding furiously, to add stores of fat that would enable them to survive the lean times of winter &mdash; flocks of migratory birds hurrying off to warmer climes. The evenings were drawing in. The nights were cold. Even when Alyse awoke (he refused to say ''if'') they would need alternative transport to cover the distance before the bad weather set in. Plus, he would prefer to have Defiant unencumbered... just in case. Defiant’s name had him scanning the forest. Neither the horse nor Royle were anywhere in sight, which he took as a good sign. All was calm and peaceful. As if to confirm this a young doe wandered into sight, browsing unhurriedly from one clump of moss to another. She stopped as she caught sight of him and eyed him warily then, perceiving him to be no threat, she carried on feeding. As he watched her slow, graceful departure from the vicinity his heart suddenly missed a beat. Two yellow eyes blinked at him from amidst the trees.</p>\r\n<p>His weapons were already in his hands before he realised they were too far off the ground to be Citog. He peered closer, breathing a sigh of relief as he identified the owner as an owl. He slipped his weapons back into his belt, taking a deep breath as he kneaded the tension from the back of his neck. They had a long way to go and if he were this edgy now, he would be a nervous wreck before they arrived, he cautioned himself. It was time to stop letting his emotional concern over the welfare of his two charges, interfere with his trained senses. If he did not, they would never survive. He climbed up onto the boulder that marked their camp. From this vantage point, he could see the exact position of the sun and the good news that the forest was thinning out. With luck they may soon encounter a village.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Rohansuk" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Map of Rohansuk" src="Rohansuk01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>"RREOW!" </p>\r\n<p>The unexpected sound coming from so close startled him and he half jumped-half fell, from the rock. He gave himself a mental shake. He was getting very slack indeed, being caught unawares yet again. </p>\r\n<p>"Rreow!" Royle repeated his admonishment, climbing onto Cymon’s lap as he sat.</p>\r\n<p>"I suppose it was pretty stupid of me, putting myself up on show like that. But at least I know for definite we''re heading in the right direction." He scratched the cat behind the ears. "Besides, I knew you were out there taking care of things, Sir Cat!"</p>\r\n<p>A quick stab of claws stung his leg.</p>\r\n<p>"I see you understand my words," grinned Cymon, rubbing at his leg. "Perhaps there''s more to you than meets the eye? Or did you just object to my playful tone? Playful only it was, Sir Royle. I have the utmost respect for your prowess. Sleek and deceptive... you are a deadly fighter. I''ve not forgotten how you saved my life, for which you have my eternal gratitude." He ran his hand over the cats'' head and along its body, sliding it off at the tip of its tail. Royle purred in response. Cymon closed his eyes enjoying, perhaps for the last time in a long while, the warmth of the late summer sun and the feel of soft, silky fur beneath his fingers. He smelt the damp, musty odour of the forest, rising from the decomposing litter upon the ground. Somewhere overhead the squirrel still chittered. Snapping twigs brought them both fully alert. A soft whinny heralded the approach of Defiant before he strode calmly into sight to nuzzle into Cymon’s chest, seeking some of the attention he had just been lavishing on the cat.</p>\r\n<p>"No need to be jealous, old friend," laughed Cymon, getting to his feet and scratching the horses'' neck. "Royle and I are merely cementing our new found friendship. We''re brothers-in-battle now, after all. It is time for a truce. You are included."</p>\r\n<p>To add credence to Cymon’s words, Royle began rubbing himself along Defiant’s leg. The horse pranced sideways, clearly undecided about this, but Royle persisted and eventually Defiant accepted his overtures by dropping his head and blowing gently into Royale’s face. Cymon nodded approval, relieved that the previous animosity between the two animals had at last been put to rest. He rubbed Defiant’s muzzle affectionately.</p>\r\n<p>"Back to work now," he said seriously. "And remember, there''s more than just the two of us now. Give me ample warning if you can." </p>\r\n<p>Defiant snorted and pawed at the ground impatiently in answer.</p>\r\n<p>"I know. I''d rather keep moving too, but Alyse and Jarok aren''t used to travelling and have yet to build up the stamina for it. The boy''s exhausted and Alyse? No!" he said decisively, as Defiant pawed the ground again. "Patrol. Go," he slapped the horse on the rump and turned away, indicating the discussion was at an end. Royle jumped onto Defiant’s back and the two of them trotted off into the trees, the horses'' ears flicking back and forth to the cats'' mewling.</p>\r\n<p>Back on the ledge, Cymon was surprised to find that not only was Jarok awake, but he was brewing some kind of tea. The pleasant aroma tantalised his nostrils as he leaned over the pot.</p>\r\n<p>"Smells good," he gave Jarok a pat on the back. </p>\r\n<p>"I saw it when I was checking on Alyse. The sun caught the tips, or I might never have noticed." Jarok’s face was full of excitement and eager hope as he held up a small triangular leaf, which Cymon took and held up to the sunlight. Silver tips sparkled yet back in the shadow, those same tips were barely noticeable against the dark-green pigment of the rest of the leaf. He studied the waxy coating covering the topside and fine hairs on the paler underside and shook his head; he had definitely never seen it before.</p>\r\n<p>"What plant is this from?" he asked, crushing the leaf between his fingers and releasing the same, sweet smell emanating from the pot.</p>\r\n<p>"Anquas," Jarok told him, removing the pot from the flames to allow the liquid inside to cool.</p>\r\n<p>"Anquas?" Cymon sniffed again at the scent lingering on his fingertips. "I don''t think I''ve ever heard of it."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s very rare," he admitted, part as a statement of fact and part as an excuse for Cymon’s surprising lack of knowledge. "This was a lucky find. There''s one plant that grows just upstream from the cottage but Alyse is the only one who knows it''s there, except for me of course. Alyse uses it to make tea for me when she thinks I''m not eating properly. She says it will help keep my strength up till my appetite comes back. When I saw it, I thought maybe... " </p>\r\n<p>He left the thought unspoken but Cymon had no doubt what the boy was hoping. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, it certainly can''t hurt,” he said cheerfully. "So long as you''re sure it''s the right plant?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok sniffed at the pot and wrinkled his nose.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, I''m sure,” he nodded.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was bewildered by Jarok’s reaction and took another long sniff of the cooled liquid in the bowl the boy passed to him. It still smelt delicious. He shrugged and carried the bowl over to Alyse, carefully spooning a little of the liquid into her mouth, then gently stroking her throat to stimulate swallowing. It was a slow process but he managed to get about half the contents of the bowl into her. What was left over, he divided between Jarok and himself.</p>\r\n<p>"If it''s good enough for Alyse, it''s good enough for us. We''ll need all the strength we can get. Here''s to you. An asset to any company!" Cymon lifted his bowl in a toast and then to his lips.&nbsp;Jarok waited with an amused expression, silently counting. One, two three...&nbsp;Cymon’s face suddenly screwed up in disgust and he quickly spat the liquid onto the ground. </p>\r\n<p>"She makes you drink this stuff?" he spluttered in disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>"I never said it was nice!" Jarok was laughing so hard tears spilled down his cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>"It wasn''t that funny," Cymon glared at him.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, it was," insisted Jarok in delight. "You should''ve seen your face!" He screwed his own into a perfect imitation and soon they were laughing together. </p>\r\n<p>"How can you do that?" Cymon asked after they had calmed down and he watched with a kind of repugnant fascination as Jarok sipped his own portion. </p>\r\n<p>"When you''ve been made to drink as much of it as I have, you get used to it," shrugged Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"The first time''s the worst."</p>\r\n<p>"I guess." Cymon agreed, having absolutely no inclination to test the theory for himself. "What I can''t understand," he mused, puzzling into the appetizing aroma from the bowl, "is how something that smells so good, can taste so... so, revolting!"</p>\r\n<p>"That''s exactly what I said. But Alyse says nothing that''s good for you ever tastes nice."</p>\r\n<p>"Well, in that case," joked Cymon. "This has got to be the best medicine in the world."</p>\r\n<p>With a twinkle in his eyes, Jarok finished the last drops and placed the bowl down slowly then looked up at Cymon with deliberate challenge. Though his taste buds... not to mention his stomach... screamed out against it, Cymon was determined not to be outdone by an eight year old boy so, pretending to hold his nose, he tipped up his bowl and swallowed the lot in one go. Jarok was shaking with suppressed laughter at the shudder that passed through the elfs'' body as the tea passed over his tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok," coughed Cymon from behind his hand, "you must be the bravest boy I know."</p>\r\n<p>This set them both off again and by the time they finished laughing they felt a lot better.</p>\r\n<p>"Strange," remarked Cymon, as they sat quietly afterwards. "I never noticed that plant there before." He stared at it, in plain sight now, growing out at an odd angle from a crevice not far from where Alyse’s head lay.</p>\r\n<p>"That reminds me." Jarok took his knife and carefully removed a piece of root, dropping it into his pouch. "Alyse uses the root too, I think, but I can''t remember what for. It''ll be a nice surprise for her she wakes up, don''t you agree?" </p>\r\n<p>The child he was cried out in the pleading tone of his question, arousing Cymon’s pity and his own sense of helplessness, which he stamped on firmly for all their sakes.</p>\r\n<p>"Absolutely. And I say," he put his arm around Jarok’s shoulders and leaned in to whisper conspiratorially, "that when she wakes up... we make her drink a large mug of ''you know what''!" He winked and gave an inward sigh of relief when Jarok winked back and said they should shake hands on it. "I want you to try and get a bit more sleep now. We''ll be leaving shortly and I don''t know how long it''ll be before we can rest up again."</p>\r\n<p>Wishing he could have allowed him a little longer, Cymon woke Jarok shortly thereafter, leaving him rubbing the sleep from his tired eyes while he went to fetch Defiant, who was more than eager to push on and followed Cymon to be saddled and loaded. To Cymon’s inquiry as to the whereabouts of Royle, Defiant shook his head. Cymon called softly but to no avail. Well, they couldn''t wait around for the cat he would just have to catch up on his own. Wrapping Alyse tightly in a blanket, he lifted her up into Jarok’s arms. Once they cleared the ledge, he handed Jarok the reins and motioned them forward.</p>\r\n<p>"Wait!" Jarok’s voice, though no more than a whisper, sounded loud in the still evening. "We should get some more of the leaves &mdash; only the bottom ones. No more than halfway up the stem," he instructed as Cymon disappeared, tapping his pocket as he returned.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon led the way down the slope at a careful pace, too careful for Defiant’s liking, who kept giving him the occasional nudge in the back to hurry him along. This was not so easy, as the gradient became steeper and the tree roots more exposed and they had to waste time backtracking around obstacles too high or large to risk going over. Twilight was deepened into evening as they approached the forests edge. Unconsciously, Cymon quickened the pace and within moments the forest echoed to his exclamation of pain.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon? Are you alright?" whispered Jarok, trying to locate Cymon in the darkness.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. I just hit my head," Cymon’s voice drifted back. "Be careful of this low branch coming up," he warned, squatting down until the wave of dizziness that washed over him had passed. The glint of metal caught his eye. Using a twig, he carefully brushed away the covering litter.</p>\r\n<p>A gin trap! </p>\r\n<p>One more step and he would have been in trouble. Rather the headache, he thought to himself patting the branch in gratitude.</p>\r\n<p>"Defiant, stop,” he ordered. "There are traps here. Take care and stay close behind me."</p>\r\n<p>Defiant neighed softly, tossing his head. Cymon sprung the trap with the twig, rendering it harmless. Choosing a more substantial probe he set off again very slowly, clearing the way for Defiant to follow. What kind of person used such cruelty? And why were they so many in such a small area? With each snap of the vicious metal jaws, he thought of Royle and hoped the cat was being careful. He wished it would stop running off all the time. As though the annoyed wish was his cue, the elusive Royle suddenly appeared, dropping something at Cymon’s feet. The elf picked it up by the tail, allowing it to swing back and forth for a moment, then tossed it aside.</p>\r\n<p>"Many thanks," he said, "but I''m not that hungry."</p>\r\n<p>Royle retrieved the offering and brought it back with an impatient ''Rreow!''</p>\r\n<p>Cymon picked it back up, eyes narrowing as he peered at it more closely. Royle was obviously trying to tell him something. So what was so special about this mouse? It was nothing that he could see. It looked no different to any other house mouse. He shrugged then slapped his brow as realisation dawned on him. A house mouse!</p>\r\n<p>"Where Royle?" </p>\r\n<p>Royle padded off, not even pausing to see if Cymon was following. Quickly telling Jarok to wait and entrusting the safety of his feet and ankles into Royle’s care, Cymon followed the cat to where the forest ended abruptly onto a roadway. Deep ruts indicated it was well used. On the opposite side, thick brambles climbed over and along a picket fence where a rusty iron gate barred the entrance to a field. Checking it was all clear Cymon crossed the road and squatted down near the gatepost. Now that he had the aid of the moonlight, he could see quite clearly. Several cows were dozing in the field and passed them he spied the farmhouse. Adjacent to the main house was a large barn and stable area. He climbed the gate and crept closer, under the curious gaze of the cows. He was disappointed to discover that what he had mistaken for stables was, in fact, a milking shed. They could not stop here. He made his way silently around to the front of the house, keeping low behind the dry-stone wall. Looking down the hill, he saw lights glowing in the dark. He smiled. If everyone had a light on then it was only a small village, perfect for their needs. Not too many prying eyes but the possibility of supplying all their wants. He made his way back.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok watched Cymon disappear from view with a racing heart. After a while he began counting. One hundred... two... three... surely he should be back by now? </p>\r\n<p>Frightened eyes searched the darkness as his anxious mind filled with awful scenarios. Something bad had happened. Cymon had stepped on one of those traps and was stuck out there, ankle bloody and broken, unable to get free and attacked by the Citog. Dead or dying with no one to help, what if he was lost? Should he go and try to find him? No! Cymon had told him to wait here. He would do as he was told. His nervousness transmitted itself to Defiant who nickered softly in reassurance. </p>\r\n<p>"You''d know if he was in danger, wouldn''t you boy," he asked the horse anxiously.</p>\r\n<p>Defiant shifted his weight to rest one leg in reply. Jarok patted his neck and settled back down to wait. But it was not easy. The longer Cymon stayed away, the more jumpy he became. His head jerked sharply in the direction of every noise. Suddenly he heard a twig snap close by. Drawing himself up taller in the saddle, a small fist clenched around his knife and fear clenched around his heart, he called out into the darkness.</p>\r\n<p>"Take care,” he called, his voice as deep and low as he could make it in the hope he would sound older. "I''m armed and we''re not alone. Show yourself." His heart beat faster as he waited, but nothing moved. Still, he kept the knife poised after that just in case and prayed fervently that Cymon would hurry. The elf emerged, silent as a ghost, from the trees, startling did return it was as silently as he had left, startling Jarok so much, he dropped his knife.</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry." he whispered to the white-faced boy, feeling guilty at having left him alone for so long as well as for scaring him. He picked up the knife and handed it back. "Good news. There''s a village up ahead. With luck, we''ll be able to pick up a wagon which will be make the journey more comfortable for Alyse." He deliberately refrained from adding, ''and yourself''.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s face broke into a smile, his anxieties fading now that Cymon was back and they were again on the move but he was glad when they left the eerie shadows of the trees and stepped onto the road. The road turned out to be long and winding. To reach the village it took longer than Cymon had anticipated. As they approached the final bend, Royle came bounding toward them, tail raised stiff behind him in alarm. Without hesitation Cymon waved them into the hedgerow. </p>\r\n<p>"Get on with you there," a rough voice called as the clip-clop of hooves brought, first the two brown and white shires and then a cart loaded for market, into view. The drivers'' head swung nervously left and right as he passed, flicking the reins and trying to force a faster pace from the plodding horses that totally ignored his efforts. The shire nearside turned its head and looked directly at the hiding group. It snorted loudly and shied into its companion.</p>\r\n<p>"Get on, Samson. Afore I takes the whip to your ''ide," ordered the driver gruffly. </p>\r\n<p>Defiant rolled his eyes as he pawed the ground. Cymon placed a calming hand upon his muzzle.</p>\r\n<p>"Easy," he whispered low in the horses'' ear. "It''s all bluff. They''re well fed and show no fear. He''s a good man for all his words. Besides," he added firmly, "we''ve no time to interfere."</p>\r\n<p>Defiant relaxed, but only slightly, blowing heavily down flared nostrils and keeping a sharp eye on the man until the cart rumbled out of sight. Cymon kept them hidden until Royle signalled the all clear by padding sedately up the centre of the road. The sun was just beginning to rise behind them.</p>\r\n<p>The star-sprinkled black of night gave way to the pale blue of dawn as they entered the village. They heard noises behind closed doors but as yet nobody else was abroad, for which Cymon was thankful as he looked about him. It was a small village, no more than a dozen dwellings built in a circle around a central well. To their right, a large building boasted a colourful, swinging sign proclaiming it to be ''The Wolverine Inn''. Cymon walked over and banged heavily on the solid door. A dog barked somewhere inside and a muffled voice shouted that someone was coming. Another shout to the dog to hold its noise and the door was swung open by a portly man, red faced and sweating from the heat of the kitchen. His hands were covered in flour, his head in a flat cap turned backwards and his apron in numerous stains. Yet for all his dishevelled appearance, his beaming smile denoted a friendly and jovial disposition.</p>\r\n<p>"Good morning to you, Sir. An early traveller to be knocking at my door to be sure," he greeted Cymon pleasantly, then his smile faded as he spied the limp figure of Alyse in Jarok’s arms over Cymon’s shoulder. "Come in, come in," he insisted and immediately hurried out. "Let''s be getting this lass seen to," he said reaching up to take Alyse while Cymon carried Jarok. The innkeeper laid Alyse on the padded bench that ran the length of the wall beneath the windows then flung open the shutters, flooding the room with daylight and fresh air to blow away the smell of stale smoke and ale that still lingered from the previous evening.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you most kindly," said Cymon, sitting Jarok down next to Alyse. "We''ve come a long ways and my sister is exhausted. We''d be obliged to you, if you could furnish us with a room."</p>\r\n<p>"Parlen''s the name," the man held out his hand. "Bartender, Cook and Owner. Place is full just now but if you don''t mind waiting awhile, one gentleman''s travelling on later today."</p>\r\n<p>"We were only intending to stay the morning ourselves," replied Cymon, his lips twisting in disappointment. "Just long enough for a decent meal and to purchase a new wagon. Our own gave up the ghost some time back and the horses made off before I could catch them. We''ve been travelling as you saw ever since."</p>\r\n<p>While Parlen tutted in sympathy, Jarok kept his eyes down to hide their widening amazement at the ease with which these untruths (he didn''t like to say lies) fell from Cymon’s lips. Parlen frowned around the sorry group, gave a hefty sigh then slapped a large hand against his equally large thigh causing a cloud of flour to billow up around him.</p>\r\n<p>"For sure and we can''t just leave the poor mite lying in the bar! She can rest in my room till you''re ready to leave. Follow me." He walked off, through the kitchen that set their stomachs rumbling with the aroma of freshly baked bread and out the other side to a room not much bigger than himself. Sparsely furnished, it contained only the bare necessities; a neatly made bed, small side table and a chest of drawers on which stood a washbasin and jug.</p>\r\n<p>"Help yourself to the water in the jug. Come through when you''re ready, I''ll have breakfast waiting. No need to worry," he assured Cymon’s taut features. "She''ll be perfectly safe here. There''s no way in ''cept past me. And don''t worry about your horse. My boy''ll see to ''im." Then he was gone, to bang pots and pans in the kitchen. </p>\r\n<p>When Cymon and Jarok joined him, three places were set with a hearty meal of eggs, mushrooms and potato cakes. A loaf of still warm bread was sliced ready beside a pot of butter and a half-round of cheese.</p>\r\n<p>"Tuck in," instructed Parlen, pulling out one of the chairs for himself. "I hope you won''t mind me joining you? Haven''t eaten myself yet. BARLEY!&nbsp;What''s keeping you boy?" His booming voice left their ears ringing so they never heard the footsteps of Barley, a youngster with obvious family connections, as he hurried in from the bar carrying three mugs. He poured a little water into each and then the hot poker from the stove.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing like a hot toddy to warm the blood when you''ve been travelling all night." Parlen lifted his mug to them before taking a noisy slurp, wiping his mouth on the corner of his apron. Jarok looked first at Cymon, who nodded, before lifting his own mug.</p>\r\n<p>"So, you''ll be looking to buy a new wagon and pair? The old cheat will charge you an arm and a leg, especially when he knows how bad you need it...&nbsp;and he will. I know what you''re going to say," he went on quickly before Cymon could empty the words from his open mouth. "You didn''t see a soul on the way in. But rest assured, the whole place will be knowing you''re here before you''re finished eating."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon could not stop the look of consternation that crossed his face; he had been hoping to get in and out without attention; any more than Parlen could avoid noticing it. The innkeeper finished his breakfast in silence, giving Cymon time to digest what was obviously unwelcome news. As he ate, Parlen observed Cymon’s surreptitious fingering of the coins in his pocket. He saw him look at the boy, who shook his head, and the frown that crossed Cymon’s brow and could not help feeling pity for them. They really were not having a very good day!</p>\r\n<p>"As it happens," Parlens'' tone gave no indication that he had noticed any of their exchange. "I''m in possession of a rig that I might willing to sell... for a fair price."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon pulled the coins from his pocket and counted them under the table. Half a gold piece and two coppers. Even the most broken-down wagon would cost more than that! With a disappointed shrug he began to put them away but Parlen grabbed his wrist, tipped the coins on the table and slapped his palm over them.</p>\r\n<p>"Done,” he announced.</p>\r\n<p>"But... " Cymon began to argue.</p>\r\n<p>"And you''ll be doing me a favour right enough. Blasted thing... Pardon my language," he apologised with a quick glance at Jarok, "the thing''s costing me a fortune in stable bills. Besides," he winked deliberately, "can''t have your ''sister'' suffer any more than is necessary." He leaned back, grinning at the mixed looks of surprise and confusion that passed between man and boy. "Whatever else they may appear, an Elf is an Elf to a knowing ear,” he sang in a rich, amused voice and winked again, this time at a gaping Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"How?" Asked Cymon, lifting his own jaw back up from chest. Parlen slapped him heartily on the back, then held out his arm and flexed still-firm muscles.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve had some dealings with your people in my previous occupation," he explained. "In fact, I owe my life to an elf and I swore to him then that I''d help any of his people whenever it was needed. For sure and I get the impression it''s sorely needed."</p>\r\n<p>"Indeed it is. We...&nbsp;I...&nbsp;can''t thank you enough." Cymon smiled in broad relief and shook his hand warmly. Parlen turned to Jarok, who had been listening with avid fascination.</p>\r\n<p>"Always keep your ears open my lad. You can learn a lot about a person from their voice," he patted Jaroks hand as he rose. " Well now, and if you''ve finished eating, we''ll go and get this rig sorted and see about getting you on your way."&nbsp;He called to Barley to tell the other guests that it was bread and cheese for breakfast, take it or leave it, and strode off, leaving Cymon to follow and bemused Barley standing open-mouthed in the middle of the empty room. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon and Parlen pulled many a curious glance on their way to the stables but </p>\r\n<p>Parlen waved off any questions, restricting all communication to ''Good morning!'' and ''Lovely day again!'' A miserable looking man with features resembling a weasel met them at the paddock gate.</p>\r\n<p>"Come to get them old nags, ''ave you?" he demanded tersely, curious eyes fixed quite blatantly on Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"Exactly! So you''ll be getting no more of my jangles, you old money-grubber."</p>\r\n<p>"Pph! Can''t jangle an empty purse," replied the grumpy voice. </p>\r\n<p>"And isn''t it the likes of you as empties it for me?" retorted Parlen.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s the soft hole in your head more like," muttered the man with a narrowed glance at Cymon. "Well, there they are yonder," he pointed to two roans on the other side of the field. "You''ll get no help from me roundin’ em up. And see you shut the gate after you,” he snapped over his shoulder as he stomped off. Parlen waited until the man had gone before placing two fingers between his lips and giving a shrill whistle. Immediately the matching pair of roans trotted across the paddock and put their heads over the gate, nuzzling his hand for a titbit.</p>\r\n<p>"And wouldn''t Frane be furious if he knew?" He rewarded each horse with half an apple and a scratch on the forehead, and then turned to Cymon with an amused glint in his eye. "Times I''ve watched him chase this pair round this field,” he laughed, opening the gate. The roans were quite happy to follow him back to the yard and stood quietly while he and Cymon fixed them in their traces. Along with their own meagre possessions, Parlen added a spare mattress for Alyse and a well-stocked basket of food. Once he had secured the canvas top over the wagon, Cymon fetched Alyse and settled her inside, by which time Jarok had returned with Defiant and Barley had finished filling the water barrel strapped to the wagons'' side. To his annoyance, also by this time, the entire village had suddenly found itself in desperate need for water and a noisy crowd had assembled about the well to watch their departure. Parlen’s face held a look of patient inevitability and ''I told you so''.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll be havin'' to forgive them," he said softly. "There''s little enough entertainment and for sure they’re good people at heart and mean no harm by it."</p>\r\n<p>"And they have a good friend," answered Cymon, clasping Parlens'' hand warmly in a final goodbye. "As do we," he added sincerely. He took up the reins but did not immediately set off and after a thoughtful pause turned serious eyes to Parlen.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t explain but there may be danger ahead. Grave danger." He cast his eyes quickly over the crowd. "Take care, Parlen."</p>\r\n<p>"Always do," Parlen tapped the side of his nose.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon clucked the pair forward, giving the crowd a friendly smile as he passed. Jarok trotted behind on Defiant while Royle, deciding he had a busy enough day, curled up on the mattress beside Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Hey!"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon pulled to a halt as Parlens'' voice boomed over the noise of the crowd. He glanced around the side of the wagon to where Parlen had been joined by Frane and a group of others. He grimaced. No doubt Parlen was already getting grilled for information. </p>\r\n<p>"And don''t you be forgetting to bring the rest of that money back with you. Two weeks, you said. I never forget a face, mark you, and for sure I''ll be watching."</p>\r\n<p>Silence fell as the villagers waited to hear the strangers'' reply.</p>\r\n<p>"You keep watching," Cymon called in reply. "If I can''t get back myself I''ll surely send someone," Cymon returned Parlens'' wave as he called back, the double meaning clear only to the two of them. He slapped the reins and the wagon lurched forward out of the village.</p>\r\n<p>The two roans obviously enjoyed their work. Heads up, ears pricked, they pulled the wagon at a fast trot with ease, covering a great distance in a short space of time. Though they had yet to meet any other travellers that morning, the hard-packed surface suggested that this road was well traversed. Cymon was slightly anxious about this but, in such a hilly region, he had little option but to stick to the road as long as they had the wagon. And they had to have the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>Winding its way through the hills the road was protected on one side by steep, grassy slopes and on the other, by a drop-off that afforded a panorama of the surrounding countryside. They had left the cultivated fields of the village far behind and all before them was Natures'' land. It was peaceful and unspoilt by human encroachment, except for the road which having been worn according to the natural contours of the land, was barely noticeable other than as a grey line dividing the green expanse. The whole area was vibrant and fertile and Cymon had a fleeting wish to be crossing it in high summer, to experience its full glory. Yet even in its waning youth its beauty was breathtaking. Down in the valleys there were still a few splashes of colour from the hardier plants that held on into the autumn, refusing to join the majority already wilting into winter sleep to await re-birth in the spring. Sunlight sparkled off the waters of a swiftly running stream as it chased its way over a rocky bed, like a diamond necklace draped across the shoulders of the Earth. Treading cautiously along the streams'' wide, shingle bank, a herd of deer dipped their heads to drink then lifted them again to listen to the loud, bellowing roar that filled the air. Amidst the purple and white heathers above, a magnificent stag stood calling his intentions. Moments later an answering call was heard and the hills reverberated with the sounds of repeated, deep-throated cries as the two males estimated the ability and strength of each other. Suddenly the stag above them swung away and they heard the clacking and crashing as the two rivals locked antlers.</p>\r\n<p>For Jarok it was a wonderland of hitherto un-experienced sights and sounds which, now he no longer had the task of holding on to Alyse, he could sit back and enjoy. He looked up, just in time to see a hovering kestrel mark its prey and drop, like a stone, to the ground. So preoccupied was he in the graceful flight of the swooping bird, he was caught unawares when Defiant suddenly went down, throwing him from the saddle. Cymon had already leapt down from the wagon and, catching his rolling figure, dragged him beneath it then pointed skyward. A grey, menacing shape was now circling the spot that the kestrel had occupied only moments before.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" whispered Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not sure, but it''s not a bird. It looks more like a bat but I swear it''s got arms," he added as the creature circled lower. Motioning Jarok to lay still, Cymon covered himself with the likeness of a wizened old man and slipped out into the open. Grey of hair and beard and bent almost double with age, he tottered round to the front of the wagon. He kicked at the wheel, then knelt down beside it and placed his hands near the axle. A raucous cry filled the air with a gagging stench. Cymon looked up and, shielding his eyes, stared directly at the harpy. It circled once more, and then flew off. Cymon stared after it with an uneasy fluttering in his stomach and only when he was certain it was gone did he call Jarok out from his hiding place.</p>\r\n<p>"Phew,” exclaimed Jarok, waving a hand under his nose. "I hope that doesn''t come by this way too often."</p>\r\n<p>"My sentiments exactly," agreed Cymon, though for different reasons.</p>\r\n<p>"How did you know it wasn''t just a bird?" asked Jarok curiously. "It was too high up to see clearly then."</p>\r\n<p>"Just a feeling. Something just didn''t feel right, in here." Cymon explained, tapping his chest, when Jarok gave him a puzzled look. Lesson number two in Warriorship, my lad," he cautioned seriously. "Never discount a feeling...&nbsp;it could save your life." Cymon stood with his hand on Jarok’s shoulder, an anxious frown troubling his brow, as they both re-scanned the skies after the harpy. The foul stench and grotesque form of the creature violated Cymon’s senses. Such vileness could only be a servant of Duman, just as the Citog were. His keen eyes dropped to the surrounding countryside seeking any sign of the bearers of the name. Where were they? </p>\r\n<p>''Perhaps,'' said a small voice inside, ''if Duman has need to send reinforcements, it means somehow we have shaken the pack off our trail.'' Though Cymon would have liked to believe this, he knew it was highly unlikely. Unconsciously, he shook his head. No. They were out there somewhere and with that ''thing'' to scout for them, their job had just gotten a whole lot easier. This was definitely not good. Now he must watch the skies, as well as their backs. He felt Defiant’s breath on his cheek and lifted his hand to stroke the horses'' muzzle. A deep sigh escaped him as he changed back into his usual appearance. Jarok’s worried face looked up at him as he turned to climb back onto the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>"How about driving for a while?" he suggested, knowing that the excitement of doing something new would chase away the boys'' troubled mood.</p>\r\n<p>"Can I really?" asked Jarok, rushing off to climb onto seat and pick up the reins without waiting for Cymon to answer.</p>\r\n<p>"Just let me unsaddle Defiant first."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon took a moment to check on Alyse as he stowed the saddle in the wagon. She remained unchanged. Royle opened a lazy eye, glared at him for disturbing his sleep and promptly shut it again. Joining Jarok up front, he showed him the correct way to hold the reins and how to give the horses a gentle slap to set them going. Jarok was tense with concentration as the wagon jerked forward. Cymon tapped his hands and told him to relax.</p>\r\n<p>"They''re willing workers, needing little urging, just guidance. Keep it gentle but firm, just as you do on Defiant," he said encouragingly. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok nodded and loosened his grip, allowing the two horses freedom to work and grinned in delight as the wagon rolled smoothly forward.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s it! You''ve got it. Now ease back gently," Cymon instructed, when the two roans began to pull for their heads and pick up speed. "Not too hard and don''t jerk. Keep it a slow pressure, just to let them know who is boss. They recognise a new hand and are testing," he shook his head, refusing to take over when Jarok said he did not think he could do it. "They tried it with me when we first set out." It was only a small lie and worth it to see the pleasure on Jarok’s face as his restored confidence transmitted itself down the reins and the roans conceded to his authority and slowed to a steady walk. "There you go," Cymon slapped him on the back, "a natural born wagon driver, if ever I saw one!" Jarok flushed pink with delight, wriggling self-consciously under the praise. Before long though he was leant forward, elbows resting casually on his knees and looking all of what Cymon had called him.</p>\r\n<p>Defiant had galloped off ahead as soon as he was unsaddled and now stood waiting for them beneath the spreading branches of a large, sweet chestnut tree. It was still well enough in leaf to grant them reasonable cover from above, as well as providing a small crop of nuts below. Cymon took a quick look around as Jarok steered the wagon beneath the tree. From here the land ran flat for a distance and the road straightened out before it began its ascent over the next set of hills, affording a clear view of anything coming or going.</p>\r\n<p>"Seems as good a spot as any for a break," he said, satisfied they would not be crept up on.</p>\r\n<p>Their first task was to brew a small pot of ''Anquas'' for Alyse. Jarok studied his sisters'' face while he held her head for Cymon to spoon the liquid into her mouth. Though still very pale she seemed to him, no longer the deathly white of previous days and her lips had a definite pinkish hue. He picked up her hand and pressed it to his cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"She looks better, don''t you think?" he asked Cymon in a bright voice. "She feels warmer too." He lifted Alyse’s hand to Cymon’s cheek. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon smiled and nodded. She did appear to be less cold than before. They grinned at each other with rising hope and returned with renewed enthusiasm to coaxing her to drink a little more of the brew. The wagon rocked as they jumped down and Alyse emitted a tiny moan. They stood, side by side at the tailgate, praying for more. But it was not to be. Alyse sank back into silence. Disheartened, they turned away... and yet, it was better than nothing. So said their hope. A sign perhaps, that she was at last becoming aware again of the outside world.</p>\r\n<p>Leaning against one of the wagon wheels, they ate a simple meal of bread and cheese. Cymon grimaced (much to Jarok’s amusement) every time the boy sipped at the mug of leftover tea, which he had respectfully declined to share in favour of nice cold water. As they relaxed for a while afterwards, Jarok began to fidget. Cymon waited expectantly, knowing this to be a sure sign that Jarok had a question brewing. Sure enough he felt a prod on his arm.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon, are you asleep? May I ask a question?" Jarok added when Cymon opened his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s sort of personal though," Jarok hesitated.</p>\r\n<p>"Fire away,” replied Cymon. "We''re past having secrets, I think."</p>\r\n<p>"Well, it''s about last night. You know? When you walked into that low branch?"</p>\r\n<p>"Not something I''d recommend,” joked Cymon, though he had been wondering about that himself. The thing had seemed to spring out of nowhere.</p>\r\n<p>"Well...&nbsp;" Jarok hesitated again, then blurted out. "I thought elves were supposed to have ''super sight'', or something like that?"</p>\r\n<p>"Elfin... not elves," Cymon corrected him, but not unkindly. "And you''re talking about Night Vision I take it?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. It''s just that, well, in all the stories you told me... " Jarok’s voice tailed off in surprise at the guilty expression that flushed Cymon’s face.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll let you into a secret. But you must promise never to tell," he wagged a finger under Jarok’s nose then made a big show of looking all around him. Jarok was not quite sure if he was joking or not, so he nodded vigorously and crossed his heart in solemn promise.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s true," Cymon began quietly, "that elfin vision is, as a rule, superior to that of other races. However, the notion of ''Night Vision'' has been somewhat exaggerated. First labelled upon us during the Hurian Wars, we encouraged the idea because it gave us a distinction over others and to our shame I must admit we enjoyed it. We too, have our faults you see. Pride is perhaps our greatest failing. Anyway, the truth is that there were then, as there are now, a select few that truly did possess this gift. But it''s a gift to the few, not the all," he broke off at the spreading disappointment on Jarok’s face. "Perhaps I shouldn''t have... exaggerated so in my stories," he gave a wry smile. "But then that''s the art of a good storyteller and some habits are hard to break," he admitted. </p>\r\n<p>Whether he was talking about the habit of storytelling or exaggeration, Jarok was unclear, but he accepted the apology as for both and smiled. Cymon winked at him and rubbed the bruise on his brow. </p>\r\n<p>"Besides, even night vision is useless if you''re not looking where you''re going &mdash; lesson number three."</p>\r\n<p>They were still laughing when the three horsemen came into sight. Cymon quickly spread the appropriate illusions for the story he prepared then settled back to wait, outwardly relaxed and smiling reassuringly to Jarok as the men reined in and dismounted. Jarok tried to remain as calm as Cymon appeared to be but it wasn''t easy. He did not like the looks of this group. They looked mean, with greedy expectancy in their faces. He forced his eyes to stay away from the wagon where Alyse lay helpless, keeping them instead on the horses. Pity for their plight fired an uncharacteristic, swelling anger in his heart. They were emaciated. Angled bones pushing through paper-thin skin and hardly seeming to have the strength to stand themselves, let alone carry anyone else. From muzzle to rump they bore the scars of whips and the frequent rough handling that was reflected in their dejected stance of broken-spirited fatalism. They expected nothing from life except pain and wanted nothing from it except death. He glanced over at Defiant, with his flaring nostrils and rolling eyes. So proud and alive! </p>\r\n<p>''Never discount a feeling, it could save your life,'' Cymon’s words echoed softly in his mind. Without realising exactly what he was doing, he slipped his knife from the strap on his arm. He was not even aware of moving at all until he felt the pressure of Cymon’s hand on his shoulder. He slipped hand and knife into his pocket.</p>\r\n<p>"Afternoon to ''e, fine sirs." </p>\r\n<p>It was the oldest of the group that spoke. His greasy, black hair and food-specked beard were streaked with grey and his insincere smile pulled back thin lips to reveal discoloured teeth. Shifty eyes jumped like the resident fleas in his torn and filthy clothing... if his continuous scratching was anything to go by! The two men at his side were younger versions of himself.</p>\r\n<p>"Sons’n me ''eard you wuz atravellin'' this way, back in yonder village," he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder. "Thought as maybe you''d be likin'' a bit o'' comp''ny like. Dangerous bizness...&nbsp;atravellin’ alone these days."</p>\r\n<p>His two sons sniggered at each other until their fathers'' elbows subdued them. Cymon kept his expression even, his voice polite and his movements casual as he began collected together their belongings.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you kindly, but we''re not travelling far and are content alone, setting our own pace."</p>\r\n<p>"An'' a fine pace it is too," remarked the man, his tone tinged with anger which he tried to mask by giving them another smile. "Took us a fair while to catch up wiv ''e. Old nags is almost done in. Your''n... iffin I might be so bold to say... are a fine set o'' beasts an'' no mistakin''," he ran a covetous eye over the two roans even as he reached out to Defiant and almost lost his fingers for the trouble. "Feisty, too,” he barked with false laughter, his hand curling into a fist as narrowed eyes gave Defiant a glare of promised retribution. Defiant snorted his disdain at the threat, incensing the man further... but it was the man who dropped his eyes first. Cymon smiled inwardly. The man was no match for his friend.</p>\r\n<p>"They suffice," Cymon replied casually.</p>\r\n<p>When the man squatted beside the small pile of belongings and began poking through them, Cymon noted the suspiciously sword-like bulge beneath his coat. He glanced surreptitiously at the two sons. As far as he could tell, they carried only the knives in their belts. Unhurriedly, he reclaimed their things from beneath the man’s hand and, nudging Jarok, moved to the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>"Wot be ''e acarryin'' in there then?" demanded one of the sons, following Cymon to the tailboard.</p>\r\n<p>"Raith,” his father called in mock reprimand. "Wot ''ave I told you ''bout bein'' so nosy? ''Scuse ''is ways, sir. Few pieces missin'', so t'' speak," he apologised tapping his temple. </p>\r\n<p>"No harm done," Cymon smiled politely and began stowing his load. "It''s no secret. It is just my ailing Grandmother. We''re bringing her to be with the family when she meets the Reaper." He felt the hot, foul breath of Raith on his neck as the man leaned over him to look in the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t look t'' me like she''s gonna make it," he laughed maliciously. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon turned sharply and shot him a look of pure disgust as he dropped the cover and brushed past him.</p>\r\n<p>"Well," he nodded politely to the father as he passed him, "as your son so delicately pointed out, time is of the essence. So, we must be on our way. Up you get, son." He lifted Jarok onto the seat and climbed up beside him.</p>\r\n<p>"Surely, ''e can spare a while t'' chat wiv friends?" </p>\r\n<p>"I''m afraid not. Good day, sirs." </p>\r\n<p>As Cymon went to pick up the reins, the second son, who had been quietly moving closer to the team, grabbed the bridle of the nearest. The father drew his sword.</p>\r\n<p>"I insist! Tain''t neighb''ly t'' just take off." He brandished the sword menacingly and ordered Raith to take charge of the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>Out of view of the three men, Jarok had slipped his knife from his pocket and now held it flat against his thigh. As Raith reached up to lift him down, Jarok slashed outward, cutting a deep gash across the Man’s nose. Raith fell backwards with a cry, holding his face.</p>\r\n<p>Seizing his chance Defiant plunged into the men’s horses and seizing theirs, the horses took off, knocking over the second son who released his grip as he fell. Cymon gave the roans a sharp slap and they jumped into a canter.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t just lay there, you ''alfwit. Stop ''em,” the father screamed. </p>\r\n<p>The second son jumped up, pulled out his knife and drew back his arm to throw it at the fleeing wagon. At which point the hitherto unnoticed Royle, leapt out of the braches of the tree and sank his teeth into the base of the Man’s thumb. The knife dropped harmlessly to the ground. Even before it landed, Royle was again secreted high up in the tree, lying flat and out of sight while his victim stood stupidly, staring at the blood running down his arm and wondering what had happened. The father looked at his sons in despair and then at his fast disappearing opportunity and even faster disappearing horses. They never moved like that when he wanted them to! He flung his sword to the ground in angry frustration, shouting curses at them all.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon kept the team at a canter until Defiant returned from the rear and he knew they were not being followed. As usual, he had no idea where Royle was. The cat had not been in the wagon when Cymon had pulled down the cover but he was not worried, he knew Royle would find them again when he was ready. He turned to congratulate Jarok on his quick thinking but the words died on his lips at the sight of the hunched figure staring numbly at the knife in his hands. The blade was stained red with blood whose wetness mingled with that of the boys'' tears. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok was aghast at what he had done. For the first time in his life he had deliberately injured somebody. It was all so different from his fantasies. In those, the battles were bloodless...&nbsp;painless. Nobody was ever really hurt and they all lived happily ever after. Comparing this to the reality he had just experienced; the Man’s cry of pain, the sight of open flesh, the spurting blood; he began to shake with shock at the enormity of his actions and the terrible realisation that this tiny act could be as nothing, compared to what he might be called upon to do before they reached safety. If this was a warriors'' life, he thought bitterly, then he wanted no part of it!</p>\r\n<p>"Good,” replied Cymon, reaching into the back for a blanket to throw around the boy’s shoulders. Jarok jumped. He had not realised he had said the thought aloud. "Then you''re already halfway there to becoming a good one."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok gazed back at Cymon blankly. The elfs'' words made no sense to him at all. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon pulled him close into the comforting circle of his arm, pushing his hair back from his forehead and wiping his eyes on the corner of the blanket.</p>\r\n<p>"You did what you had to do, Jarok. What was necessary... for our escape and to protect Alyse. More importantly, you did only as much as was necessary and no more. This is the mark of a good warrior."</p>\r\n<p>"What''s the difference?" sniffed Jarok. "I still hurt that man and caused him pain."</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll tell you," sighed Cymon patiently. "It would''ve been easy for us to have killed those three. Defiant and I could''ve dropped them before they left their saddles. But that would have made us murderers, not warriors. Understand?" Cymon rubbed his chin, furrowed brow searching for the right words when Jarok shook his head and said he did not. He tried again. "You don''t kill someone for their appearance alone. Appearances can be deceptive," his cloak wavered in and out to make his point. "First you have to uncover their intent. The intent of those men was obvious and if taking their lives had been our only option for safety, then it I''m afraid it would''ve had to be done. But it wasn''t. There was another option: one that allowed us to escape with minimal injury to anyone. That''s the one we took. The lesser option." He lifted Jarok’s chin and smiled at him. "Believe me, it looked a lot worse than it actually was. His nose may be somewhat smaller than before but maybe it''ll enhance his looks,” he quipped, but his feeble attempt to lighten the boys'' mood failed. Jarok was not to be cheered. </p>\r\n<p>Though he now understood what Cymon was telling him, it did not make what he had done any easier for him to accept, but he had sworn to himself that he would do whatever he must to protect Alyse and he had been called upon to honoured that oath. Now it was time to grow up and stop snivelling like a baby. What was done was done and deep down he knew he would do it again. He did not have to like it but he would do it. So with one last sniff for passing boyhood, he wiped his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"I still don''t think I''ll enjoy being a warrior," he stated miserably, more to himself than to Cymon who carefully hid his smile at the boys'' change of heart.</p>\r\n<p>"If you always retain that feeling then you''ll be one of the best. It''s when you begin to enjoy the taking of life; and believe me, there are some that do; that you are lost and will no longer seek the lesser option. All life is precious Jarok. Remember that and preserve it... where you can... and you''ll always have the knowledge that what you did was the final act, after all else failed. This is what enables you to carry the consequences of your actions without guilt. Regret, but not guilt," he finished in a sorrowful tone. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok swivelled round and looked down at the defenceless form of the sleeping Alyse. He shuddered at the thought of those men hurting her, though his naive young mind had no conception of the true horrors that could have been inflicted upon her. Cymon was right, he agreed looking back at the knife. Those men had given them no choice. But no matter how many like them he encountered, or whatever else their journey had in store, he would always remember Cymon’s words and seek the lesser option. Having ordered his thoughts, he began to slip his knife away with a lighter heart. Cymon grabbed his wrist, shaking his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Clean the blade first or it will rust," he instructed, tossing him a piece of rag from under the seat. Jarok did as he was told; even spitting on the rag in order to remove the dried, stubborn stains. Though his voice still retained some of that boyish, whimsical quality, when he spoke again it was with steadfast resolution and stoic maturity.</p>\r\n<p>"Should I count this as lesson number four," he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok... you''ve gone far beyond lesson four. You''ve already learnt the final and most important lesson of all." Cymon’s tone was serious behind his wide smile. </p>\r\n<p>"Does that mean I''m now a warrior?"</p>\r\n<p>The roans looked back with impatience at being pulled to halt again so soon. Cymon laid the reins across his lap and turned in his seat. </p>\r\n<p>"Maybe you have a few things more to learn, here...&nbsp;and here," he squeezed Jarok’s hand and tapped his head respectively, then placed his palm over the boys heart. "But here, you''ve already passed the ultimate test. So I would say that yes... where it matters most, you are a true warrior," and to prove it he, clasped Jarok’s arm, hand to elbow, in a gesture of salute.</p>\r\n<p>"I welcome you into the Brotherhood. Friend and Warrior!"</p>\r\n<p>"I won''t let you down," promised Jarok, his chin raised proudly as he returned the salute along with a beaming grin.</p>\r\n<p>They made camp that night just inside a wooded area that gave them some protection from the chill wind that had arisen and concealed them from prying eyes. Jarok was worried that there was still no sign of Royle and Cymon had to pretend to put him on guard duty over Alyse, to stop the boy from going off to look for him. When he checked on them later Jarok was fast asleep next to Alyse, one hand clasping his pouch, the other gripped tightly about the hilt of his knife. He covered the boy with a blanket, pulled down the canvas flap to still the draught and returned to his watch, to pass his own night in thoughtful contemplation. </p>\r\n<p>They had passed quite a few travellers on the road that afternoon, telling them to watch out for the three rogues and learning in return, that the road ahead was clear and safe and would take them all the way to Soul-stealer Lake. It would be a long haul skirting the lake before they could turn westward again. Cymon was annoyed at himself for having drifted so far south. How could he have so miscalculated their direction, he wondered, staring up into the night sky. The stars glittered, like chips of ice in black liquid. He shivered and pulled up the collar of jacket. Defiant appeared at his side and he leaned against the warmth of the horse, slipping his hand under his mane to rub his neck.</p>\r\n<p>"All clear?"</p>\r\n<p>Defiant tossed his head, then snorted, pawing the ground with his right hoof.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t like it either," agreed Cymon. "Where are they?"</p>\r\n<p>He had been asking himself this question over and over, having convinced himself that the harpy was a scout but unable to do the same as to whether or not he had deceived it. Even with their head start, he had fully expected the Citog to have caught up by now, or at least to hear something in the distance. So again, where were they? Suddenly the answer seemed clear. The reason the Citog were not chasing them was because they were already ahead! Somehow, they knew where he was headed and were lying in wait on the trail. </p>\r\n<p>Suppose the harpy had not searching, but checking on their progress? Yet how could they know? Who would tell them? He puzzled over these new questions as he watched Defiant trot back off into the night while the moon weaved her way through the stars. Unlike the moon, which managed to steer a clear course through the silvery maze, Cymon always came up to the same dead-end. The Elders.</p>\r\n<p>The undeniable fact raised unthinkable conclusions, against which he argued vehemently with himself. Apart from himself (and Jarok and Alyse, of course) they were the only ones who knew. Yet it was impossible that the Elders should be in league with the enemy. </p>\r\n<p>Why then would they send him on this mission, unless it wasn''t all of them? </p>\r\n<p>The path of his thoughts began to narrow. </p>\r\n<p>Unless it was only one! </p>\r\n<p>Cymon was loath to believe there might be a traitor amongst the leaders of his race but the longer he thought on it, the more logic pointed to this conclusion. </p>\r\n<p>But who was the traitor?</p>\r\n<p>He thought back to the meeting in the Oaken Chamber. It had been Mailon the Superior, who had done all the talking. Mailon’s voice he and the other volunteers had heard as the oak door opened to admit them. Mailon, whose hawkish gaze had raked the other Elders present and kept them firmly in the background so that they had said nothing apart from asking the volunteers what they knew of the ''Ballad of Duman''. It had been Mailon who had chosen Cymon and dismissed the rest, Mailon who had instructed him as to the mission, Mailon who had over-ridden all his attempts at question, Mailon who had warned him that nothing was to leave the room about where and why he was leaving. What could he tell? He knew nothing! Only bare orders and location. Why had he accepted such vagueness? Because of his arrogance, that''s why, he forced himself to admit and dropped his head in his hands as he remembered how easily </p>\r\n<p>Mailon had preyed upon his pride.</p>\r\n<p>"Top of the class. Excelled in all lessons. Greatest confidence in your ability."</p>\r\n<p>Such praise had come thick and fast. Oh, yes! Mailon had baited the hook well... and he had swallowed it whole. Now it could cost all of them their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Stupid! Stupid young fool! He berated himself, dropping to ground when his legs suddenly refused to support him. How Mailon must have laughed at him, all puffed up with his own importance! He was nowhere near ready for such as this. He knew it during the near disastrous encounter with the Citog. Had known it back in Phelise, if truth were told, when he had deliberately ignored the uncomfortable atmosphere in the chamber and the nervous faces that avoided looking at him. But then, none of the volunteers would have been ready, so he recalled. True, they were all of the warrior tribe but, like himself, none were fully-fledged members of the Elite. At only just over 400 years old, he had not quite finished his training and was untried and inexperienced. A fact already born out in that an Elite would have known the ineffectiveness of the spindle dart against Citog. None of the volunteers had even been out of Phelise before, except himself. And only then when he had sneaked out to rescue Defiant and that could hardly be counted! </p>\r\n<p>His face softened as he forgot his worries for a moment to re-live that episode in his life. Carrying the young colt to safety across his shoulders. Sitting, night and day, praying for him to pull through and watching him grow when he did. His teeth shone in the moonlight as he grinned. Mailon had made him stand guard duty every day for six months after that, for leaving the gate open and unattended.</p>\r\n<p>Mailon’s name brought back his dark and unwanted conclusions and his face hardened again. He must be wrong. He must be! Yet he couldn''t help but recall how Mailon had ridden roughshod over the proceedings and everyone present, with an air of secrecy (or so Cymon’s agitation now remembered it) that far exceeded the seriousness of the mission. But why bother going through all the pretence of a rescue mission at all? Because the other Elders had proposed it and he would have given himself away if he had refused?&nbsp;But if it were so obvious to himself that Mailon had set him up to fail then why did the others Elders not see it also, they were surely far more astute than he? What could Mailon have said to them behind closed doors in order to convince them to send ''fledglings'' without revealing his intention for failure and thus, implicating himself in treachery? What kind of hold could Mailon have over them all? Some evil sorcery supplied by Duman for his services? But why would Mailon need this, he was already the ''Superior''? What could he possibly gain that he did not already possess?</p>\r\n<p>What? Why? When? Who? How?</p>\r\n<p>All his thoughts began thus and ended without answers, so that all he was left with was a throbbing head and an aching heart. He breathed deeply of the cold night air. </p>\r\n<p>The answers were in Phelise, more specifically, with Mailon. He drew himself up with new purpose. He would confound Mailon’s plans. They would make it back he decided, and when they did... he would confront Mailon with his suspicions! This time, he would not be fobbed off with half-formed vagueness and deceiving flattery. He would reveal Mailon, not only to the Elders but all Elfin, for what he was... a traitor! </p>\r\n<p>He felt his spirit die a little as he uttered the word but resolved not to turn away from his duty, however painful. The Elfin race had already supplied the world with one traitor; he would not allow it to do so again. Even though he had resolved this purpose, still the muddled thoughts refused to go away. Round and round they tumbled in his mind, becoming more jumbled with every trip.</p>\r\n<p>“ENOUGH,” he finally shouted aloud. </p>\r\n<p>This constant questioning was only distracting him and the Mother knew that was the last thing he needed right now. He needed to focus on the job in hand. He focused on tomorrow, deliberating about abandoning the west gate altogether and making instead for the northern gate in the Borinian Heights. Yet even as the idea formed he realised how impractical it was. It would mean wasting time retracing their steps almost to Parlen’s village. Summer was already dying and the mountains already thick with ice and snow. The gateway was situated at high altitude where conditions would be at their worst. Alyse and Jarok would never make it. Besides, he heaved a sigh; if Duman knew they were heading for Phelise (and it would seem he did) then he would have all the gateways covered anyway. In which case, his best course was to head for the nearest. With speed, in case the Citog were behind and caution, in case they were before. Until he knew which it was all he could do.</p>\r\n<p>“May the Mother help us,” he prayed fervently, but the blinking stars disappearing one by one behind the gathering clouds did not bode well for an auspicious answer. </p>\r\n', 1, 19, 11, 4, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(17, 'I spy with my little harpy', 'CHAPTER FIVE', '<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="I" src="I.gif">t might have lightened Cymon’s mood a little, to know how much time the Citog had wasted on the false trails he had laid before picking up the true one. With the fate of their demised pack-mates still fresh in their limited minds, they had wasted even more time by following the trail only as far the village before returning to the ledge (where Cymon and company had camped and the scent was strongest) to await Hogeth and further orders. And it was here, milling about impatiently, that the pack-master caught up with them after he left Ak''thai. <p></p>\r\n<p>The Citog were pleased by his return, which meant a resumption of the hunt, but they were far from happy to see the fresh pack that came with him and they snarled their resentment. Hogeth raised his whip. Empowered with energy to inflict various degrees of pain and injury through to death, it was an effective means of control and a lethal weapon. Both packs backed off but it was evident, in their stiff legs and lowered heads, that there was going be trouble eventually. So the arrival of the harpy, just as Hogeth was about to set them running, did nothing to sweeten his temper... even less, its intention to stay. Trying to integrate the two packs into one working group was going to be difficult enough, without Duman’s pet monstrosity flying back and forth telling tales. Previous experience had taught him it was the harpy’s'' forte and chief pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>''Curse the thing... and curse Duman too!'' he thought, fingering the weeping scar across his face. How he would love to take the foul-smelling harpy and shove it down Duman’s throat. Now he cursed himself for his wayward thoughts, his single eye looking about fearfully, dreading that Duman might step from the trees at any moment.</p>\r\n<p>The harpy was watching Hogeth with spiteful intent. The pack-masters'' train of thought, if not the actual content, was quite plain to see by the open emotions that flitted over his mutilated face and the sudden flash of terror in his eye. The harpy thought the sight most amusing and was sure the Master would too, when it told him later. It spat at Hogeth from its perch in the tree, well out of range of the whip.</p>\r\n<p>"Lord sends new orders," it screeched down, going on to relate Duman’s message. </p>\r\n<p>Hogeth almost bit his tongue off trying to stop himself from screaming. The Citog were hunters. He had promised them a chase and a kill. They would not take kindly to being told otherwise. Already they were growing restless with inaction, snapping at each other, provoking a fight. He was going to lose control if he wasn''t careful. The harpy had come to the same joyful conclusion, noting how they had begun separating into two groups that eyed each distrustfully between Hogeth’s legs. Glaring at Hogeth maliciously, it swooped low over the heads of the Citog in a deliberate act designed to exacerbate the situation. It was all that was needed. </p>\r\n<p>The Citog exploded into a frenzy of snarling fangs and flying fur, each fighting for pack, and individual, supremacy. Returning to its perch, the harpy settled down to watch the fun, jumping and clapping with glee as Hogeth struggled to regain control from the chaos. He shouted and cracked his whip over the heads of fighting Citog too crazed to notice, until one of them bit his leg and his temper snapped. From then on the whip sliced spitefully through their thick, matted fur, opening deep wounds wherever it landed and soon the area was splattered with blood and flesh and there was not one that did not bear the marks of his anger. Gradually Hogeth regained control and sanity returned. The more obdurate would take longer to heal but this gave Hogeth the insight as to which would bear close watching and strong handling. He looked up at the harpy with a mocking sneer. Inadvertently, it had actually done him a favour. The inevitable rebellion was over at the start and he had some useful information besides.</p>\r\n<p>The Citog once more under control, though they would never be fully mastered, Hogeth considered again the new orders. He baulked at the thought of having to carry them out, knowing their prey was within their grasp. The stupidity of passing up this certainty made him furious but he knew he dared not countermand Duman’s orders, or even question them aloud, in the harpy’s'' presence. All he could do was grind his teeth in frustration and carry them out.</p>\r\n<p>The harpy was in its element, storing up every movement and expression for future recounting. Disappointed as it was by the twisted result of its provocation, still it sneered at those below with the superior air of the untouchable. Loathing like bile rose in Hogeth’s throat, and his palms itched to do things to it that belong in the worst of nightmares. But as long as it was under Duman’s special protection, it was touched only at his peril. Hogeth knew he had to get rid of the thing before it drove him completely crazy, so he ordered it aloft to seek the companies'' whereabouts. </p>\r\n<p>Once it was gone he felt much more relaxed and the Citog were definitely more manageable, until he ordered them to abandon the scent! Confused and unwilling, they erupted again. Still smarting from their fresh wounds it was however, a half-hearted uprising, put down swiftly and firmly. Though forced to obey, they made certain he knew it was with great reluctance and their vociferous objections as they passed through the countryside caused many a troubled sleep plagued with disturbing dreams. All along their route, innocent livestock and wildlife paid the price of Duman’s change of tactics. </p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, with its mind set on doing all it could to advance its beloved masters'' cause, the harpy began its quest in the last place of scenting. Spying an open hayloft, it settled down to wait. With luck, it would hear something useful. It was not to be disappointed. Two men approached, their loud voices carrying easily to its ears.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, I still say you''re a fool, Parlen," said one. "You''ll not see your money again and we both know it."</p>\r\n<p>"As may be," replied Parlen. "But for sure and I''ll not see children suffer if it''s in my power to help. You saw them come in Frane. Wasn''t it plain for a blind man to see the girl was ill and the boy fair falling on his feet? And wouldn''t I be a fine man to see them sharing one horse when I''ve a perfectly good wagon going to waste. I''ll trust the man at his word. For certain his face was as honest as many another I see every day!"</p>\r\n<p>"Pah,” Frane snorted. "You said that about the Fellis and look what happened... got lumbered with that rig... that''s what. Like I said...&nbsp;you’re a fool."</p>\r\n<p>"Then it''s a fool I am, but a fool with a clear conscience. And is that why you''d be complaining now? Is it your conscience that''s bothering you? For sure you made a tidy profit out of it... prices you charged me to stable that team."</p>\r\n<p>"You paid them,” Frane laughed and slapped Parlen heartily on the back. "It''s just like I keep saying...&nbsp;you’re a fool Parlen. A heart as big as one of your pies... but a fool nonetheless!"</p>\r\n<p>The two men were laughing together as they passed out of earshot but the harpy had heard enough for its purposes. A girl, a boy and a man, these had to be the ones it was looking for. Now they had a wagon... and wagons needed roads. It would search the road. It licked its hands and ran them over its hair. It was well pleased with itself.</p>\r\n<p>"Already, Mysweet know more than stupid Hogeth,” it told the empty loft. "Why Lord suffer such one?" </p>\r\n<p>The loft did not know so it could not answer. After checking it was safe, the harpy left the loft. </p>\r\n<p>Flying high, it could see for many leagues along the road. Only one wagon travelled it away from the village &mdash; a wagon, a horse and a rider. The harpy circled lower. Suddenly, the figures disappeared. It dropped lower to find them again. An old man came into view from behind the wagon. His image was very strange...&nbsp;hazy. The harpy screamed its confusion and the old man stared upwards. Casting its eyes beyond him, the harpy spotted a second figure lying beneath the wagon but it was not a clear view so he could not tell if it was male or female. Not daring to go any closer, it flew off to report to Hogeth, who was far from pleased to see the harpy back again so soon.</p>\r\n<p>"Well?" he snarled.</p>\r\n<p>"Mysweet find. On road... have wagon."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure it''s them?"</p>\r\n<p>"Hear talk. See one. See man... two men... one man."</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth threw his hands in the air; the thing had the brain of a pea! Two men...&nbsp;one man! What was it babbling about? How could two men be one man? If carrion breath could not tell the difference between one and two how was Hogeth supposed to know if it was the same...? His thoughts suddenly backtracked as something clicked into place. Not two men... one man. Two men...&nbsp;same man! </p>\r\n<p>Now who, he smirked knowingly, had the ability to disguise their appearance? </p>\r\n<p>So that''s how Duman knew where the prey was going! </p>\r\n<p>No mysterious magic. Duman had simply discovered the ''help'' was an elf and guessed he would be taking their prey home... wherever home was.</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth used this information later when the harpy told him of the fork in the road. He decided the elf would take the left fork, rather than risk the lives of those in the village that lay to the right. A sneer twisted his already twisted features. He really did not understand the Elfin propensity of putting others first, considering it only as a weakness.</p>\r\n<p>"Of all the races, they must be the most pathetic," he said to the pack as he set them running. Cutting straight across country, they reached the lake area with the onset of the rain and finding such shelter and concealment as they could, settled themselves down to wait. Aware of the harpy’s'' adversity to water, Hogeth took extreme pleasure in constantly ordering it aloft. On the evening of the second day it returned, soaked and shivering, to report the wagon was nearing the fork. His scout returned full of excitement. A wagon was camped not far away. If Hogeth was surprised by the sudden spurt of speed of their quarry, it was overshadowed by the anticipation of imminent success. Now was his chance to gloat and strut his prowess in the faces of those whose only expectation of him was failure. How eager he was for that moment.</p>\r\n<p>The wagon was stationed on a swathe of grass that separated the lakes'' edge from the hedgerow of a neighbouring field. The camp was dark, the teeming rain preventing the occupants from making a fire. It was a downpour that pounded into the puddles forming on the sodden grass, churning and splashing the water in all directions. Yet, only a few steps away, Soul-stealer lake remained dead still. Not even the tiniest ripple marred its glassy surface. Hogeth could see the descending raindrops quite clearly, could feel the wind that must also be blowing across it but the lake was unmoved. The surface absorbing everything as though the outside elements were as nothing to it, like a mirror shows life but has no substance. A soft mist rolled off the edges of the water, floating over the bank and bringing with it a chill colder than the coldest night. It crept insidiously towards the oilskin-covered figure propped against one of the wheels. </p>\r\n<p>Hogeth thought it a strange place to camp. It was a thought that would be puzzled over by many in the future. Why had the old man stopped, when he had barely begun his journey? If they had encountered difficulties, why had he not returned to the village? It became one of the great, unsolved mysteries of the area. Strange though it was, Hogeth was not complaining. It was perfect for him. He sent the harpy to check beneath the oilskin.</p>\r\n<p>"Tis him! Old man,” it whispered excitedly on its return.</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth motioned the Citog to encircle the camp, while he crept towards the wagon. He was surprised to find only one occupant. Where was the boy? No matter, he shrugged mentally, the girl was there and she was the important one. He reached in, dragging her out with his hand over her mouth. Shocked into wakefulness, she struggled as hard as she could, kicking and scratching at whoever held her. Her terror increased as she spied the Citog slinking towards the unsuspecting figure beneath the oilskin. She twisted her head sharply and broke free of the restraining hand.</p>\r\n<p>"GRANDFATHER,” she managed to scream before the hand clamped over her mouth again. </p>\r\n<p>Throwing the oilskin aside the old man struggled to get up but the warning had come too late and the old man too slow. They were already on him and he went down under dozens of vicious, slavering fangs that ripped and tore at his fragile flesh. Mercifully, death was swift. The girl gave a muffled scream as the hot, sticky blood of her grandfather splattered about her from the warring heads of the feeding monsters. The sounds of ripping flesh and crunching bone made her vomit, spewing her terror and anguish down Hogeth’s hand and arm. He spun her round and slapped her face. Only then did he notice his mistake. This girl was dark-haired, plump of stature and older by years than the one he sought!</p>\r\n<p>"NO,” he wailed into the darkness. "The wrong ones! The wrong ones!" He threw her to the ground and his whip streaked the night in rage and frustration.</p>\r\n<p>Hearing the whip the Citog immediately backed off, giving the girl full view of their handiwork. What had once been her beloved grandfather was now no more than a few pieces of discarded bone and entrails. Her mind snapped at the sight and she threw herself into the pack, begging them to take her too. Nervously they backed away, growling through bared teeth and keeping a wary eye on the swinging whip. Numbly, the girl stretched out her hand to rest in the pool of still warm blood, touching it to her lips in a gentle kiss, unfocused eyes staring straight ahead as she pulled her grandfathers'' remains into her lap. Hogeth glared at her without pity, knowing only that she had wasted his time and effort. The first lash of pain never even registered upon the girls'' consciousness as she curiously she fingered the open flesh of her leg. Neither did the second sting across her head impinge upon her over-loaded mind. Her non-reaction inflamed Hogeth further and he increased the power of the whip. This time the lash provoked slight awareness of her predicament and she cried out as blood poured into her eyes. Again the whip struck, slicing through the bone in her arm and leaving it hanging by a thin sliver of skin and the seam of her sleeve. </p>\r\n<p>At last, the basic instinct for survival took over and she started to back away from her tormentor as Hogeth moved closer and loomed over her. Saliva dripped from yellow fangs onto her face. Eyes full of madness, she laughed at him and with her good leg, kicked out as hard as she could. Hogeth stumbled backwards, giving her time to jump up and hobble the few steps to the waters'' edge where she turned to face Hogeth, a serene smile born from her insanity playing on her lips. He made a grab for her but was left holding nothing but a strip of torn fabric as she flung herself backwards into the lake.</p>\r\n<p>Motionless waters burst into life. Grasping weeds reached out and coiled about her, dragging her down into the dark, unknown depths of her new abode. A soft sigh rippled across the surface of the lake, spreading out in waves of pleasure then disappearing abruptly into the lifeless calm of before. Hogeth dropped to his knees and stared into the dark waters. </p>\r\n<p>He thought he saw the girls’ face, open-mouthed in silent taunting, just beneath the surface, her eyes daring him to come and get her. Almost, he put in his hand to pull her out &mdash; almost... but not quite. Then the image was gone and there was only blackness. The lake did not even show him his own reflection. He edged away, unnerved by the unnaturalness of it. Getting to his feet, he realised he still had the piece of cloth in his hand and quickly flung it from him. Disturbed, frustrated and enraged, Hogeth shoved the harpy aside and joined the Citog who, taking advantage of his preoccupation, were now making short work of the hobbled horses. Gorging himself helped to expend the worst of his temper, until an approaching light called a halt to their feasting and they quickly left the scene. As soon as they were safely away, the harpy began its tirade.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell Lord," it squealed. "Hopeless, useless. Kill wrong man. Lose girl. Not give Mysweet first fill. Mysweet tell all! Lord punish good. Mysweet eat other eye when Lord finished." It spat down on Hogeth’s head as it wheeled to fly off but halted abruptly as Hogeth, mimicking the harpy’s'' nasal squawk, cried out.</p>\r\n<p>"Tis him! Old man!"</p>\r\n<p>Dropping to the nearest branch, the harpy folded back its wings.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, I thought you might change your mind," Hogeth sneered. "Perhaps I should inform the master of your part in this fiasco?"</p>\r\n<p>"Not tell! Not tell,” begged the harpy, wringing its hands and fluttering its wings in alarm. "Mysweet do better. Not tell."</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps...&nbsp;perhaps not. I''ll decide later," said Hogeth vaguely, enjoying himself immensely. At last the balance of power was in his hands and he watched with great relish while the harpy squirmed and grovelled in the face of it. He turned away, flicking a disdainful wrist in its direction. The harpy bored hatred into Hogeth’s back, making a silent promise that the pack-master would pay for this humiliation, as soon as it figured out how. Until then, it must rectify this failure.</p>\r\n<p>''Not for that,'' it cried silently, spitting in disgust at the strutting figure of Hogeth amongst the Citog. ''For Lord! Lord want. Mysweet find.'' Its face grew dreamy with thoughts of Duman then, without waiting for orders, it flew off to relocate the correct party.</p>\r\n<p>Finding the road empty all the way back to the fork, the harpy decided they must have turned right and so, leaving the road it flew directly to Issan. When it arrived it hid behind the nearest chimneystack, where it could see over the heads of the gathered crowd standing around a small cart containing the remains of last nights'' work. Its mouth watered as it gazed into the cart with hungry eyes bulging. If only the people would go away, it drooled, licking its lips.</p>\r\n<p>The sound of squelching mud drew its attention past the crowd and it edged further around the stack. A wagon was just arriving. It watched the man who climbed down to speak to the crowd closely. It was a different one; not the old man of before but the hazy image beneath was the same. Yes! This was definitely the ones it was searching for. Its eyes never left the man as he moved through the crowd and then into one of the buildings. It followed carefully over the rooftops, painstakingly searching every window until it found the right room. </p>\r\n<p>The man and boy were just leaving as it settled itself into the shadowy corner of the window-ledge. Once the door closed behind them it crept closer, flattening itself against the glass. A fat woman was fussing over the girl the man had carried inside and who was now asleep on one of the beds. It flapped its wings excitedly, scrabbling along the ledge for a better view. Suddenly the woman turned, her mouth forming an ''O'' of surprised disgust as they came face to face.</p>\r\n<p>"Away,” she cried, flinging the cloth she held at the pane of glass. </p>\r\n<p>Instinctively the harpy hopped backwards and tumbled from the ledge. Opening its wings it glided gently to the ground. Giving itself a quick shake, it made to take off again when it spied trouble. A large, black cat came padding up the alley. It ducked behind a stack of nearby barrels, peeking cautiously through a gap to see if it had been spotted and watched with growing tension as the cat stalked closer. The harpy looked about desperately for some avenue of escape, only to find it had gotten itself well and truly trapped. Edging back to the farthest corner of the space it glared back at the green eye peering straight at it. The cat mewed threateningly, thrusting an open-clawed paw through the gap. The harpy flattened itself against the wall, only just keeping out of reach. The cat jumped on top of the barrels, searching for another way in but finding none returned to probing of the gap with renewed vigour and determination. The harpy shook with fear as the hungry claws stretched closer and closer. A shrill voice echoed down the alleyway. The cat paused and turned its head towards it while the harpy held its breath, inching forward then jumping back quickly as the green eye reappeared in the gap. The voice called again and after one last, hopeful swipe through the gap, the cat ran off for an easier dinner. Its heart pumping wildly, the harpy plucked up the nerve to peek out and saw the white tip of the cats'' tail disappear around the corner. Seizing its chance, it flew back up to the safety of the rooftop. Wet and shivering, it remained there all night. </p>\r\n<p>Only once did it try to have another look through the window but the curtains had been drawn shut. It checked the barn, in case the prey had left while it was trapped by the cat. Their wagon and two horses that pulled it were still there. The big white horse was walking the streets, patrolling between the inn and the outskirts of the village. Satisfied, the harpy had returned to the chimney, pressing itself against the bricks for what little warmth they provided. </p>\r\n<p>It was still there come morning when the company emerged to continue their journey. The harpy watched them go and deemed its discomfort of the miserable night an honour, if it meant it could hand this group into the precious hands of its adored lord. Preening itself for its skill and cleverness, it dreamt of the rewards it would receive as it watched them rumble out of the village. Once assured of their direction, the harpy returned to Hogeth, who was furious to hear the news. He had already set up another ambush and now, that too, was wasted. He was also angry with himself for his gross error of judgement. He had been certain the elf would avoid the village at all costs. Nor did he believe the harpy when it said the prey was heading for the Mornay Desert. The very idea was ludicrous! No one, not even Duman’s own, braved the Mornay! Hogeth glared at the harpy suspiciously, it must be lying. His anger intensified and throwing caution to the wind, he grabbed the harpy about the throat with a lightening speed that very few would have given him credit for.</p>\r\n<p>"You better not be lying to me, carrion-breath," he threatened. "I wouldn''t put it past you. You''d love for me to fail and look a fool to the Master." He held it at arms length, squeezing as he shook it.</p>\r\n<p>"See you fail...? Yes! Lord fail? No! Mysweet not hurt Lord. Mysweet find prey... tell Hogeth. Hogeth get for Lord. Mysweet tell truth. Lord want girl. Mysweet not let girl get away."</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth had to acknowledge the sincerity in its voice, though it galled him to do so. The harpy would never do anything that might even vaguely disappoint Duman or jeopardize the wizard’s plans. Still, he would not admit it lightly.</p>\r\n<p>"I ought to wring your scrawny neck," he tightened his grip slightly for emphasis. "And rest assured I will if I find out you''re lying. However... duty before pleasure." He flung the harpy violently to the ground, aiming a kick at it that only just missed as it flew up out of reach.</p>\r\n<p>"Mysweet tell truth," it repeated vehemently, every part of its body throbbing with pain and hate. Then a sly, slow grin of evil pleasure flushed its contorted face and it screamed with malice. "Mysweet tell truth. Yes! Tell truth to Lord. Tell Hogeth strangle Mysweet. Kick Mysweet. Make Lord very angry. Yes...&nbsp;Mysweet have eyeball soon!" It snapped its teeth, dribbling juices down its chin, then flew off, squawking with laughter.</p>\r\n', 1, 19, 11, 5, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(18, 'Unwelcome visitors', 'CHAPTER SIX', '<br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="T" src="T.gif">he drizzling dawn turned into a soaking wet day. Royle finally turned up late afternoon, hitching a ride on Defiant. Jarok, overjoyed by his safe return, lifted the soggy cat into the wagon, wiped him dry with a blanket and hand fed him some of Parlens'' fish, after which Royle curled up and slept. Defiant, having off-loaded his passenger shook himself free of what water he could and with a toss of his head toward Cymon, galloped off again up the road that was rapidly becoming mire. By the time they reached the fork in the road on the morning of the third day, they were all, man and beast, thoroughly drenched and miserable. Jarok especially, who had begun to sneeze continuously, was desperately in need of a hot meal and a soft bed so, though his intended way lay to the left, Cymon took the right fork towards the village signposted as Issan.<p></p>\r\n<p>There was a great deal of commotion going on when they arrived, centred about a small cart. Cymon handed the reins to Jarok and jumped down. Pushing his way through the milling crowd, what he saw filled him with horror and dread. A bloody mess, whose shredded clothing suggested it had once been human, lay atop a pile of straw. There was not much left. Without doubt, this had to be the sickening work of Citog. Carefully guarding his expression, he turned to nearest person in the crowd.</p>\r\n<p>"What happened here?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Apparently, a local farmer found him in his field. Found what''s left of him, that is," replied the well-dressed youth.</p>\r\n<p>"Seems like he was torn to pieces," added his companion, unable to drag her eyes away from the bloody remains. Her face was alive with morbid curiosity.</p>\r\n<p>"Do you know who he was?"</p>\r\n<p>"Afraid not. I''m just passing through. But he was a local man, judging by everyone’s reaction. I say! You look as though you''ve only just arrived yourself. Perhaps you saw something?" </p>\r\n<p>Before Cymon could stop him the youth was waving his hand to get everyone’s attention.</p>\r\n<p>"Helloooo! Everybody,” he cried at the top of his voice and then pointed down at Cymon’s head. "This fellow here has just arrived and thinks he might have some information. I say, Farmer up there, where exactly did this occur old chap?" </p>\r\n<p>Cymon could cheerfully have throttled the youth but with a village full of eyes now fixed on him, he could only step closer to the cart and the farmer standing beside it.</p>\r\n<p>"Found ''im in my fields over yonder, by the old Soul-stealer," the farmer told him. </p>\r\n<p>"Then I''m afraid I can''t help," Cymon replied regretfully, shrugging one shoulder. "My family and I have come from the opposite direction. I''m sorry." To his relief the crowds'' attention turned back to their private murmurings and he was able to slip away unnoticed around to the other side of the cart.</p>\r\n<p>"Terrible business. I wish I could help," he said to no one in particular, still trying to glean as much information as he could.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothin'' anyone can do now, ''ceptin'' dig poor man ''is ''ole to rest in," replied a voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Poor old Father Brightly,” sobbed an elderly woman to his left. "Such a dear, sweet old gentleman, ''e was, never ''urt a soul, ''e never. An’ im so ''appy, settin'' off to ''is grand-daughters'' wedding." She lowered her voice. "Not a sign of the girl, you know, just a piece of ''er dress. That''s as ''ow they knew who it was,” she inclined her head towards the cart and sighed. "What on earth could''ve become of the dear child? Oh," she clutched her chest, " to think she might ''ave ended up like that! Poor old Father Brightly," and she began sobbing again.</p>\r\n<p>Deciding he had heard enough, Cymon motioned Jarok to drive the wagon over to the inn. The place was empty. He settled Alyse in a soft chair beside the roaring fire, removed Jarok’s wet clothing and boots, wrapped him in a blanket and sat him in another. Jarok stretched out his legs, placing his bare feet on the warm hearth and wiggled his toes with a sigh of pure pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t like leaving you alone but the horses need caring for," said Cymon. </p>\r\n<p>"We''ll be fine," replied Jarok. "See, Royle''s here," he said unnecessarily as the cat jumped onto his lap. "And I''ve got my knife," pulled up his sleeve. </p>\r\n<p>"Have another one," he pulled the knife from his left boot and laid it on the arm of the chair. </p>\r\n<p>"Will you go? The stables are only a few steps away. I''ll shout if I need you," promised Jarok when Cymon continued to hover.</p>\r\n<p>"Right. I''ll be as quick as I can. If anyone bothers you, I mean anyone... "</p>\r\n<p>"I thought the horses needed caring for?"</p>\r\n<p>Like the inn, the stables were deserted. Cymon unhitched the team and led them into the dry. Then he gave all three horses a good rub down and a full nosebag of grain, hoping the stableman would be sympathetic of his presumption. He worked quickly but even so, caring for three horses alone took quite a bit longer than he would have liked. He ran back to the inn, anxious that he had left Jarok and Alyse alone for too long. When he got there, Jarok was sitting at a table cradling a steaming mug in his hands. Opposite him, with his back to the door, sat a balding man dressed in short-sleeved, red shirt and an apron. Cymon stood silently in the doorway, listening.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s never been of good health," Jarok was saying. "That''s why we''re taking her to this Alchemist. We were told he''s very good. Poor mother was just the same," he sighed and finished in a soft, sad whisper. "Simply faded away."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon could hardly believe what he was hearing, not from Jarok. The boy was good. He smiled to himself, though what Alyse was going to say when heard about it all did not bear thinking about!&nbsp;He gave a faint cough.</p>\r\n<p>"Here''s father now," cried Jarok, running over and taking Cymon’s hand with a beaming smile, giving the watching innkeeper the perfect picture of a loving family. "Father, this is Griorg, the owner of the inn. Griorg, my father." Jarok introduced them politely.</p>\r\n<p>"Good day, Griorg," Cymon walked over and shook the man’s outstretched hand. "My thanks for looking after the children."</p>\r\n<p>"That''s what I''m here for, to provide care and food. Speaking of which, you look as though you could do with some yourself," replied Griorg, already halfway to the kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>As Cymon sipped his soup he inquired about a room and when he had finished, Griorg led them to one that was warm and cosy, courtesy of the kitchen directly beneath. Safe within the privacy of its walls, Jarok told Cymon the rest of his story in case he was asked.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon praised him for its simplicity and inventiveness before informing Jarok of the tragic news of the Brightly family. As horrific as it was, he had decided the boy deserved to know the extent of the dangers they faced. Predictably, Jarok was devastated that these innocent lives had paid the price of mistaken identity but realising there was nothing he could do to change it now, he drew himself up determinedly, his young face so serious it wrenched Cymon’s heart to look at it.</p>\r\n<p>"So, what now?" Jarok asked, as Cymon concluded that the Citog had abandoned their pursuit and were already somewhere ahead.</p>\r\n<p>"Push on," replied Cymon, laying an arm across the boys'' shoulder. "But we''re going to have to keep our wits about us. Anything, anything, " he stressed, "that you see, hear or feel, however small or insignificant you think it might be, let me know. I trust in your senses Jarok and you may notice something I miss. There''ll be no relaxing for a minute. And there''s one other thing," he grimaced beneath a flush of embarrassment as he got to his feet and turned out his pockets. "Lack of funds. I was so intent on everything else I clean forgot. Now we owe for the meal and for this room, as well as being indebted to the stableman," he groaned and flopped back down on the bed. A gleaming gold coin moved back and forth under his nose.</p>\r\n<p>"Where on earth...?" He exclaimed. </p>\r\n<p>"Parlen insisted, to buy something nice for Alyse when she woke up. But I think that was just an excuse so I''d take it," he said, handing Cymon the coin.</p>\r\n<p>"We owe that man a great deal," murmured Cymon. </p>\r\n<p>He returned to the room light of step and carrying a broad smile and jangling four copper coins which he dropped into Jarok’s palm. All was paid and he had even arranged for baths, he told the boy with a grin. Not long behind him came the serving woman, a plump, homely woman with a warm, motherly face, a jug of hot water and an armful of towels.</p>\r\n<p>"If''n you gents ''ud like to get along to your baths, I''ll look after the young miss," she strode purposefully into the room. "Oh, I''ll not leave her till you get back, not to worry."</p>\r\n<p>Though he trusted the woman’s word and the bath beckoned temptingly, Royle had disappeared and the hairs on the back of his neck were prickling, so he sent Jarok off alone and sat outside the door while the woman freshened up Alyse. Jarok promised to take no longer than necessary. Cymon waited while Jarok tapped on the door and was told it was all right to come and then hurried off. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse looked fresh and tidy under the woman’s'' care. Dressed in clean clothes and with her hair neatly brushed and braided, she hardly looked ill at all.</p>\r\n<p>"There now, and doesn''t she look a picture?" beamed the woman, tweaking the spotted pink bow tied to the end of Alyse’s braid. "Pretty girls should have pretty things, I always say."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok was not so sure. Alyse was not a fussy person, never given to frills and fancies, but not to appear rude or ungrateful after the woman had taken such good care of Alyse, he nodded and thanked her. As he moved across to Alyse’s bedside he thought he heard something tap lightly against the window. He pressed his nose against the glass and peered out into the already failing light of evening. The woman pulled him back quickly and drew the curtains.</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t want to be doin'' that, young master," she warned, waggling a finger. "Strange things are abroad these days. Why, only a few moments ago I saw the weirdest looking creature peering in that very window. Fair gave me the creeps and no mistake! No. You stay away from there, young master. Best safe than sorry, I always say." </p>\r\n<p>Jarok fussed over Alyse to hide his shock and horror. Somehow, even though she had not described it, he knew what she was talking about. His mouth went dry as his heart pump anxiety around his trembling body. He glanced towards the door, wishing Cymon would hurry back. The woman was standing in front of it, arms loaded and chewing her lips uncertainly.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, I''m sorry," mumbled Jarok, lifting a hand to cover a wide yawn. "That bath has made me so tired I''ve forgotten my manners. There''s no need for you to wait. Father will be back shortly."</p>\r\n<p>"Well...?" She tried to sound hesitant but it was clear she was eager to be off now the girl was longer alone. "If''n you''re sure young master, only I really do have lots to do." </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure," Jarok assured her hastily, opening the door and almost pushing her outside. As soon as she was gone he pulled back the curtains, threw open the window and leaned out. The alleyway below was dark and silent. A shudder ran down his spine and he quickly slammed the window shut. He sat on the bed next to Alyse, white faced and shaking, one knife pointed at the window, the other at the door. And that''s how a surprised Cymon found him when he returned from his bath. </p>\r\n<p>"That ''thing'' is here,” Jarok cried even before Cymon had closed the door behind him. "You know, that smelly bat thing. It''s here!"</p>\r\n<p>"How do you know?" asked Cymon, masking his dismay behind a tone of calm curiosity.</p>\r\n<p>"The serving woman... she saw it at the window," answered Jarok pacing up and down. "Well, she never actually described it as such, but that''s what it was, I''m sure of it."</p>\r\n<p>"If you''re sure, that''s good enough for me," said Cymon, carefully prising the knives from his clenched fists and putting them on the nightstand. He sat down on the bed opposite and leaned forward with his arms on his knees, while Jarok told him everything the woman had said.</p>\r\n<p>"Well there''s not much we can do about it just now," he said, after a long, thoughtful pause. "The roans need to rest and so do you. Even I can''t go forever without sleep," he leaned over and squeezed Jarok’s knee when the boy opened his mouth to deny his tiredness. "But at least we''re forewarned. Supper is already on its way up. We''ll eat, grab some sleep and set off before dawn. If the Citog were close by they would''ve been here by now, or at least made themselves heard, not absolutely true but Cymon did not want to frighten Jarok any more than he was. Defiant is guarding the street, Royle is outside the door and I shall be here," he promised, pulling a chair over to the window. "Nothing''s going to come close without one of us hearing it. I promise."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok looked round at Alyse. He would rather have gone straightaway but he could tell Cymon was adamant about waiting, so he nodded but vowed silently that he would stay awake and watch over Alyse. Tiredness and a full stomach soon got the better of Jarok’s obstinate eyelids and he slept. Cymon on the other hand spent the night pacing the room. Despite the apparently relaxed attitude he had shown Jarok, the unwelcome reappearance of Duman’s spy had him rattled. The slightest noise, every creak of the old house, every gust of wind racing through the alley, had him rushing to window and door. Whether the Citog were already bearing down on the village or still waiting for them at Soul-stealer Lake, the fact was that they were here... and this time there would be more than two! As the long night went on, Cymon finally resigned himself to the unthinkable. The Mornay. It was the last place the enemy would expect him to go and, with any luck, they would have more sense than to follow. It was the only edge he had. He nudged Jarok awake.</p>\r\n<p>Royle came bounding towards them from the rear of the inn as Cymon drove the wagon out of the stable yard, leapt up onto the tailgate and lay down at Alyse’s feet. A deep-throated growl rumbled along his tense form. His eyelids were closed to a mere slit as they fixed upon the receding inn. Eventually, what he was seeking revealed itself. A groping, grey figure poked its head around the side of the chimney and, thinking itself unseen, stood in the open watching their departure with hungry eyes. Whilst dirty hands twisted with malicious glee, the harpy threw back its head and laughed. Hackles raised, Royle flattened his ears and gave a low hiss. For many leagues the tip of his tail twitched in rhythm to his pulsing claws.</p>\r\n<p>It was but a short journey to the boundary of the Mornay Desert. There would be no gradual alteration of the landscape or climate to ease them into the harsh conditions that awaited them, Cymon told Jarok as they paused upon the threshold. It would be like stepping through an invisible doorway, separating two worlds. Jarok rose from his seat and slowly turned to gaze his fill of the world behind. Thick grass in various shades of green, studded with clover and dandelion, covered the ground beneath the glorious red-gold, orange and russet of the trees clothed in their autumn attire. The rich, brown earth of the rutted track along which they had travelled, was a myriad of scurrying insects disturbed by their passing and the air with songs of the birds travelling with them to take advantage of this easy meal. Beneath their song the leaves whispered in the breeze and below this came the shuffling of the undergrowth as some animal or other moved about its business. He lifted his eyes to the thick, billowing clouds that promised yet more rain and smiled at the rays of sunlight piercing through their gathering heaviness, showering all they touched with a warm, golden glow of hope Jarok’s eyes drank deeply of this world he loved before he faced forward once more to contemplate the Mornay.</p>\r\n<p>The joy and delight that lit his eyes was snuffed out like a candle, as he beheld the soulless wasteland of nothingness that stood in nauseating rebellion to all that Nature intended. Not a tree, a bush, a flower... not a single blade of grass...did it possess to bring life or colour to the arid, empty desolation. Not an animal, a bird or even an insect gave movement to the still, blank greyness &mdash; only grey earth, grey rocks, grey stones, as far as the eye could see, that same bland, colourless grey. He looked up hopefully. But he looked in vain. Even the sky seemed in league with whatever curse beset this barren void. It too stretched, empty as the land, without even a mere wisp of a cloud to offer shelter to earth scorched by a sun that beat down with a intensity that shimmered in a murderous haze over the parched ground. He could almost hear the tortured earth screaming out for mercy. Like so much already on this journey, he had never experienced anything like it in his life but un-like so much, this he had no desire to experience further. It was awesome in its horror, with an evilness that spread venomously across every level of awareness. He turned to Cymon, anguish and fear etched vividly into his young features and spilling freely into his voice.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t like this place Cymon. Is there no other way?"</p>\r\n<p>"None." Cymon’s answer was flat. He had no real desire to cross the desert either. "It would take too long to go around. Time we don''t have, especially with the Citog snapping at our heels." He tried to make his smile reassuring. "It''ll be alright, so long as we keep moving." He paused, and he let his gaze drift over the place they were about to enter. "It''s hard to believe now, I know... but this was once a land of extraordinary beauty. People travelled from afar just to look at it, to experience and enjoy the peace, wonder and tranquillity that existed here. In Phelise, there are many tapestries depicting this region in its days of glory. I''ll show them to you when we get there if you''d like. Pictures of woods and meadows that flourished here, of sparkling streams and trees taller than you could ever imagine. Rolling hills covered with lush grass the colour of emeralds under the suns'' tender caress. Trees so full their boughs droop almost to the ground under the weight of their fruit. Sun-ripened berries, so sweet and succulent you''d never want to eat anything else for the rest of your life! Almost every kind of creature the Mother ever created dwelt here. With happiness and laughter, they lived in harmony with each other, with the Earth and with themselves. And now... " Cymon’s voice cracked. </p>\r\n<p>"Now, there''s only pain. Pain and torment," cried Jarok, slapping the reins hard with the swift surge of emotion that washed over him. The roans broke into a canter and taken completely by surprise, Cymon was thrown off balance and left rolling in his seat.</p>\r\n<p>"Slow down,” he ordered. "They''ll be spent before evening if you drive them at this pace!" </p>\r\n<p>But Jarok seemed not to hear and he had to lean forward and grab the reins from the boys'' hands. The wagon jerked to a halt. Jarok turned his head and looked at Cymon in confusion.</p>\r\n<p>"What?" He blinked the cloud from his mind.</p>\r\n<p>Before either of them could say anything more, Alyse cried out from inside the wagon and all else was forgotten as they clambered in beside her. Cymon was alarmed to find her breathing, between the pitiful cries, was swift and harsh and her skin flushed and burning to the touch. He could see her eyes rolling beneath tightly squeezed lids as she waved her arms in the air, as though warding off blows from some unseen attacker.</p>\r\n<p>"She feels it," said Jarok, staring at Alyse with an unfathomable expression.</p>\r\n<p>"Feels what?" </p>\r\n<p>"The torment of this place."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was completely nonplussed. He himself felt sorrow over the fate of this land but Jarok was speaking in a physical, not emotional sense. How could that be possible? He shook his head. That hardly mattered at the moment, he told himself sharply and set instead to trying to help Alyse. He loosened her clothing, placed cold cloths on her brow and at her nape to try and reduce her fever and whispered soft, soothing sounds of comfort and reassurance. Nothing seemed to work and he began to fear the worst in his mind and dread it in his heart but he hid both as he looked across at Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve done all I can for the present. We have to keep moving. I''ll drive. You stay here, she will probably respond better to your voice anyway."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok continued the ministering Cymon had started, doing his best to call Alyse back from whatever tormented her but with no more success, until one of her hands brushed the soft leather of his pouch. She grasped it tightly, fingers kneading the contents as though searching for something within and when they found it, closed over it and pulled the pouch, and Jarok, firmly toward her. Jarok was puzzled. He could think of nothing in the pouch that she would want. The only value any of it had, were the memories they held about the moment and circumstance of their discovery. Certainly none held any medicinal properties &mdash; at least not that he was aware of... except the Anquas root. Of course, that must be it, he thought and&nbsp;prised open her grip to retrieve the root. He put it into her hand and pushed her fingers around it but slipping it into her fingers but all she did was moan wildly and throw it from her. Again her hands reached for the pouch. Jarok just couldn''t figure it out at all but if it made her feel better... he slipped the strap over his head. Alyse sighed deeply, hugging the pouch to her breast with both hands and almost immediately her troubled spirit eased and her physical symptoms abated. Completely bewildered, Jarok picked up the Anquas and climbed back out onto the seat beside Cymon. The elf had heard Alyse fall silent and waited with agonized, bated breath for the boys'' reaction. He was relieved therefore, when Jarok appeared next to him and said she was all right.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank the Mother,” he breathed. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok simply sat there staring at the Anquas root, that he kept turning over and over in his hands, and muttering to himself.</p>\r\n<p>"D''you want to talk about it?" offered Cymon, puzzled and concerned that Jarok did not appear as happy as he might.</p>\r\n<p>"As long as I can remember," Jarok replied, in a low, thoughtful tone, "my pouch has been a source of amusement to Alyse, not unkindly of course, but a sort of unspoken joke between us. ''One of my fancies'' she calls it and the more she wonders about it, the more I keep it a mystery. What could be so important about it now?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry... what?" Cymon was totally lost.</p>\r\n<p>"My pouch... that''s what she wanted," explained Jarok, twisting his neck to glance quickly at Alyse. "As soon as I gave it to her she calmed down. She''s clinging to it now. Why?" he shrugged. </p>\r\n<p>"Is there anything special in there? Are you certain?" asked Cymon, when Jarok shook his head to the first question.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s just it... there isn''t. I''ve been through the items over and over but there''s nothing. The only thing I could think it might be was the Anquas," he opened his hand and looked at the root. "I gave it to her but she just threw it aside."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure there couldn''t be something you''ve forgotten you had?" Cymon asked yet again, bearing in mind how protective the boy was of the pouch.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure. Oh, I know I keep it close," he said, guessing the elfs'' thoughts correctly. Cymon raised an eyebrow at the understatement. "But really, its just full of stones and feathers... silly things. You know, you must''ve collected stuff when you were a boy."</p>\r\n<p>"I did, much to my Mother’s annoyance,” he grinned before getting back to the puzzle. "What about the pouch itself?"</p>\r\n<p>"Well, my mother made it for me before I was born. Alyse told me. I suppose that''s why I make a big thing put of it. It''s the only thing I have to remind me of her." </p>\r\n<p>"Well, that''s your answer then," Cymon told him. "That''s why Alyse wanted it. It''s a comfort because it''s a part of both you and your mother."</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps," nodded Jarok, smiling as though satisfied. This explanation was one more than he had come up with and it did sound reasonable. Yet... it just didn''t feel right. Still, there was nothing he could do until Alyse awoke and he could ask her, so he let the matter drop.</p>\r\n<p>They kept moving all day, stopping only long enough to rest the horses and get a little water into Alyse. Apart from the occasional comment, they travelled in silence since the depressing heat made it hard to even hold a thought, let alone hold a conversation. The same heat also rid them of their appetites so that by the end of that first, exhausting day, all they wanted was a good nights sleep. It was not to be. Though the searing heat had passed, it was replaced with a bitter coldness that ate into the bones, making muscles ache and teeth chatter uncontrollably. Jarok tried to doze between fits of shivering but was haunted by sickly-sweet voices and something in their tone had him running back to wakefulness. Tired as he was he found sleep impossible and seeing that Cymon was also awake, he propped himself up on one elbow.</p>\r\n<p>"What happened to this place, Cymon?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon did not answer straight away, sitting lost in his thoughts, and then with a sigh he turned sorrowful eyes to Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a source of much grief to my people. Ravaged and cursed by evil, the Mornay is the work of Duman!" A current of anger tore through Cymon’s voice with such passion that Jarok gasped in surprise and he had to pause to control it before continuing. "Way, way back, before the time of treachery. This place was home to the Elfin tribe of A''mathan."</p>\r\n<p>"Really?" Intrigue chased away fatigue and Jarok wriggled himself into a more comfortable position. "I thought all the Elfin lived in Phelise?"</p>\r\n<p>"Now, they do, but not then. One tribe had... chosen..." The unintended hesitation was so slight that Jarok did not notice, for which Cymon was grateful, it was not somewhere he wanted to go right now, to leave Phelise, preferring to live outside, here, amongst others of the Mother’s children. They were a peaceful people, full of life and the joy of living. Admittedly they had a mischievous side but it was ever in fun. They would never hurt a living soul. On the contrary, they dedicated their lives to the caring and nurturing of the Mother’s creatures, plants, even the people. They created this region as a witness to their love for the Mother. Nowhere, not even Phelise, could compare to Iåñya M''ath!"</p>\r\n<p>"What a beautiful name... ''Iåñya M''ath''," repeated Jarok, trying to twist his tongue around the unfamiliar words. "What does it mean?"</p>\r\n<p>"It''s impossible to translate precisely," answered Cymon. "At best, I could say it meant ''Mother’s Glory''."</p>\r\n<p>"It doesn''t quite have the same ring to it, does it?" remarked Jarok in disappointment. Cymon ruffled his hair.</p>\r\n<p>"Never mind. One day I''ll teach you Elfin and then you can appreciate it properly."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok thanked him with enthusiasm, overjoyed at the prospect and also with the thought that he might meet some of these A''mathan in Phelise. </p>\r\n<p>He asked Cymon if he would.</p>\r\n<p>"Alas, no," replied Cymon. "The A''mathan are no more."</p>\r\n<p>"Why? What happened to them? What exactly happened here?" Jarok’s tone was so outraged that the latter was more of a demand than a question.</p>\r\n<p>For the first time, Cymon wished the boy was not always so full of questions. He blinked slowly, taking time to push down the angry bitterness rising in his heart and compose himself. </p>\r\n<p>"Duman happened," he stated bluntly. "He sent his minions into Iåñya M''ath... Citog and other abominations... twisted forms that were once the perfections of the Mother. They massacred the A''mathan, down to the last male, female and child. The A''mathan fought bravely, but in vain. They were nurturers, not warriors. Even their gift of form taking couldn''t save them." </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s eyes widened at this point but he didn''t want to interrupt. Later, he would learn of their ability to transform themselves into other creatures. But for now he wanted to hear about Iåñya M''ath.</p>\r\n<p>"When they had finished with all the Elfin they could find the servants of evil turned on all the other inhabitants, regardless of race. And after these, the wildlife, fish and fowl. By Duman’s command, they eradicated every living thing. But Duman wasn''t satisfied with just this. A rain of death poured down from the sky that destroyed the plant life, even to the last seed hidden in the earth. It poisoned the waters, so that even in their depths none should find sanctuary. Yet it still wasn''t enough for his evil heart. He sent a curse that settled as thick fog over the land, hiding it from view for many years. Over time it seeped away, deep into the ground where it lives still. Outside was all that remained of the jewel of Elfinkind when eyes next gazed upon it. Iåñya M''ath... h''ysnäræ... murdered!"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok was stunned. Sickened, by the violent, wanton and deliberate destruction of so much life. He was lost in the enormity of it and, like Cymon, allowed the tears to wash his cheeks until another thought entered his mind and dropped like a stone to his chest, knocking the wind out of him and freezing his heart. The terrifying source of evil in Cymon’s tale, the terrible darkness capable of the actions the elf had described, was the same one that was after Alyse! He grabbed Cymon’s arm, beside himself with panic.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon winced under the strength of his pinching grip.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon! We can''t let Duman get Alyse,” he almost screamed in his desperation.</p>\r\n<p>"We won''t... we won''t," Cymon repeated over and over as he pulled Jarok onto his lap and rocked his shaking body back and forth until the boys'' sobbing ceased, all the while scathing himself for his stupidity in telling such an emotional and provocative tale when the boy was so exhausted and Alyse still so frail. Where was his sense? He knew how deeply Jarok got involved in the stories... </p>\r\n<p>"Hush,” he said softly, as Jarok moaned and stirred restlessly, and began to hum an old Elfin lullaby that his mother used to sing. Soothed by the gentle song and the warmth of Cymon’s body, Jarok drifted into full unconsciousness.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry, Alyse," Cymon whispered to her sleeping form over Jarok’s head. "I never meant to frighten him so."</p>\r\n<p>Only the wind answered. Cymon sighed into the silence, suddenly feeling more alone than he had ever thought possible. Whether to comfort Jarok or himself, he did not know but he resumed his song until he too fell into a fitful sleep. </p>\r\n<p>They began that night... in their dreams. </p>\r\n<p>The whispers. </p>\r\n<p>And once they had begun, they did not stop... night or day.</p>\r\n<p>Unintelligible at first, an annoying buzzing in their ears. A constant irritant that would not let up, or allow itself to be ignored. Insidiously, the scheming voices wormed their way into their minds. Searching out their weaknesses. Twisting them, feeding them, until doubts grew to fears and pain to agony. Cleverly sowing seeds of mistrust between them and hopelessness at their situation. Gaining strength with each passing day.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok hid his assault from Cymon. The whispers told him that the elf would laugh and call him a silly child. That he would say Jarok was going mad and would leave him there to die. They said the elf would be ashamed of his lack of stamina and perseverance... had admitted as much to them already. Reminded him of his warriors'' promise not to let the elf down. When Jarok tried to confront them for the evil they were and thought about telling Cymon, they said the elf would berate him for his childish fantasies and turn his back on him. This and more the whispers fed him. To start with Jarok ignored it, recognised it as nonsense and laughed at it. But as he grew more exhausted from lack of sleep and food, and Cymon seemed to grow silent and distant, the voices became more believable and he started to listen.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon had no idea that the demons had already begun their attack Jarok, so well did the boy keep up his facade. He thought the boys'' innocence and feyness must have been providing a natural protection, never considering that it might be the demons encouraging this belief. And bearing in mind how badly he had frightened Jarok with his story of the A''mathan, he decided it would be best not to mention his own situation since he was certain that his strong, Elfin spirit was able to resist the demons'' wiles. </p>\r\n<p>''Why upset the child further with things he need not know about,'' the voices advised him. Cymon agreed, believing the voice to be his own guiding commonsense and so remained silent, confident of a successful crossing.</p>\r\n<p>Within this web of deceit they travelled. Subjected to a continuous invasion of the mind and demoralizing of spirit that neither knew of, as well as suffering the physically harsh, battering effects of the climate on the body. Days spent sweltering in the blistering heat. Sweat-sodden clothes clinging to sore covered bodies growing visibly thinner by the day from lack of food and loss of moisture. Parched and swollen tongues behind cracked and swollen lips, burning eyes, forced to stay open, blurred and streaming in the glare of a relentless sun beating down on heads already throbbing from the endless whisperings.</p>\r\n<p>At first the nights were easier. During their sleepless icy chill, Cymon would regale Jarok with happier tales of the A’mathan that enabled them both to block out the other voices as they were transported to another time and place. But too soon, these were not enough. Warning bells began to chime in Cymon’s head as Jarok showed less and less interest in the stories and took to huddling as far away from Cymon as the close confines would allow, with his knees pulled tight under his chin and doing nothing but shiver and stare at Alyse. Each time his concern urged him to talk to Jarok, the voices told him he was being paranoid. </p>\r\n<p>''The child was simply too tired and too worried about his sister to listen to silly stories!'' </p>\r\n<p>The black circles under Jarok’s eyes certainly bore witness to this. Cymon couldn''t remember the last time either of them had really slept and so accepted this was probably the case. So he left Jarok to his own thoughts and thus, bit by bit, the wall between them grew higher.</p>\r\n<p>The horses too were suffering badly. Their bones were sticking out at all angles and their hooves were cracked and bleeding. Patches of raw flesh bled beneath the traces the roans wore. Cymon soaked strips of blanket with precious water to make soothing pads, to try to alleviate some of their pain, but he doubted their effectiveness. Every breath was agony as they struggled to fill dirt-congested lungs with still drier, dusty air. Yet through it all, though coughing and choking with every painful step of leaden legs, they courageously continued to pull the wagon, stubbornly refusing to give up. </p>\r\n<p>Defiant never left their sides, nickering soft encouragement and licking their sore necks. Cymon knew Defiant would willingly do his share to relieve their burden but he also knew that the roans were a pair. They might gain physical relief from Defiant’s help but their mental attitude and morale would deteriorate. They worked as one and to split them up would not be to their benefit at all. Though Cymon tried explaining this, it was obvious that his Defiant’s guilt at not doing his share rested heavily upon him. Cymon’s heart bled for them all.</p>\r\n<p>Excluding Alyse, whose trance-like state appeared to render her immune to all effects, Royle fared best of all. He stayed by Alyse’s side during the day, venturing out only in the cold of night and returning just before dawn to disappear again into the shaded wagon. So elusive was the cat, that had Cymon not spotted his comings and goings every so often, he might have forgotten he was with them at all! Cymon wondered now and again, what Royle found to do in this vast, desolate nothing.</p>\r\n<p>With each passing day they found it more and more difficult to keep going. Jarok was finding it increasingly hard to remember exactly what he was doing there. Every day he ached more, in body and spirit, until all he wanted to do was lie down and drift away. Each moment was a constant war between willpower and whispers, between resistance and surrender. Only when he was tending to Alyse did Jarok find some semblance of peace within himself. When he was with her the whisper left him alone but as soon as he left her side, even only as far as the other side of the wagon, they were back. Sometimes, Jarok thought he heard her urging him to talk to Cymon and he determined to do so. But once outside, alone, he would imagine that Cymon was sneering at him. Laughing. Waiting for him to show weakness so he would have an excuse to abandon him and Jarok would turn away and say nothing.</p>\r\n<p>And the whispers laughed.</p>\r\n<p>Every moment that passed, Cymon worried about Alyse, about Jarok, the horses, Royle, especially about Jarok. The boy was growing ever more listless, dark-eyed and brooding. As Cymon walked at the head of the team he could feel Jarok’s eyes boring into his back, yet the boy refused to look him in the face, averting his eyes whenever Cymon tried to make contact. To talk to him was even harder and the few words Cymon did manage to get out of him were terse and sullen. This was not the Jarok he knew. There were other worries too, to occupy Cymon’s overcrowded mind. Each day they travelled more slowly, rested more often and drank more water, which meant their precious supply was dwindling at an alarming rate. Having lost all track of how far they had come, Cymon had no idea how far they had yet to go and his fears for their survival pressed heavier upon him with each mouthful they consumed. He began to pass over his own share in an effort to conserve what little they had left. Each time he lifted the lid on the barrel, he offered a silent plea to the Mother that it would be enough. So Cymon worried about everyone and everything... and grew weaker.</p>\r\n<p>And the whispers waited.</p>\r\n<p>It may have been the twelfth day... or some other day...&nbsp;Cymon had lost count and did not altogether care... but whichever day it was, they awoke to a gentle breeze blowing in from the north. They lifted their faces to its cooling caress and for the first time in ages, Cymon saw Jarok smile a genuine smile and his spirit rose. He should have known better! A wolf in sheep’s clothing, this soothing friend quickly became yet one more enemy, whipping up into a violent dust storm. Cymon and Jarok, blinded and scarcely able to breathe, struggled to free the roans from their traces. They covered the heads of all three horses and tied them to the wheels, then groped their way into the shelter of the wagon, pulled down the canvas opening and tied it securely. All they could do now, was wait it out. </p>\r\n<p>The howling wind whistled around the wagon, rocking it dangerously close to overturning. Dirt, stones and ripping gusts battered the canvas until it eventually split and fluttered madly from its ties. Cymon and Jarok pulled the blankets tightly over themselves and Alyse, for what little protection they could from the swirling dust now pervading their shelter. Huddled closely together through necessity, Cymon could feel the shudders running through Jarok’s body and before the proximity of Alyse’s presence calmed him, Cymon heard at last, the muttering evidence of Jarok’s assault.</p>\r\n<p>''Dear Mother, what have I done?'' Cymon cried silently. He had to get the boy out of here soon!</p>\r\n<p>For the moment however, they were going nowhere. The storm raged on throughout the rest of the day and all the night. Not until well after sunrise the next morning did it blow itself out. Cymon stepped down from the wagon in trepidation, dreading what he may find. To his joy and amazement, not only were the horses still there but also they were still standing! All three were in a terrible state; battered, torn and bleeding; but neighed happily as he approached, responding with nuzzling lips to his tender and careful stroking. He gave them as much water as they wanted and then, while they were feeding, washed their wounds of the dirt and grit as gently as he could. When they were done, he padded the roans'' backs and started to fix them in the traces, calling to Jarok to come help him. There was no answer and no sign of the boy. He called again, louder, and still Jarok did not appear. Disturbed, Cymon went back to the tailgate. Jarok was sitting exactly as he had left him. He turned him round to face him and what he saw, or rather what he didn''t see caused Cymon’s heart to plummet. Jarok’s eyes were glazed and vacant, as though the boy no longer resided in his body, staring out of his gaunt face like empty, black holes.</p>\r\n<p>"No,” cried Cymon. "This can''t be... it must not be!"</p>\r\n<p>He grabbed Jarok by the shoulders and shook him roughly.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok?" He cried, his voice catching on the panic that slipped into his tone. "Jarok, I know you''re in there. Answer me!"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok remained motionless and unresponsive. Cymon hurried to fetch some water and tried to get him to drink. The liquid spilled out from his lips and dribbled down his chin. Cymon tipped the rest over the boys'' head, feeling a flash of hope as he blinked the dripping water out of his eyes. Cymon leant closer, their faces almost touching.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok, listen to me now. I know you''re hurting and probably thinking all sorts of things... but they aren''t true. You hear voices don''t you? Don''t listen to them Jarok, they tell lies! Listen to me. To me... Cymon. Come back and talk to me Jarok. We can get through this together."</p>\r\n<p>Though he made no answer, a tear trickled out the corner of Jarok’s eye. Cymon closed his own, aching with the desire to gather the boy up and hold him close. To tell him it was all right. To rock him gently to sleep, away from the nightmare he was living. The whispers fed the desire and without realising, Cymon began to climb into the wagon. A sharp, searing pain knifed through his head as Royle hissed and spat in his face. Cymon staggered backwards, self-awareness returning as he hit the ground. </p>\r\n<p>What was he thinking of? </p>\r\n<p>The boy was on the threshold of his grip on life, the last thing he needed was sympathy. It would be extremely dangerous, probably fatal. What Jarok needed was purpose... not sleep. Cymon had to decide quickly how to proceed but even before he could conceive a single thought, there was a sudden violent swell of voices in his mind, filling it with inane insanities, threats, and wheedling coercions, until he thought his head would explode. Louder and louder they rose, sending him to the brink of madness. He pressed his hands to his head, his face contorted with torturous agony. Somewhere outside the ringing of his ears he thought he heard a cry... perhaps it was himself... he didn''t know. </p>\r\n<p>"Y''sièn! Elfin!"</p>\r\n<p>His proud Elfin spirit responded... he was better than this! Gritting his teeth he forced one hand downwards, to his boot. Drawing out the knife secreted there, he raised it and sliced deeply into the palm of his left hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Shiená Y''siènalei q pêhatäl! Servants of evil, with Elfin blood I curse thee,” he cried out and stabbed the blood soaked blade into the ground. The ground shook and a great whoosh of air blew up and over him and then... blessed silence.</p>\r\n<p>He pulled Jarok out of the wagon and made him to stand, then placed his bloodied hand on the boys'' forehead and repeated his words. Jarok moaned. Cymon sighed with relief. The demon bonds had loosened... but not enough, Jarok was still far away. Hating himself for what he was about to do next, Cymon raised his right hand and slapped Jarok hard about the face.</p>\r\n<p>"Wake up, boy! We''ve a long journey still ahead," he said, as roughly as his aching heart would allow. "I''ve my own responsibilities, must I take yours too?" Cymon watched the ugly, red weal swell Jarok’s cheek as he waited for him to respond.</p>\r\n<p>''Come on, come on Jarok!'' he whispered silently, over and over as he shook the boy again.</p>\r\n<p>"What kind of warrior are you?" he demanded sternly when Jarok did not respond. "Where''s that resolve you promised me?"</p>\r\n<p>Still nothing. He snapped his fingers in Jarok’s face.</p>\r\n<p>"That for your resolve! You''re no warrior, just a boy with a head full of fancies," he threw over his shoulder as he began to walk away. </p>\r\n<p>"I am so a warrior! You said so yourself,” Jarok’s shout was weak but it was firm.</p>\r\n<p>Just as Cymon had hoped, his accusations had ignited a spark of anger in Jarok, rekindling his determination, his life, and his spirit!</p>\r\n<p>''Yes... I did. And you are!'' Cymon cried silently, but hid his joy behind a mask of stone as he turned to the obstinate-faced young boy who stood in a posture of fist-clenched defiance glaring at him. Cymon’s heart swelled with pride and he had to turn away quickly before it pushed through his mask.</p>\r\n<p>"Then see to your duties,” he snapped tersely. </p>\r\n<p>As soon as the team was hitched Cymon strode off, leaving Jarok to follow with the wagon. Out of sight of Jarok’s gaze, Cymon was free to give way to the emotions he had been forced to hide. But the demons of the Mornay were not ones to give up that easily and though they maintained their silence for the time being, they remained lurking in the background. </p>\r\n<p>Watching... Waiting...</p>\r\n<p>If their journey had been hard before, it was made virtually impossible in the aftermath of the storm. A thick pile of soft, powdery dirt coated the landscape that everything look deceptively flat and even. They wasted a considerable amount of valuable time in having to repeatedly dig the wagon free from some undetected rut or pothole. And when they were not doing this, they were trying to back the wagon up to go around rocks and boulders hidden by drifts and dunes. A permanent cloud of dust, stirred up by the horses'' hooves and wagon wheels, hung over them; coating their eyes, clogging their throats and nostrils, abrading their wounds and sores and leaving them exposed to the poison it contained. </p>\r\n<p>By mid-afternoon Cymon’s hand was already so badly infected and swollen he could no longer use it and with the sun beating down hotter than ever, each time Jarok got down from the wagon to help Cymon free it, the climb back up appeared higher and was more taxing. The roans were on the point of collapse. Poison oozed from beneath their harnesses and with each stumbling step, they cried out pitifully. </p>\r\n<p>Defiant plodded along beside them, stripped of his prancing pride by his guilt over the lack of his suffering compared to theirs. His head hung low in sorrow and shame and his once shining, silver coat now a dull, blood-streaked grey.</p>\r\n<p>As he looked upon the tortured bodies of his companions... saw what he had brought them down to... Cymon hated himself for so dismally failing those who had trusted him. Once again the fact of his lack of readiness rose up to taunt him. </p>\r\n<p>What arrogance was in him to think he could traverse the Mornay and survive? </p>\r\n<p>Ready and waiting, the demons seized upon these thoughts, to get under his guard, attacking with a vengeance. Defiant, so in tune with his life-long friend, quickly realised there was something seriously wrong from Cymon’s low mumbling and shuffling step. Nickering softly to the two roans, he trotted over to Cymon. But even their deep comradeship, that Cymon prized above all else, could no longer bring him solace. Absently, he cursed at the horse and pushed him away. Defiant whinnied his confusion but Cymon ignored him. The horse looked from Cymon to the rest of the pitiful group and decided on his own course of action. Rearing in front of Cymon, he pawed the air and let out a challenging scream. Then he galloped off into the distance. Cymon watched him go as from afar. He had the impression that he should be calling out to him, to stop him from going off alone, but he could not summon the strength.</p>\r\n<p>“You have done this,” came the accusing voices almost immediately. “Brought them all to this end. Look at them: weak and wasted. They are already dead, they just do not know it!”</p>\r\n<p>Obediently Cymon turned his gaze upon the Jarok and the roans.</p>\r\n<p>“Why prolong their suffering? Leave them here. They are only holding you back.” </p>\r\n<p>Now the voices became persuasive, optimistic. </p>\r\n<p>“On your own you could make it easily. It is not far now. You could finish the crossing and bring back help.”</p>\r\n<p>"Yes," muttered Cymon. "I could do that. I should go ahead and come back for them with fresh horses and water."</p>\r\n<p>“That''s right,” encouraged the demons. “Bring back fresh horses. It would not take you long.”</p>\r\n<p>Unconsciously, Cymon’s steps began to veer away from the wagon.</p>\r\n<p>“Yes, this way, just over here and you are free,” the voices, cried excitedly. “Just a few more steps. To save them, you must save yourself. This way. Save yourself!”</p>\r\n<p>"Save myself? Save myself? Yes! Save myself,” repeated Cymon. Sharp claws raking down his back cut through the mesmerizing words, startling Cymon back into reality. Royle stood in his path, hackles raised and spitting angrily. Cymon looked up and saw to his amazement just how far he had moved from the wagon. He blessed the cat and bent down to stroke him but Royle backed away with a full-throated rumble.</p>\r\n<p>"I know. No more stray thoughts, I promise,” Cymon stated firmly, retracing his steps back to the wagon. That was when he realised Defiant was missing. A vague image of him galloping into the distance flashed through his mind but it was hazy and blurred and he was not sure whether it was real and if it was, how long ago it had been. He searched as far as his eyes could see. There was no sign of him, not even a dust-cloud.</p>\r\n<p>“Jarok,” he nudged the half-unconscious boy. "Have you seen Defiant? When did he leave?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok shook his head and shrugged with sluggish disinterest. Cymon swung away, curbing the impatient urge to shout... it was not the boys'' fault. He called Defiant’s name, put his fingers to his mouth and whistled as hard as his cracked lips would allow. Nothing. Royle mewled softly at his feet.</p>\r\n<p>“He wouldn''t run off without telling me. I know he wouldn''t. Defiant! Defiant!” He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted in all directions. He dropped to his knees. "Where is he Royle? What have I done?" Cymon gazed at the cat in despair. Royle looked back at him, then at the wagon and then took off at a run. "Royle, No! Not you too! Royle come back,” Cymon kept shouting but the cat ignored him.</p>\r\n<p>The dust swirled about him and a swarm of bees buzzed in his ears. He jumped to his feet, desperately trying to maintain his guard against the gamut of emotions that flooded over him. Cymon called the Mother’s protection on his two absent friends as he lost sight of Royle and went back to the wagon. He felt a great urge to curse himself and delve into what he had done but he stamped on it. Three words he repeated over and over in his mind to fill it and remind him why he was there and what he had to do. </p>\r\n<p>''Alyse and Jarok''... ''Alyse and Jarok''.</p>\r\n<p>Though the roans tried valiantly, giving of both heart and spirit, as twilight descended the inevitable happened. One of them went down. Spent and broken both physically and mentally, it could give no more and as the roan dropped the wagon pitched violently, throwing Jarok from the seat. He lay so still that Cymon was terrified he was dead until he groaned in pain. Thankfully, the soft dirt had cushioned his fall and he was only unconsciousness. With shaking arms, Cymon picked him up and laid him gently beside Alyse. Tears dropped onto her face as he covered Jarok with a blanket. Cymon did not noticed, why should he? He did not even know he was crying.</p>\r\n<p>Even before he looked at the horse, Cymon knew there was no hope for the animal. Sadly he stripped them both of their harnesses. It was all he could do for them now, release them and allow their final moments to be ones of freedom. Laying down beside the dying horse, he stroked its neck softly, murmuring soothing words both to it and to its brother that remained at its side whinnying in distress &mdash; words of praise for their heart and courage, begging words, for their forgiveness for the painful end to which he had brought them. A sob caught in his throat and his red-rimmed eyes flickered to the tattered remnants of the canvas covering behind which Alyse and Jarok lay. The end was near for all of them. Without the roans they had no chance at all. Moments of decision flashed before his eyes. Decisions that maybe could have saved them time, so they would not have been forced into taking this route. There were moments when a ''yes'' or a ''no'' could have spared them this fate. Now it was too late. It was too late because he had delayed too long at the cottage. It was too late because he had interfered in the Elders'' business. Too late because he was too arrogantly stupid to do as he was told!</p>\r\n<p>“Too late... Too late, “ jeered the demons, seizing their moment through the tunnel of his despair.</p>\r\n<p>Anger flickered at their eagerness. Their tone altered getting softer, sympathetic and helpful, now.</p>\r\n<p>“ You say it is too late? Of course it is not too late. Come to us. We can help you. Come... let us help you.'' </p>\r\n<p>Grief stricken, guilt ridden and unbearably lonely, Cymon leaned toward their pity. Instantly the demons grabbed him. Their touch stabbed through his core like a knife in his heart. </p>\r\n<p>"Lies! Lies,” cried his spirit, rekindling his resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Forcing his eyes open he tried to rise but his body felt like stone and his head, too heavy to even lift from his chest, was buzzing with the force that dragged him down towards unconsciousness. With all his being Cymon fought, against the whispering demons and his own desperate need for sleep. As soon as the thought entered his head, the demons used it.</p>\r\n<p>“Why do you struggle so? Close your eyes. Sleep... sleep,” they murmured, just as he had murmured to the roan only a few short moments ago. “Do not concern yourself over your friends. We will take care of them also. Come... and have peace.”</p>\r\n<p>Peace. Rest. Silence. How he yearned for it! </p>\r\n<p>It took every ounce of his strength to keep his eyelids open. In his blurred vision, the land tilted from side to side, like the deck of a ship on a troubled sea. With macabre fascination he watched the dust on which he lay rise up and take shape &mdash; a grey and menacing shape with blood red eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"I know you,” croaked Cymon, straining to concentrate. But the name of the mysterious being eluded him. It drew closer, grinning with purest evil. He tried to lift his arms to defend himself but he was paralysed, unable even to release the shudder that built up inside as the thing crawled over his body. He was helpless as a stranded whale and the creature knew it! With slow certainty it came, delighting in the light of fatalism that spread across the elf’s face. Under the malicious, red gleam of its eyes, a tongue ran in taunting malice over needlepoint teeth as it advanced. Putrid breath washed hotly over his face as the teeth descended lower. </p>\r\n<p>Other sights flitted across the edges of his blocked vision. Warped sounds intruded upon his muddled brain &mdash; bits and pieces that made no sense to his enfeebled mind. Flashes of purest white broke the lock between the blood-hungry gaze and his own. There was a scraping sound on the dirt near his head, a strange pulsation of the air. He thought he heard Defiant scream but he knew his friend was gone, probably dead, so that couldn''t be right unless this was all a dream. </p>\r\n<p>But the teeth that again began to descend toward his eyes seemed very real and he closed his eyelids in instinctive defence. Something warm and soft slithered over his legs.</p>\r\n<p>“Any moment now,” he thought, “and those teeth must pierce my flesh!” </p>\r\n<p>He waited with a strange morbid calm. But no pain came. Instead, there was a piercing scream and then a heavy silence. He wanted to open his eyes and see what had happened. Where the thing had gone. Maybe he would... later. He was too tired just now.</p>\r\n<p>“A disturbing dream, was it not? Do not fear. See, we have soothed it away. Think on it no more. Sleep. Sleep now,” insisted the demons. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon heard himself muttering something about mewling cats and warm, gentle chuffs, smelling so reminiscently of Defiant, blowing on his cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>“They are gone. Dead,” said the voices decisively. “They left you, remember? All have abandoned you. Only we have stayed because we are your true friends. Sleep. Friend.”</p>\r\n<p>But still, some spark, some shred of sanity, some defiance of spirit, resisted.</p>\r\n<p>On and on the voices droned, growing louder and ever more confident, deceiving and lying, whilst they enticed him with his increasing desire for peace. As their control multiplied, so did the despair they induced in him and bit-by-bit, he surrendered to their will. An incredible weight pressed down on him, dragging and sucking him to a promised oblivion that was eternal nightmare. Too late he saw the truth but the further he fell, the greater the demons overwhelmed him. In his mind’s eye, he saw his spirit as a candle trying to hold the darkening evil at bay behind the rapidly diminishing aura of its tiny flame. All too soon, just the flame lingered defiantly... then it too began to flicker.</p>\r\n<p>"Wake up elf! You are in gravest danger. Fight! Wake up,” cried an urgent voice, so different from the pervasive wheedling of the others. It rang clear with truth and sincerity. And it spoke in Elfin! </p>\r\n<p>The realisation brought new hope and the candle flared. Cymon clawed his way toward that hope but the demons were of no mind to give up what they had worked so hard for, and what was so very nearly theirs. Enraged, they pulled him back... hard and fast... all pretence gone. Vainly, he made one last stand but was too weak alone. Then, as by some miracle, he heard a familiar voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon, canst thou hear me? Speak, that I may find thee."</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse? Alyse, is that you?" he cried in disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>"Fight Cymon, until I canst reach thee."</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse, where are you?" he called back, certain now it was her despite the strangeness in her speech.</p>\r\n<p>"Have courage! I am here."</p>\r\n<p>As a hot knife through butter, he saw a golden hand slice through the darkness. The demons recoiled violently from its glowing light but not before they bombarded his being with all the ravings of their dementia. Rage... Frustration... Seething, bitter hatred... Vile malevolence. These and much more burst over him, in a tidal wave of the sheer terror she evoked within them. He could almost feel Alyse’s arms wrap themselves around him, shielding him from them. </p>\r\n<p>"Take mine hand."</p>\r\n<p>He needed no second telling, mentally reaching out and until he saw the two hands clasped tightly together. The sensation of being pulled out of danger, he found strangely physical as well as mental. And then he fell, exhausted, back into reality. Disjointed and disorientated, bruised and battered in mind and body, and feeling as though he had been trampled on by a herd of horses, he tried to sit up.</p>\r\n<p>"Slowly," cautioned Alyse, pressing his head down into the wave of dizziness that overcame him. When it had passed she held a mug to his lips, allowing small sips of its contents to trickle onto his tongue. Water had never tasted so sweet! He started to speak but she hushed him quiet and told him to sleep. He stiffened.</p>\r\n<p>"Do not fear. It is perfectly safe to do so. The demons are gone and shall not harm you." She smiled and then her left eyebrow rose slowly in that old familiar gesture. "Later, we shall talk about your foolishness in entering here and the danger to which you exposed Jarok. You were supposed to be taking care of him Cymon." </p>\r\n<p>Reassured by the stern tone that had so often threatened no supper, Cymon reached up and cupped her cheek, then closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift.</p>\r\n<p>"Sleep well, Cymon. Phnyå Y''sièn."</p>\r\n', 1, 20, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(19, 'A shadow of an idea', 'CHAPTER SEVEN', '<br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="S" src="S.gif">itting at his desk inside the tower, quill in hand as he scribed down fresh ideas for new spells, Duman knew immediately the harpy had been struck. He had given life to the creature using his own blood during an experiment designed merely to pass the time and had been well pleased by the result. He had used it as a means of passing on any pain or inconvenient emotion he could not be bothered to deal with and it had proven a useful conduit for relieving himself of unwanted pressures on many occasions.<p></p>\r\n<p>Now Duman was suffered to experience the less positive aspects of this special bonding and his back arched as the snake struck, crying out as he felt the piercing fangs force their way deep into the flesh, pumping out their deadly venom. Together with the harpy he experienced the muscle seizures as they cramped in paralysis, making breathing impossible. His own veins burned with the harpy’s struggles that aided the liquid death along its course through the victim. He knew the end was inevitable, for though the harpy was well equipped to fight a physical foe, it could not defend itself from the enemy within. Duman grabbed his chest as the harpy suffered the strictures that prevented its heart from beating. For a few beats his own heart fluttered alarmingly and his eyes darkened with fear. In the final moment, as the harpy’s life force ebbed away, Duman was utterly amazed to find himself actually staring through its eyes. Then it was over, the harpy was dead and contact was severed. But it was long and revealing enough to incense.</p>\r\n<p>White with rage, he let out a blood-curdling scream, giving vent to the upsurge of energy suddenly roiling within him. The entire fortress squirmed before his rising anger that permeated through every stone and crevice... from the tallest tower to the deepest bowels. An audible silence descended and every occupant cowered, hardly daring to breathe, lest they attract the attention of their master’s wrath. When his scream subsided, Duman leaned against the parapet staring out of the window. His face grew dark. Darker even than the ever-present cloud hovering overhead and impossible though it might seem, his mood deepened still blacker. Yet this mood &mdash; that raged within and around him &mdash; had nothing to do with the harpy’s death...&nbsp;though it would have been natural to suppose so. No. Once his enforced sharing of its demise had ceased, the fact of the harpy’s death had washed over him as a mere inconvenience at the necessity of raising another. It was the vision through the harpy’s eyes that had inflamed him. A flash of sight only but it had been enough. No snake of nature survived in the Mornay. This was a snake by another name! </p>\r\n<p>"Yushok,” he spat, spinning around and sending a shard of lightning energy across the room and creating another window for the tower. </p>\r\n<p>As he uttered the A''mathans'' name, an image of his face took shape in front of Duman. Heart shaped, with high cheekbones and pointed chin. Long, blonde hair worn plaited down the elf’s back. Fringe cut low across eyes coloured the deep, deep blue of the night sky, so deep they were almost black. Framed in long, sweeping eyelashes below fine, upward sloping brows those eyes danced with mischievous laughter and the pure pleasure of being alive. </p>\r\n<p>During their times together, Duman had found it increasingly infuriating that they never lost this quality, no matter how dire the circumstances became. For some reason he could never fathom, Yushok’s ears had also been another continued annoyance to Duman. Though characteristically slender and long-pointed they were so unlike those of other Elfin that hugged the head neatly tight, in that they stuck out from the sides of his head like two handles. Duman had always considered them to be demeaning of the Elfin nation and maintained that Yushok natured them so with his magic as a deliberate and personal insult towards himself. </p>\r\n<p>Almost as though the image had heard his thoughts, the pink, bow-shaped lips curled into a knowing smile exposing neat pearl teeth. To taunt and mock him further the ethereal face turned right, revealing the mark of his tribe carried high on his left cheekbone. The Mother’s circle of gold, delicately entwined in green vine and divided into three segments; one white, one brown, one blue; signifying sky, land and sea. This was the mark of the A''mathan!</p>\r\n<p>All members of the elfin nation possessed power but it was an insubstantial power with which they could merely project an image over their own. Admittedly it was power that none other race possessed, but even so it was only illusionary. The A''mathan were different. To them, and them alone, the Mother had given the power substance so that they did not merely project but could actually transform themselves into any creature they desired. And it was even more than this. Once they mastered the transformation, they not only took the form... they became that creature, with all the senses, skills and abilities that made it what it was and enabled it to survive in its environment. Once they had mastered at least one creature from each element, then they were given the ''Mark of the Mother'' and could truly call themselves, A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>Ever since he was a child, Duman had secretly envied them their gift and nurtured a hidden desire to possess this power himself. He could not remember how often he had cried himself to sleep, blaming his parents for bearing him into the tribe of warriors and not into the A''mathan. Of course, as he grew and matured he had realised the futility of these desires; he could not change what he was; and so had channelled all his energies into becoming the best he could be according to his birth. As he did so, he learnt to love it. And so he forgot his childish fantasies in his love for the life he now had and believed himself content... at least consciously. Forgotten they may have been but those secret desires to be more, to be better, to be special, remained lurking in the deep recesses of his spirit. Lurking and recognised by the Black Ones as a means to their ends, a foothold into a servant for their cause. And when the opportunity arose, they took it...&nbsp;and Duman!</p>\r\n<p>Duman who stood, trapped in the prison of their making, and trembled with pent up rage as he was forced to admit that even now, after all this time and with all his knowledge and skill still, the power of the A''mathan eluded him. The more he had tried, the more times he failed and the deeper his hatred turned into loathing, until he could not bear even the sound of their name. Tired of wallowing, Duman returned his thoughts to the present. The mark taunted him anew, as did the pride of it written on the face of the image floating in front of him. How many times had he heard Yushok telling them all... </p>\r\n<p>“We bear the mark as a sign of respect and thanks to the Mother for her gift to us?” </p>\r\n<p>"Ha,” snorted Duman. "Fancy words to describe arrogance. Where is your superiority now?" Smug, malignant satisfaction filled the words he threw at the image as time slipped backwards. Words calculated to inflict pain and grief, even though the image before him was incapable of feeling it. </p>\r\n<p>"I did well to rid the world of such conceit. And so much of it,” he laughed sadistically. "How does it feel Yushok...&nbsp;to be last of your kind? To know that you are the reason so many lost their lives? If you hadn''t evaded me for so long, I might have let the others live...&nbsp;for a while anyway,” he jeered, the remembrance of his deeds making him feel a little better. Stepping forward, with centuries of festering hatred in his eyes, he stabbed at the elf’s'' mark with a delicate thrust of a long fingernail. The image began to melt, dripping away like molten wax down the side of a candle. The pleasure he derived from the sight lifted his mood and the fortress sighed in relief when Duman turned back to the window to continue shouting his taunts through the open aperture, across the empty, grey expanse stretching beneath, over the stone causeway and the land beyond and, in his twisted mind, into the face of the A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>"After all these years of fruitless searching, it''s by your own actions you reveal yourself to me. The mighty and elusive Yushok, delivered into my hands by his own. This is too much,” he cried in elation. "Do you not see the irony of it? I always said your sickening concern for others would prove your downfall. You should have heeded my warning." He leant further out of the window and discharged a streak of energy into the cloud above. It thundered and crackled, breaking the beam into tiny shards that erupted everywhere, lighting the skies like a shower of fireworks.</p>\r\n<p>"Soon Yushok...&nbsp;soon, you''ll join your brothers and sisters and the A''mathan and their power shall at last be lost forever." </p>\r\n<p>His laughter was wild and filled with madness.</p>\r\n<p>A little later, having returned to what passed for normality in him, he scribed yet another new order to Hogeth and summoned a messenger to deliver it. Hogeth was to destroy all life &mdash; man and beast, large and small &mdash; in the vicinity of the company once they were found.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s all worked out rather well after all," he mused to the wine swirling around the goblet he lifted to his lips. "The Citog have their fun and I... I shall have the moment I''ve so long awaited. The eradication of the last of the A''mathan! Yes, it has worked out rather well."</p>\r\n<p>Orders on their way, Duman left the tower. As he strolled along the corridors, his long robe sweeping the floor behind him, he reflected upon the experience he had shared with the harpy, more specifically, the shared vision. With some re-configuration of the original spell, he should be able to incorporate this ability within a new creation. It would certainly gain him an advantage and once mastered, he could apply it to all future minions giving him instant access everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ve served me well, as always," he told the absent harpy, his voice echoing down the empty corridors. "Even in death,” He smiled fondly, then promptly forgot all about the harpy as he concentrated on utilizing the recent event, running through a mental list of his compounds and chemicals and filing away a short list of possible combinations that, mixed with the correct incantation (which he would work out later) should produce the desired effect. He also made a mental note for the seizure of a dozen or so humans from the nearest village, deciding that his first attempts might go better using those most compatible to himself. Elfin would have been the ideal subjects, but there was little chance of that while they remained skulking in Phelise. </p>\r\n<p>"Children would probably be best," he advised himself. "More malleable, less resistance. Yes, a dozen children should work out fine," he calculated after assessing the problems he might encounter. While he was more than confident in his skill and ability, he had to acknowledge that the inevitable failures were an occupational hazard and so had to be allowed for. He was sure he could find another use for any left over.</p>\r\n<p>Thus occupied, he did not realise he had arrived at his desired destination until his feet refused to move. He was standing at the top of two, steep flights of stairs, separated by an arched landing that led down to the room in which he practised his spell-casting. The entire length of this corridor, the walls, ceiling and lintels of arch and door, were covered in a maze of inter-connecting runes. They were of the strongest and most powerful he knew, set for the double purpose of both guarding from unauthorized entry and protection against the escape of any energies expelled during casting.</p>\r\n<p>He looked down the first flight of stairs to the landing below. Embedded into the flagstones it was a large square containing four runes. A large V shape took prominence. It’s two upper points beginning in each of the top corners and running down to converge in the centre of the bottom line of the square. Within the middle triangle this created was another rune that, to the untrained eye, appeared as the figure 3. The two halves of a broken circle were set, one in each of the other two triangles, either side of the V. Duman closed his eyes, totally clearing his mind of all unnecessary clutter and drawing his magic into a sharp point of concentration. Slowly he began to descend, projecting his aura in a crackling cloak of blue energy about him. At the bottom he paused momentarily before stepping forward to stand within the lower curve of the figure ''3'', arms stretched out and palms down. The lines demarking the square glowed blood red, as the magic contained therein was activated. Fire flashed down from his palms upon the two half circles. A brief emission of brilliant light preceded the flow of a smoky-black vapour, emanating from the point of the V rune behind him. Duman stood motionless under the twisting coil of living blackness that rose, entrapping him within, allowing it to touch, taste, smell, the authority contained in his aura.</p>\r\n<p>Now was the moment of truth!</p>\r\n<p>As many times as he had stood on this spot, Duman still experienced the flush of dread excitement that this may be the time of his rejection. His whole body tingled with it, though he was careful to keep it under control since any sign of weakness or fear would be his undoing. </p>\r\n<p>Satisfied by both his identity and his authority the vapour receded, dissipating at his feet and resuming its previous inertness. Down the second flight of stairs and Duman stood before the door of his casting room. It resonated to the ''hum'' of the runes cast around it that caused it to throb with a pulsing green hue and made lock or handle unnecessary. Duman raised his hand and the door swung itself open to his mental command.</p>\r\n<p>Glowing embers ensconced in grates set high in the walls provided the chamber with an ambiance that was softly illuminating yet unobtrusive. A mellow light, that had a calming effect and aided his concentration. The two sidewalls were taken up with row upon row of shelves, each one as deep as the wizard’s arm was long. They were brimming with countless jars, bottles and a variety of other containers, every one holding the various liquids, powders, ground metals and elements (as well as other unknown and untold components) necessary to a wizard’s art. Along the opposite wall stood two long tables in juxtaposition, littered with a jumble of books and scrolls containing diagrams, indecipherable scribbling and strange sketches of who only knows what. Ideas that had come, been jotted down, then tossed aside to lay forgotten until something jogged his memory or he had a need of their contents. There were also bowls, dishes, bell-bottomed bottles, measuring spoons of all sizes, plus a myriad of other utensils of glass, metal and wood. There were knives too, of differing shape and various types of edge. Coils of tubing were flung here and there, some hanging from tops of bottles, some still connecting two or more bottles together. And stacked high on the very edge of one table, used and discarded dishes teetered precariously, evidence of Duman’s previous experiments. In the corner next to this table stood a large iron cage covered with fine mesh, where Duman stored the living components of his spells until they were required, while on a stand close by were the horrific looking instruments for use on the unfortunate subject. The purpose and function of these are perhaps best not delved into for sanity’s'' sake and, thankfully, unnecessary since the cage was, at present, unoccupied.</p>\r\n<p>Just off centre of the room; in vast contrast to the disorder of the rest; stood a small, round table neatly prepared for this days'' casting. Several bowls, vials, measuring and mixing utensils had been carefully positioned around a large pestle and mortar made from a skull and arm bone of human origin and directly behind these, in a slightly raised position, lay a large book. Heavily bound in Huri skin, it was blackened by age and leathery in texture. The front was marked with a pentagram bearing a silver triangle in its centre. Duman ran his hand lovingly over its edges before placing his thumb upon the silver plate. A tiny spike shot up drawing blood, which mingled with that from which the pentagram was drawn and together they began to flow. Not until the blood had solidified again did Duman attempt to open the book. Inside were written all of the wizard’s most dangerous and secret spells. Many of the earliest ones were the work of the Huri, the copies of which he had destroyed. The rest of the entries were of his skill and devising. He flicked through them, noting with pride and pleasure the extent to which the latter had matured in complexity and knowledge, requiring a higher degree of skill and mastery of his art to perform them. From somewhere deep, deep inside himself, rose grief and sorrow for the cost of his art: the enormous disregard and loss of innumerable lives that had bought this maturity and, not least, the abandonment of his own spirit. The feeling surprised him for a moment, certain that he had long ago dispensed with such inhibiting sentimentality. Well, he was not about to allow it to resurface now and he clamped his will down, sending it back beyond the confines of his ambition and greed for ultimate power. He shook his head to clear it and turned the pages of the book to his latest entry.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="InsideRunicAkthai" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="" src="InsideRunicAkthai01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>He was well versed in it, having spent many months in its conceiving and perfecting. Still, he ran through it several times, refreshing his memory and focusing his concentration. Moving to his stores he selected four jars. With the touch of his hand and a whispered word they appeared on the table. Two contained white powders, the third a milky, viscous substance and the fourth small, wormlike creatures, not quite as big as his smallest finger, suspended in a murky brown liquid. Using tongs, he removed one and sealed it in a vial. Released from the suspension the worm became active, squirming frenetically inside its new prison. The suckered mouth glued itself onto the glass, revealing ridged teeth and a large proboscis. Duman ran his thumb teasingly over the glass, grinning in delight as the worm went wild. Placing the vial down, he took a careful measure from each of the other jars then sent them back to their places on the shelves.</p>\r\n<p>For a final time, Duman ran through the spell. There was much to be sure of: the correct measures, order of mixing, timing and, most importantly, the perfection of tone and nuance of every word. He thrilled at the knowledge of what he was attempting but he was patently aware of the risks. Not only was this the most complex spell he had ever conceived but also the most dangerous because, for the first time ever, he was using himself as the main component as well as doing the casting. Such was the reason for his zealous caution: his slow, deliberate checking and re-checking that everything was as it should be, in the details and in his mind. Eventually, the moment came. If he did not have it now, he never would. Now, would see the culmination of months of study and practise. Success? Or failure? </p>\r\n<p>The latter did not bear thinking about, for he would not be around to see it. He took several deep breaths letting them out slowly through his mouth, releasing tension and anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning his incantation, he poured the measures of powder together in the pestle, grinding them rhythmically in a specific pattern. They hissed, like cold water spitting in a hot pan and a cloud of smoke billowed upwards. Waiting until it had dispersed, Duman used the combined mixture, which was now black as coal, to mark a large pentagram on the floor. On each of its points he placed a thick, black, rune-scored candle. His incantation changed pitch as he picked up the liquid. To this he added some spittle, a single hair, a piece of nail, and a thread from his robe and, last of all, little drops of his blood. The mixture bubbled vigorously then burst into flame. While it was still burning, he poured equal amounts into the five triangles of the pentagram. It spread out, touching the lines of powder, but it did not cross. He ceased his chanting with a precisely timed pause before raising his arms. Black energy flashed between his palms, ricocheting off every surface of the room and back to its source. The whole room began to buzz with increasing power.</p>\r\n<p>Having thus established his link to his surroundings, Duman started on the second phase of his spell. His voice rose strongly in authoritative command as he lifted the hem of his robe and stepped into the pentagram. He sat down and crossed his legs. Firmly, he called upon the runes inscribed on each candle to release their power for his use. One by one the candles burst into flame, creating an impenetrable field of energy and flame around the wizard that both protected and encaged him.</p>\r\n<p>Again Duman fell silent. Engaging in a virulent inner battle of wills as he gathered together all the separate magic and moulded them into one power under his command. Alone, these were powerful runes... together, they were awesome. The aura surrounding him flared and flickered alternately as the flames from the shield burst inwards toward him, burning his face and sizzling his hair. Buckling beneath the strain, he was saved only by the fact that, jealous of their own power, the force behind each rune chose to attack individually rather than as a unit. First one, then another, came under his control and his own will reigned supreme. But Duman was well aware that it was a fragile reign and he was uncertain as to how long he could retain it. With careful haste he began reciting the differing variations of repetition that were the next stage of his incantations. </p>\r\n<p>For a long while nothing happened and then his ears caught a faint echo that gradually grew stronger and clearer until it had established itself into a distinctly separate voice. Duman took the vial from his pocket and, placing it on the ground beside him, popped the seal. With palms upward he made the gesture to rise. He had scarcely left the floor when resistance set in and he was pulled back down. He raised his hands higher, calling out the command in a loud, powerful tone. He never moved. Out of the corner of his eye he noted that the worm, having wriggled free of the vial, was now making its way toward him. Sweat beaded his brow. Ignoring the flutter in his chest he kept his voice firm and steady as he repeated the command, thrusting his hands forcefully above his head. The resistance yielded and this time he rose easily, if not effortlessly, up and through the energy field, out over the pentagram and slowly settled back down on the floor facing it. It took a great deal of effort to suppress the elation that would have ripped his concentration asunder as he beheld the figure that now sat opposite him. A shadow of himself, it phased in and out of sight with the flickering of the candlelight.</p>\r\n<p>The utterance of the third and final incantation sent the red liquid, hitherto contained in the five triangles, converging upon the shadowy figure that drew it up hungrily; even as it was itself consumed by the greedily sucking proboscis of the feeding worm. When all was complete and only the worm remained, the wizard ceased his chanting. He drew a rune in the air, holding it together with sparkling blue energy, and sent it crashing down upon the pentagram with a wave of his hand. A violent implosion shook the room and afterwards all was gone of the days'' casting save the worm, now safely re-sealed inside the vial.</p>\r\n<p>Duman sagged forward, completely spent. Dust drifted down from the ceiling and settled over him like a blanket. With burning lungs and a pounding heart he gasped for breath. Shaking with reaction, now the immense control he had mastered over it was released, his body became one excruciating pain centred in his head from a mind pummelled in a way completely new to him. Sweat poured copiously from every pore. He tried to lift his hand and wipe it from his eyes but such was his complete exhaustion, he could not even twitch a finger. He had spent countless days training and strengthening the stamina of his mind and body, yet he was still unprepared for the actual amount of physical and mental energy it had drained from him. But underneath the pain and exhaustion that feeling of elation rose again. Such a feat of bending the laws of both nature and physics took an inconceivable effort of skill, strength of will, and absolute concentration and command over inner and outer self. One slip, one mistake in motion, pronunciation or nuance, could have resulted in separating not only his shadow but also his very spirit, leaving his body a lifeless, living corpse. This casting had been the most dangerous and complex he had ever attempted. Had taxed his mind to its very limits and drained his body to the point of death. But he had succeeded! </p>\r\n<p>Had he been able, he would have leapt for joy but right now his immediate and overpowering need, was sleep. His mind slid inwards into the darkness. Deeper than sleep he went, deep into the soothing recesses of the mystical plane where throbbed the heart of his sorcery. Deep into the realms of the Black, where his mind slipped free of its confines and left his body behind and where pain ceased to register. A bemused hush fell over Ak''thai. Duman’s minions, who one might think would be overjoyed, were instead confused and terrified by the sudden and inexplicable withdrawal of his presence &mdash; a presence that usually pulsed through every stone like blood through veins. A presence that was the very life of the fortress, the reason for its being. A presence without which they were nothing, reduced to cowering in the shadows not knowing what to do or what to expect. </p>\r\n<p>In the Summoning chamber the atmosphere was far from sombre. The Melding Orb gleamed brightly, suffusing the room with an almost blinding light as the Dragons converged within, bringing it alive with a maniac swirling of colours entwining, parting and twisting in an interweaving outburst of highly emotional greeting.</p>\r\n<p>"Calm thy selves,” a staid voice tried to settle the others.</p>\r\n<p>"I canst not feel him anywhere." </p>\r\n<p>"What doth it mean?" </p>\r\n<p>"Mayhap he hath expired," a hopeful voice offered.</p>\r\n<p>A burst of renewed swirling broke out.</p>\r\n<p>"QUIET,” the voice of Tareb spoke, again demanding order and this time receiving it. "There! Dost thou feel it? A pulse... ’tis weak and faint, but ''tis there." </p>\r\n<p>Some of the brightness in the Orb faded as the Dragons acknowledged this in disappointment.</p>\r\n<p>"We hath wasted too much time already," continued Tareb. "Soleb, find Yushok." </p>\r\n<p>"Together it wouldst be easier," suggested Soleb.</p>\r\n<p>"The wizard mayest be weak but even so, such unity wouldst undoubtedly attract his attention. We hath already been too careless," Tareb reminded him.</p>\r\n<p>"I grow impatient Tareb," interrupted a restless voice. "I say, we seize this chance and attack now." </p>\r\n<p>"And if we succeed Baroth? What shalt we gain? We knowest not what the results will be. Wilt the Orbs be destroyed and set us free, or shalt we be irrevocably trapped? Mayhap they shalt perish with him upon his death and us also? Wouldst the Orbs even allow us to attack him? And if we shouldst fail? What then? All we hath strived to achieve thus far, little as it may seem, shalt be lost. We shouldst be separated from each other again and next time, be assured, he wilt not be deceived. No brother. I too grow more impatient with the passage of time but we must wait for Ecos. Only with his influence shalt we be strong enough to overcome the wizard and safely delve into his mind for the answer to our freedom. Events art moving closer. The joining completed. Soon Baroth, soon now shalt we be triumphant, if we canst only remain calm and undetected." </p>\r\n<p>"I bow to thy wisdom," Baroth acquiesced in pastel shades.</p>\r\n<p>"I disagree,” cried a surly voice. "We shouldst accept the risk and grasp this opportunity. We shalt not get better." </p>\r\n<p>"Ah! Felnath! Thou art young and impetuous," sighed Tareb. "Long hath we waited... canst thou not wait a little longer?" </p>\r\n<p>"Wait for what? Wait for a hopeless dream? Tareb, thou doth misplace our hopes and future upon this mere slip of a girl. Ecos, in all his power wast no match for Duman as a novice, what hope now for a human possessing only half his power? Duman is no longer a novice but a Master of his Art. Who knowest better than we, the extent of his strength and skill? He wilt destroy her in the blink of an eye! So, Tareb... Wise One, tell me... What hope is there?" </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, the Orb stood ablaze in gold and a commanding voice spoke in tones tinged with bitter anger.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I didst stand alone, Felnath. Or hath thou forgotten?"</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos!"&nbsp;The brothers exclaimed in unison, colours mingling tightly as they greeted him.</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos. Forgive me," whispered Felnath, shamed by the reprimand since he knew the truth in it.</p>\r\n<p>"Silence,” ordered Ecos. "I hath little time. My presence here bringeth peril to all." His voice softened as he continued. "My heart doth sorely grieve for thee, brothers, and to leave thee here. But be patient and take heart. Harken unto my words... mayhap thou wilt not understand now but at the right time thou wilt knowest the truth of them. The Chosen hath Power. Much Power. Of Father and Mother both. Less than each but greater as One." </p>\r\n<p>"Thou makest no sense brother," Tareb spoke for the four. "Tell us plain of what thou speaketh!" </p>\r\n<p>The brothers'' demand remained unanswered, for Ecos was already gone.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, Felnath?" asked Baroth. "What sayest thee now?" </p>\r\n<p>"We wait." </p>\r\n<p>"But not here," advised Tareb hastily. "His presence doth rise from its sleep. We hath much to ponder whilst we art apart. Hold Ecos'' words unto thine heart young Felnath and take care." </p>\r\n<p>Far below in the Casting Room, Duman stretched cramped limbs, yawning widely and sucking in deep breaths. He picked up the vial still lying beside him, turning it over in his hand as he rose. The fortress sighed in relief as his renewed energy throbbed once more through the stone. A broad grin split his flushed face. He felt good! He secreted the vial inside his robe and left the room to return to his quarters for sustenance and more natural sleep. The hard part was over and though it was tempting to finish his task and cast his second spell, he was wiser than he was eager. </p>\r\n<p>His common sense acknowledged he was really still too weak to do so safely. </p>\r\n<p>It was a light step that trod the corridors of Ak''thai, pleased with the days'' success and anticipating greater to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nCenturies hidden from evils'' hand\r\n<br>Dragon’s Power waiting,\r\n<br>In silent, watchful solitude,\r\n<br>Safe in amber casing.\r\n<br>Until at last, into its depths\r\n<br>Of swirling wonder gazed\r\n<br>And thus the mortal child was lost\r\n<br>And Powerwielder raised!\r\n<br>Excerpt from\r\n<br>''Alyse’s Song''\r\n<br>(Tenora.

(20, 'The Awakening', 'CHAPTER EIGHT', '<br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="C" src="C.gif">ymon’s voice faded away. The needle slipped from her numb fingers and stabbed searing pain into her right eye. Alyse screamed, clawing at her face to pull it out. And then she was lost. She was lost in an abyss of absolute blackness &mdash; a total deprivation of her senses. She could see nothing; hear, smell, touch; nothing. She had no substance. No being. Somewhere out there, she could sense the presence of Jarok. Willing her to come back to him. But come back from where? She tried to reach out to him, to speak his name but it was useless. She had no idea where she was or how she had gotten there. Worse, she had no idea how to get out. Alone, hanging helpless in a void of despair, the unknown gave birth to terror, which in turn bred panic and she screamed voicelessly for help. Out of the darkness, a soft glow came drifting towards her. Threads of sparkling gold reached out to enfold her as it approached, wrapping themselves around her and frightening her even more as they tightened purposefully. Not understanding what was happening she struggled to free herself from their grip. They made no effort to force her. Instead they released her and retreated, leaving her once again alone in darkness that seemed blacker than before. She lost awareness even of that.<p></p>\r\n<p>Awareness returned and with it the light. Once more it drifted towards her, delicate threads flowing out in greeting. This time they coiled loosely, stroking and soothing her bruised psyche. Bathing her in warm reassurance and alleviating her fears, so that she allowed herself to relax into their comforting presence. As the golden strands thickened, they covered the emptiness where her body should have been and the golden shape of it emphasized the nothingness within. Fear returned with a vengeance and she recoiled once again into the blackness.</p>\r\n<p>For what seemed an eternity she remained alone in the dark. It began to press in on her, threatening to overwhelm her and erase the little of her that was left. The pressure increased, making her fear of it stronger than her fear of the light. Again her soft voice called out, now begging the light to return. It appeared immediately, pulsing faintly in the distance. Relief flooded her, until she realised it remained motionless. Its presence, so vivid and yet so far out of reach, heightened her helpless isolation. She moved toward it. It maintained its distance.</p>\r\n<p>"Please! Don''t leave me alone. I need your help."</p>\r\n<p>She sent the thought spinning off across the void. In an instant the light was beside her and for a third time, the coils of golden light wrapped around her. This time she welcomed them. Embraced them without reservation as they pulled her into the source of their Being. Watched in awed fascination as separate coils weaved themselves together to form muscles and sinew upon golden-hued bones. Molten power flowed through throbbing, golden veins like blood, creating substance around her awareness. She breathed deeply into regenerated lungs, filling them with life that tasted like no other. She felt renewed. Revitalized. Pulsing with untapped energy. She felt...&nbsp;Alive!</p>\r\n<p>Memories of places she had never been filled her mind. Languages she had never spoken. People she had never met. Things she had never done. She experienced deep, passionate emotions all linked to these memories. She knew the ecstasy of this entity’s birth, its joy of life, its pain of betrayal, and its hopes for what might be. A memory of her parents surprised her and brought her pain and anguish but it was soothed away by a deep respect akin to love, loss for their passing, and immense gratitude for their sacrifice that was also embedded there. Intense joy at the birth of her brother swamped her and boundless thanksgiving for his safety on the night the Citog took her mother.</p>\r\n<p>She knew the ecstasy of flight and of being one with the Earth. </p>\r\n<p>And she knew intense hatred for the Dark Elf...&nbsp;Duman!</p>\r\n<p>All these and more, washed over her, embedding into the very essence of her being. But this flow of memories, this exchange of essence, was not one-sided. The golden entity absorbed her own and with each shared memory and emotion, the two separate entities that they were became inextricably entwined. Growing stronger with every heartbeat, they merged into singularity and at that moment of singleness the remaining globe of light exploded into millions upon millions of specks of gold. Outward they flew until they could barely be seen. Tiny golden sprinkles flickering delicately in the darkness of her psyche...&nbsp;and then they were all about her and settling over her newly formed body in a golden skin, dispelling the darkness with the beauteous intensity of her shimmering radiance.</p>\r\n<p>Head thrown back, hair billowing outwards in a rippling banner of silken waves, she threw open her arms.</p>\r\n<p>"IT IS DONE!"</p>\r\n<p>Two voices echoed each other across the great void: the voices of Alyse and Ecos.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Ecos" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Ecos" src="Ecos01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>"WE ARE ONE!" </p>\r\n<p>A single voice cried back. A young, soft voice enriched with deep, ancient tones.</p>\r\n<p>The voice of the Joined!</p>\r\n<p>The joining was done but it was not complete and so outwardly, Alyse’s body remained in its trance-like state while she acquired the knowledge and understanding of what it meant to have and use the Power now part of her. For though they shared all, her thought processes were none the less mortal and her mind as a single breath, in the vast expanse of space that was Ecos''. She needed time to assimilate the immensity of all that he was and contained, into the smallness that was Alyse, to learn how to think his thoughts in her way. Otherwise her psyche would overload and be destroyed. She found it strange and disorientating at first, to hear another voice in her head &mdash; a voice that was her own, yet it was not. Confusing, as she asked questions, only to answer them herself! Sometimes she thought she was simply going mad...&nbsp;it was said that talking to oneself was the first sign of a softening of the brain! But gradually, she became accustomed to this new dimension of her being, this paradox of dual singularity that she now was, and her education, though somewhat limited due to the necessity of it being all theory and no practise, progressed swiftly. She had not wanted it this way but was forced to accept the reasoning behind it... that practise would make it too dangerous for all of them, out here where Duman could reach them. Only in Phelise, said the older, wiser voice, would it be safe to begin her practical application.</p>\r\n<p>Through images and questioning alone therefore, she was instructed how to draw upon the power, focus its direction and intent according to her will, and then to release it to its assigned task. The notion that she was both power and conduit she found confusing at first, until she mastered the concept of conscious separation of the inner and outer self of her altered state. She discovered the ability to enhance characteristics, emotions, or natural occurrences but she also learnt she could not create something that was not already there.</p>\r\n<p>The Power itself was neutral. Neither good nor bad, though it did contain an element of Draconian personality and experiences. It was the will that applied it that defined its intent. Thus it was shaped according to the nature of the being wherein it existed. Even though her own portion was but a small remnant of the enormity that was originally Ecos, it was nonetheless awesome by any human standard. The destructive potential of it filled her with terror and she was horrified by the vivid images of the consequences of unrestrained unleashing of it by overcharged emotionalism, especially those negative forces such as hatred and anger. It was with great relief and thanksgiving therefore, that she discovered her own innate abhorrence of violence and suffering imposed its own natural limitations... to a certain extent. As with most things, she was instructed, there were exceptions to every rule and she must always remain in constant awareness of this. </p>\r\n<p>The key was control &mdash; rigid and total. She must, at all times, be in control, be controlled, and be the controller. To one half of her it seemed an impossible task. </p>\r\n<p>The other half assured her that in time it would become as natural to her as breathing. Her complete surrender and acceptance of her fate, coupled with her strong will and eager-to- learn mind, accelerated the learning process, so that she was ready (at least in theorized technique) far sooner than those who had precipitated the event could have expected. All that remained now was practical application, to hone her knowledge into skill and build her confidence. Her chance came out of nowhere and took her completely by surprise. Without warning she found herself swept away by a tidal wave of horror, pain, suffering and death. Swamped in a mire of agony as the cries of endless, innocent victims lay siege to her mind and spirit. Pleas for help and justice, that had lain unheard for so long they were now twisted screams for death and revenge, ripped apart her unguarded psyche with a velocity and intensity she was unprepared and unable to defend against. Like a roaring fire, Power surged in response as her own emotions were caught up in the flood. Flashes of warning broke through the raging storm that beset her. </p>\r\n<p>Control or Consequence!</p>\r\n<p>Fastening her will upon the Power surging up in her, she forced it back within the constraints of her control but in her panic she over-compensated, blocking off all access and mentally split herself in two! Like a newborn baby without its mother, she was lost, helpless and alone &mdash; more alone than she could ever remember. Vulnerable and defenceless, she was completely at the mercy of whatever was out there. In terrified desperation she retreated back into the blackness, where her journey had begun.</p>\r\n<p>"Please, I cannot bear any more," she cried. "Where are you? Please. Help me!" </p>\r\n<p>There was no answer. The assault continued, gaining in strength and clamour.</p>\r\n<p>"You are here...&nbsp;I know you are here. Why will you not answer me?" she screamed as she frantically searched the black expanse. Crushed beneath the over-powering onslaught, she had lost sight of the fact that she herself was the help she sought and that it was herself that withheld it.</p>\r\n<p>"I trusted you,” she screamed accusingly. "I gave myself to you!" </p>\r\n<p>The blackness writhed around her as the tormented spirits who pursued her reached out; pleading, beseeching, demanding; with centuries-old, unreleased suffering, to be freed into the arms of the Mother where they belonged. Lost in their own anguish, they were oblivious to the distress and damage they were causing with their relentless violation of her sensitised, inexperienced and fragile mind. All they knew and cared about was that, at last, they had found someone who could hear their cries and so with selfish lack of pity, pursued her.</p>\r\n<p>She had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. She was trapped! Her hands tore at the air, trying to rip open an avenue of escape in the fabric of pain that engulfed her. Suddenly she found it, only to have it torn from her again. She sensed it still close and flailed wildly until her fingers closed about it and clasped it firmly to her. The turbulent tide ebbed away. Not gone, but distanced, as if a wall had been built between them. As the worst of the assault subsided to a tolerable level, her senses returned to equilibrium. </p>\r\n<p>The mental grip she had maintained relaxed and that which she had severed returned. Elation at being whole once more turned to ashamed awareness and self-anger that she had failed miserably. Her first test had proved an utter disaster!</p>\r\n<p>"Error is the process by which we mature," she heard herself say. "Thy decision wast valid and thou hast proven thine ability to maintain control admirably. Even in thine fear thou didst refuse to risk the consequences." </p>\r\n<p>"Rubbish,” she scoffed at herself. "You make it sound as though I planned it such. That I made some noble action rather than allow the Power freedom, when the fact is I panicked and made a complete mess of everything." </p>\r\n<p>"Thy will is strong, thine only error wast misjudgement of thine strength. As long as thou learnest by this thou hath no need of self-recrimination,” advised her other self.</p>\r\n<p>Reviewing the event, Alyse acknowledged the truth of this. Still, she would not excuse herself. With typical determination she vowed it to be her first... and last... failure. A wave of approval washed over her. At least she had passed one test this day! </p>\r\n<p>Calmer and more self-assured, Alyse gently probed the barriers that now held the confusion at bay, seeking some sense of it. With grief she found that it contained what remained of those who once lived here, now forced into a limbo of reliving their torturous deaths and that of their beloved homeland. Cursed never to know the joy and peace that is the birthright of every living thing... to return to the Mother. Damned to cry for eternity into an empty, un answering abyss devoid of everything save the malicious renderings of their demonic tormentors, until one by one, bitterly twisted by deprived hope and despair, they were barely recognisable as the gentle spirits they had once been. Eventually they would all become a part of the evil they despised. Her sorrow was compounded by the knowledge that at present, she could do nothing to alleviate their suffering. Perhaps, if she survived, then someday she would return. She tried to convey this message to them, to give them some measure of hope but she doubted they heard her above their own howling anguish.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse resumed her education whilst maintaining a constant guard on her newly created barriers. Suddenly she detected a subtle change in the pressure that leaned in upon her. Like the rest, it was a strong push, demanding access. Yet this one remained respectfully patient, despite the sense of urgency it carried. Guardedly, she allowed it in.</p>\r\n<p>"A''ma Alyse. Cy ñya n ås''rûeh,” a voice cried.</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok! It hath been a long time," one part of her greeted the voice warmly. "What ails the Elf that thou needs must disturb me?" "Sûlac amû y''sièn! The demons of the Mornay, My Lady, they almost have him. He is too far-gone for myself to reach. You are his only hope!" </p>\r\n<p>"Do what you can Yushok. I am coming," Alyse replied without hesitation and was immediately inundated by a multitude of arguments and protestations. </p>\r\n<p>"The decision is made,” she stated firmly and brooking no refusal. </p>\r\n<p>Focusing her concentration on the pulsing beat of her heart, Alyse retracted her psyche from the limitless expanse of the astral plane in which it rested, into the limited confines of her body. It took her a moment to adjust to the claustrophobic restrictions it imposed on her. When she opened her eyes, she saw Jarok lying beside her, sick and weak. She placed his pouch against his chest, tucking his fingers around it. She nodded. He would be safe enough for the present. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon however was another matter. She found him lying on the ground with</p>\r\n<p>Defiant and Royle in close attendance. His skin was grey... cold, despite the heat of the burning sun. The blue tinge upon his lips bespoke the kiss of death and the stiffness of his body that she was too late and his spirit had already left. Beside him lay the body of the harpy, empty eyes staring into his face. She pushed it aside in disgust, noting with satisfaction the way it crumpled into dust at her touch. Placing her hand on Cymon’s brow she could sense the evil swarming over him, like ants over a sugar bowl. Closing her eyes she raised an image of him in her mind and called out to it, urging him to fight. But it was not enough. The response was feeble and getting weaker, whilst the demonic pressure increased, surging in anticipation of imminent victory.</p>\r\n<p>"NEVER!" </p>\r\n<p>Her determined cry sliced across the deserts'' silence on the back of Defiant’s screaming challenge. Royale’s hackles rose in reaction to the wave of anger that emanated from them both and his back arched as he spat and hissed at the invisible enemy.</p>\r\n<p>Ignoring the outside influences and disregarding all the inner objections and warnings that bombarded her, Alyse tightened the barriers around herself, knowing in her heart that what she proposed to do was Cymon’s only hope. With a mental deep breath she clasped her anger to her own will and purpose, channelling it to constructive decision and action, bending it and controlling it, in order to draw from it the confidence and strength necessary to fulfil her plan. She placed her two thumbs in the middle of Cymon’s forehead, spreading her fingers across his temples and down to the soft, tender spot just behind his ears. Cymon’s head started to twitch as she applied a gentle pressure. The air about them began to shimmer and sparkle; minute particles of Power escaping into the atmosphere despite the rigidity of her control; as she erected a golden shell around them both to shield and conceal them. Once it was in place she loosed her psyche onto the astral dimensions, concentrating on Cymon as she did so and allowing herself to be pulled in the direction of where his plane of existence crossed hers.</p>\r\n<p>Each plane was separated from the other by an intricately woven, translucent veil so delicate it allowed kindred spirits almost to touch yet, (under normal circumstances) was infinitely strong in order to maintain individuality, allow privacy and preserve sanity. She paused before that which separated Cymon’s from her own. Cries of no, followed her but she pushed them away and planted her hands gently upon the veil. Focusing energy into her spiritual fingertips, Alyse burnt a thin strip of the veil away and stepped through.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the physical world, her body broke into muscular spasms and she took a deep, shuddering breath as she locked her grip upon Cymon’s head while her spiritual self trespassed deeper into his astral abode with growing dread. It seemed dark and lifeless but she kept going, even though she knew that the nearer she went to the essence of his spirit and the longer she stayed, the more dangerous it became for Cymon. He was still here somewhere. She was positive of that, and she was not leaving until he was safe. And if that meant outright invasion of his essence...&nbsp;then so be it, she vowed. </p>\r\n<p>So deeper and deeper she probed, weaving her way through the ever-thickening mass of hideously warped, demonic forms. She could sense the dripping decay of their skulking malevolence, oozing and seeping its poison across the astral floor. The depth of it’s evil sickened her. And for a moment she wavered, not wanting to go anywhere near it. Then she spied the faintest of glows and her resolve strengthened. </p>\r\n<p>Cautiously resuming her advance she allowed the evil to flow over, knowing she dare not reveal herself too soon lest the demons make their final thrust before she arrived. In the waning light of his failing spirit she saw the definition of the grossly deformed shapes pawing over him in gruesome dances of jubilation, celebrating their perceived victory. So intent were they, that they remained ignorant of her presence until fierce, golden light sliced through their ranks. This was an entity they had never encountered before and as it cut into their world of darkness they recoiled. Shrieking in terror of the pure Power slicing through them they retreated further and further, with Alyse pursuing them until they disappeared back from whence they came. </p>\r\n<p>Having satisfied herself that all had been banished, Alyse sealed the gaps they had rent in the veil adding an extra reinforcement of her own now-powerful psyche that would surpass anything they could hope to summon. Simultaneously, Alyse drove a shaft of amber down to the spluttering remains of the flame of Cymon’s spirit. Plucking it up and suffusing it with Power to fuel its feeble flickering until it shone bright and steady, filling the dark void like summer sunshine. The Elfin delicacy of it held a sweet aroma that struck chords of joy and wonder tinged with sadness and great loss. She savoured the beauty of it for a moment, and then withdrew.</p>\r\n<p>"Thine actions wert reckless and dangerous,” the waiting voice admonished, immediately her link with Cymon was broken.</p>\r\n<p>"They were necessary,” she countered.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou couldst hath killed him." </p>\r\n<p>"Better dead than the fate that otherwise awaited him," she retorted angrily. "I will argue with you no more! There are more important things demanding my attention than justifying myself to you. Be quiet and allow me to do what needs to be done." </p>\r\n<p>Leaving Cymon under the watchful eye of Defiant, Alyse knelt beside the injured roan. It too was near death, the tortured gasps that wheezed scant air into its lungs only prolonging its agony. Alyse felt a flush of elation. Only a few, short weeks ago she would have been unable to help it, other than to put it out of its misery... but now!</p>\r\n<p>"Be still," she whispered softly, as pain-glazed eyes struggled to open at her touch. Keeping her left hand steady above the horses’ head, she spread out her right hand and traced the contours of the animals'' body. Amber flame burst from her palm covering the horse like a second skin. It did not burn, but flashed in ripples of healing as it seared through broken bone, torn muscle and infected blood. Amber turned green, then yellow, then red, until finally; as the last sores were cleansed and closed; it pulsed once more deep, rich amber. </p>\r\n<p>Reluctant at first the horse shifted its weight and pulled its legs beneath it and responded to Alyse’s urge to rise. Gingerly placing its hooves down it moved forward then realising there was no pain, engaged in a wild moment of bucking and kicking before trotting back to stand obediently next to Alyse. She stroked its now gleaming coat, her hand pausing on its chest as she encountered the rhythmic beating of its heart. She turned her ear inward locating her own, steady pulse and gradually the two began to synchronize. When they beat as one, Alyse allowed a measure of Power to transfer from heart to heart with each pulse, enhancing the horses'' natural stamina, strength and speed. The roan tossed its head as its muscles rippled with this strange new energy that was raw and powerful. It neighed with exhilaration as the Power delivered into it tinted its rich, brown eyes in amber hue. Alyse gave as much as she dared before severing contact. She feared the animal would need every ounce and more before this day was done. Already she sensed a change in the air. Full of life and more, the roan pawed at the ground impatient for action.</p>\r\n<p>"Soon, my child," she promised, rubbing its muzzle. "Soon."</p>\r\n<p>In like manner Alyse tended to its brother and to Defiant, then, after packing and saddling the horses ready, she climbed back into the wagon to tend to Jarok. As she gazed upon him, curled up on his side cuddling his pouch close to his chest, her thoughts and heart grew heavy. He was so young, so innocent. If he came to harm, how should she bear it? She wanted to hide him away somewhere, away from all the dangers that loomed threateningly on the horizon. But she knew this was not possible. What had begun must be completed.</p>\r\n<p>"But Mother, he is so young,” she cried, tears rolling down her cheeks as she leant forward to kiss his face. "Little brother," she whispered close to his ear. "So much has changed, for us and for the world. And so much more yet will. Shall those eyes still look at me the same? Shall I still see the brother I knew, through these eyes that now see too much? Would that I could turn back the days, to that time of happy ignorance. But Destiny has blown her horn and her summons cannot be ignored." </p>\r\n<p>Her eyes drifted far into the distance, seeking the elusive future whose demands set in motion the events of the past and whose insatiable greed to ''be'', ravenously consumed the present. The road ahead disappeared into a blinding fog. Her hand drifted to the sweat-soaked hair of her brother and slowly stroked it back off his ravaged face with sorrowful tenderness. </p>\r\n<p>"I love you Jarok."</p>\r\n<p>A soft purr interrupted her melancholy, reminding her of their predicament.</p>\r\n<p>"You are right," she said briskly. "Time is too precious to waste in self-indulgence."</p>\r\n<p>She ran quick, healing hands across Jarok’s battered body and mind and when she was satisfied all damage had been repaired, a slight mental nudge had his eyelids flickering open.</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse? Is that really you or am I dreaming?" he cried and flung himself into her open arms.</p>\r\n<p>"No, Jarok, you are not dreaming," she replied, hugging him fiercely as though she would never let him go again.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''ve been dreaming?" he asked hopefully as memory flooded back.</p>\r\n<p>"No, my dearest. Everything you remember is real." she answered. For a moment she felt his body sag. Then he turned bright eyes upward.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t care! You''re back now and nothing else matters. I was so scared for you." He began to cry. "Please...&nbsp;don’t leave me again."</p>\r\n<p>She did not answer straightaway, knowing she could not promise him this. She held his chin and gazed deep into his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"None of us knows what the future might hold, Jarok. I will not make you a promise I may not be able to keep. But I give you my word that as far as it is within my power, I shall not leave you again."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok stared at her, sensing something different about her and her words definitely held more than they told but he accepted them, as the silent plea in her eyes asked him to, and buried his head once more in her embrace.</p>\r\n<p>By now, Cymon had also awakened to her gentle urging. Hearing Alyse’s voice something stirred within him. His brow furrowed deeply as he tried to hold onto it. In his mind it was as though a light flashed on and off, illuminating briefly a vision of horror and revulsion, of terror and inevitability overcome by a powerful touch of love and strength. For an instant it was vividly alive but, as all dreams fade with wakefulness, it refused to stay no matter how hard he tried and he was left with only a great sense of well being. </p>\r\n<p>Defiant called to him and he jumped up, turning joyfully to greet his friend whom he thought he had lost. To his amazement all three horses stood, packed and ready to travel. He walked over to them, running puzzled hands over their bodies. None bore any signs of their wounds and they looked as fit and fresh as he had ever seen them. Only then did he notice that his own injuries were also gone. He flexed his left hand. It was perfectly healthy. No trace of the earlier infection remained and even the cut he had made in the palm was healed without even a scar to show for it. He heard the wagon creak and turned to see Jarok jumping down, followed by Alyse and he hurried over to join them. Jarok’s tear-stained face was split from ear to ear in an enormous grin.</p>\r\n<p>"Isn''t it marvellous?" he cried, swinging Alyse’s hand wrapped around his. "Everything''s going to be alright now, you''ll see. We can all go to Phelise and live happily ever after,” Jarok’s tongue was tripping over itself to release all the pent up emotions he had carried since Alyse’s collapse. Cymon was glad of it, for it masked his own speechlessness as he stared at Alyse unsure of what to do or say. What he wanted to do was to sweep her into his arms, to hold her tightly. Stroke her hair. Kiss her eyes, her nose and linger upon her lips. Tell her how scared he had been that he had lost her and to whoop with joy that he had not. Instead he smiled stupidly and very politely said it was good to see her awake again. She thanked him, just as politely then bent down beside Jarok who was tugging at her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"I am sorry Jarok. We will talk later, I promise." She smiled and kissed his cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"But... " </p>\r\n<p>"No doubt Cymon has questions too," she cupped Jarok’s chin and closed his mouth gently. "But for now, time is of the essence and I must crave your indulgence and ask you both for patience. Sufficed to say I am here... but not as I once was." She sighed deeply as they stared at her blankly. "I wanted the chance to try and explain some things to you both first, however... " She let the Power flow.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon and Jarok stood transfixed as she became infused with a burnished-gold iridescence. Moonlight struck amber tints in her hair and laced through the energy-charged strands that played delicately across features sparkling with a translucent ethereal beauty. When she blinked, inner lids slid open crossways, revealing pools of liquid amber that flowed with unfathomable depths of ancient wisdom and knowledge. Elf and boy were awestruck as Alyse was lost in the preternatural transformation, leaving behind a wondrous apparition of effulgent light &mdash; a vision that transcended beauty and perfection, sister and Beloved no more, but some unknown wraith of mystical origin.</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse?" Jarok whispered uncertainly, grabbing Cymon’s arm. Cymon himself could not move. He was spellbound. Held by the call of the living amber upon his heart and spirit, as though it were a part of him and he of it. He remembered its touch upon the essence of his mortality, which now cried out in response, as a lost and lonely child begging to return home. Then she blinked again, breaking the spell, and he was left wondering if he had not just imagined it all as Alyse stood before him in dusty, oversized shirt and trousers, with her woman-child face and pale hair pulled over one shoulder in a single braid. Her voice however retained deep, commanding authority that evolved not from this world and though it did not use the same ancient speech he recalled, neither did it use the same, often abbreviated speech as before. It was a strange mixture of the two.</p>\r\n<p>"I have restored your health with the gifts I now posses. However, my use of the Power is as yet raw and will have alerted Duman as surely as night follows day. It has taken some time to perform these tasks and already the air thickens. We must move as swiftly as we can." </p>\r\n<p>They had scarcely settled themselves, than the animals leapt into a ground-eating gallop. The sun poured its scorching heat onto the Mornay &mdash; heat that should have drained their strength and sapped their stamina. Heat that only yesterday would have had them crawling along at a plodding walk. Yet today the horses continued their incredible pace undeterred. Ears pricked, hooves thrumming, they showed no signs of tiredness or distress. Neither did Jarok, Cymon noted as he gazed across at the boy bent low over the roans'' neck and realised to his amazement that he himself could barely feel the cruel heat of the sun and what warmth there was, was swept away in the breeze created by the galloping horses. In fact, had it not been for the unchanged desolation of the landscape, he may have been deceived into thinking they were not in the Mornay at all! </p>\r\n<p>Still, despite any evidence of their faltering, Cymon grew increasingly concerned about the welfare of the horses. Surely they could not keep this up without killing themselves? As though she had heard his thoughts, Alyse suddenly called a halt. They dismounted and Cymon ran his hands over the horses to check their condition, noting with uneasy bewilderment, the unnatural lack of sweat and the fact that they were hardly blowing from their incredible exertions. He jumped as a hand touched his arm.</p>\r\n<p>"They are fine, please do not worry. Trust me when I say, I have prepared them for this. I would not ask them to do anything that would cause them harm. But still, a drink of water would not go amiss." Alyse smiled warmly. All his doubts and concerns melted away and he returned her smile fondly. She touched his arm again, letting her hand linger a moment, then walked away, leaving him and Jarok to tend to the horses'' needs.</p>\r\n<p>"What d''you suppose happened to her? I mean... " Jarok paused and kicked at the dusty ground with his toe. "I don''t really know what I mean," he finished confusedly watching Alyse where she stood, several paces off to their right, motionless as a statue within the golden glow that once again encompassed her. Cymon tore his eyes away and dropped down on one knee beside Jarok whose question, the elf recognised, was more a plea for reassurance that this being was still his beloved sister, than it was a curious inquiry. </p>\r\n<p>"Jarok, I can''t answer your questions, any more than I can answer my own," he said honestly. "Anything I did say would be mere supposition...&nbsp;and isn''t that how I got us into this mess in the first place?" Cymon’s voice was thick with self-accusation and remorse. "Best we wait until she has the time to tell us herself," he advised them both.</p>\r\n<p>"I guess," Jarok accepted the advice but his bottom lip began to tremble as his eyes narrowed again on Alyse. "I''m just scared Cymon. She''s so... different. What if..."</p>\r\n<p>"You can''t live on ''ifs''." Cymon put one hand on Jarok’s shoulder and stroked the hair back off his face with the other. "Obviously this ''Power'' has changed her. But underneath, she''s still Alyse and always will be. Whatever else she''s become we must only be thankful for it because otherwise we wouldn''t be standing here now. All you have to remember is that she loves you deeply, with a love strong enough to wake her when you were in danger. Isn''t that all that really matters?" he asked and felt the tension slip away from Jarok’s taut frame. He ventured to add: “One thing to remember, she''s only as different as we treat her!” Leaving him to mull this thought over, Cymon rose and went to water the horses.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Alyse was busy searching. Even after dismissing the frustrated mumblings of the demons that retaliated by blowing the dust around her ankles she still had a sense of evil lurking both behind and beyond that left her confused. She knew the wizard was on the move...&nbsp;but from where? </p>\r\n<p>Surely even he could not be in two directions at once. She reached out further seeking positive identification. Suddenly, a force of enormous magnitude slammed into her, causing her heart to pound and nearly knocking her off her feet physically and mentally. Her head jerked back with a snap and she recoiled swiftly, throwing up her barriers behind her. Her head was buzzing and throbbing violently but she had her answer. </p>\r\n<p>"Are you alright?" asked Cymon taking one look at her ashen face as she ran towards them and grabbing her around the waist, afraid that she was about to pass out on them again.</p>\r\n<p>"I am fine," she assured them both. "It just took me by surprise is all. We must hurry! Duman rouses and he commands the demons here to give physical expression to his presence. We must reach the border where these forces cannot pass."</p>\r\n<p>Even as she spoke, the manifestation appeared: a heavy, brooding cloud darkening the eastern sky. Like boiling liquid it bubbled and flowed, belching inky blackness out from the interior to dance caressingly over the paler, outer edges before curling up and around itself to be drawn back in. Continuously turning itself inside out, the cloud oozed across the sky. Gaining momentum along the way, the outer edges of the cloud began to rotate, spinning faster towards the core and drawing it down to the swirling dust spiralling in eerie grace up from the ground to join it. From a distance it was not so much frightening as captivating, the rhythmic fluidity of its motion having an hypnotic effect on Jarok so that Cymon had to physically turn him around by his shoulders.</p>\r\n<p>"Hurry!" Alyse cried urgently. "Speed is our only ally."</p>\r\n<p>Ignoring all other dangers, they pointed the horses west and set them at a furious gallop. The horses needed no second urging, responding with all their strength, hooves barely clipping the ground as they raced at breakneck speed over the desert.</p>\r\n<p>The swirling vortex at their backs grew steadily wider, feeding upon the dust and debris sucked up by the spinning maw. At first it snaked back and forth, reminiscent of a bloodhound fixing the scent, until a boom of thunder sent it twisting its way inexorably in their direction. Huge rocks and boulders, lifted effortlessly by the powerful force, danced in the grey air if no more substantial than a feather. Cymon chanced a quick look over his shoulder and thought he spotted the discarded wagon bobbing and weaving amongst them. One thing he was sure of, it was getting closer! Moving at phenomenal speed, the stinging touch of the leading edge of the swirling enemy was soon tugging at their hair and clothes. Cymon shouted at the others to get rid of all their surplus belongings, to minimise the dragging effect of the intensifying wind. The howling screech of the wind was accentuated by resounding claps of thunder as jagged sheets of lightning streaked through the ominous cloud, doing less to illuminate it than to enhance its inherent blackness. On the periphery of the savaging wind rose a crescendo of jubilant undertones. Demonical laughter, taunting and threatening with maniacal glee as smaller dust devils sprang up to the sides of them, creating crosswinds to buffet them from all directions. Eddies of air, swirling around the horses’ legs like invisible hands, trying to unbalance and trip them. The company rode close together, alternating their positions so that each horse had a spell of being shielded from the worst effects. Much of the time they ran blindly, through choking clouds of dust blown out and upward until another swirl cleared it away, only for it to return. The horses battled with all their might to remain ahead of the chasing threat behind. </p>\r\n<p>Debris flung out by the main vortex landed in an explosion of earth that left deep craters in the quaking ground. Interspersed between these bombardments came colossal bursts of energy, exploding from sky to earth and splitting it wide open, marking their flight with a trail of deep chasms. Vivid scars, prominent and raw, that pierced with stark intensity, this land already scarred too much and as the wizard persisted his assault, from somewhere far below the surface, a low resonant objection issued forth. Faint and tremulous as it was, Alyse nonetheless recognised the transient notes of rebellion. An idea began to form but was temporarily lost in the necessity of calming the shying dance of her mount as ear-splitting thunder rumbled overhead in waves of black vapour. </p>\r\n<p>As the cloud loomed closer they were bathed in eerie, green light. Not the vivid, healthy green of flora but the nauseating green of infection, as if the very air was sick. Jarok closed his eyes against it, swallowing bile as his face turned the same sickly colour. Cymon edged Defiant closer; fearful the boy was about to pass out and to be ready to grab him if he did. He was surprised that her brothers'' condition seemed to have gone unnoticed by Alyse, who until this point had kept a very watchful eye on him. As it happened, Alyse was struggling desperately with a predicament of her own at that moment.</p>\r\n<p>"Felnath!" </p>\r\n<p>The soft, anguished whisper echoed through the chambers of her mind, threatening to engulf her.</p>\r\n<p>"Control! Control,” she muttered, over and over as her vision darkened alarmingly. She could not afford to lose it now...&nbsp;and clenched her teeth over her tongue, using the pain to keep her in the present. Blood trickled unheeded down her chin. Reaching out she felt for the connection she had established with Cymon, seeking his support and strength. What she found were his concerns for her brother and it was these that returned her to herself. Her will surged anew, over-riding all else and bringing order to her disordered mind. She edged close to Jarok’s other side.</p>\r\n<p>Even with the enhancement she had supplied, the horses were by now beginning to tire under the violent winds that pushed, pulled and buffeted them against one another while their riders hung on grimly. Galloping wither deep through cleaving mire may have proved easier than battling against the increasing pressure surrounding them but, tired as they were, they refused to give up. Shoulder to shoulder, hearts as big as themselves pumping with courage and determination, they laboured against the invisible wall of wind encasing them. Every so often a pocket of calm would open up and they jumped stride in an effort to regain lost ground but inevitably, these did not last long. It was as the horses fell once more to a slower, more strenuous pace after one of these pockets, that disaster almost struck. </p>\r\n<p>A sudden and particularly vicious eddy somehow caught hold of Royle, despite Alyse’s efforts to shield him with her body, and swung his back end out, slamming it against her hip. Royle dug his front claws deeper into the leather of the saddle, though they were already torn and bleeding from the punishment they had thus far endured. The wind lifted him again, sucking furiously. Alyse grabbed at his fur in an effort to check his flight but to no avail. Royle gave an almost human scream as the fur was torn from his flesh, leaving her with nothing but a bloody clump in her hand and a single claw alongside the deep gouges scored into her saddle. The next thing Royle knew was the air being squashed from his lungs as he was pinned precariously between two heaving bodies. A strong hand gripped him tightly by the scruff and he was hoisted up and stuffed unceremoniously down the front of Cymon’s shirt, where he lay trembling in shock and pain.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s one I owe you Sir Cat,” breathed Cymon, taking a quick moment to return Alyse’s relieved and grateful smile.</p>\r\n<p>As though enraged by the cats'' rescue, the pursuit took on a new intensity &mdash; a sense of urgency that caused Alyse to raise her eyes hopefully to the horizon and squint through the blinding dust. In a brief, illuminating flash of lightning, she spied the most glorious sight she thought she would ever behold...&nbsp;the autumn-clad boughs of towering trees swaying majestically over a dense, dark-green line of holly. She pointed triumphantly. Jarok shouted something. But his words were whipped away into the bedlam of noise around them and then his expression changed abruptly and he clapped his hand to his ear. It came away sticky with blood.</p>\r\n<p>''Ping!''&nbsp;''Zipp!''</p>\r\n<p>With alarming succession the group were strafed by whizzing missiles &mdash; tiny stones and pebbles that hit the ground in flurries of dust.</p>\r\n<p>''Pfft!''&nbsp;''Zing!''''</p>\r\n<p>These normally unnoticed and un-remarked constituents of the earth had suddenly become potentially lethal weapons, able to rip through flesh and bone by the force of the fury, which launched them. Cymon gestured for them to spread out, to create smaller targets, but even so Cymon and Jarok were soon studded with a numerable variety of cuts and wounds. Only Alyse remained unscathed. Very few crossed the path she was travelling and those that did stayed low. She soon realised this was not by chance. Duman could not risk harming her. He needed her alive. If anything should happen to her, the Power would be lost to him forever! The thought was both comforting and chilling. And it was useful. She motioned the others to stay close together while she ran her own horse in a random path around theirs. </p>\r\n<p>At first the bombardment carried on relentless until, when Jarok ducked to avoid being hit, a small stone ripped into her. As it tore through her collarbone, Alyse slumped forward onto the horses’ neck. She sensed the alarm of her two companions and turned her head to smile reassuringly. The Power had already started the healing process. But the enemy did not know this and the assault stopped almost immediately, but not the attack. It simply chose another target.</p>\r\n<p>Sheet lightning ripped through the echoing rolls of thunder as the pressure began to build and out of the churning cloud huge droplets of black rain began to fall. Lashing down in stinging, torrential waves it mingled with the blood from their copious wounds and ran in red rivulets down their bodies and onto the scorched earth, where it boiled and rose, in hissing clouds of scalding steam up the horses'' legs and across tender underbellies. The roans reacted in a frenzy of bucking and kicking, eyes rolling wildly as they screamed into the cacophony of deafening noise. Unable to defend themselves from the vaporous attack they felt trapped and confused and teetered on the edge of panic. Even Defiant, born as he had been into pain and death, was not immune and felt his own control slipping under the infectious desperation of the roans. Only his bond with Cymon kept him from letting go. </p>\r\n<p>Of the three riders, Jarok fared the worst under the horses’ wildness. Being smaller and lighter, he was tossed about like a rag doll. Only incredible luck and his terrified grip upon his horses'' mane kept him aboard... though he spent more time in the air than on its back! </p>\r\n<p>The earth quivered at this new onslaught and brought an incongruous smile to Alyse’s lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Courage, my children. This may yet turn to our advantage," she said in a low voice that drifted soothingly through the panic in the horses'' minds. Wrapping the reins tightly around one fist, Alyse probed the ever-constant madness dwelling just beyond her mental barriers. Within it, she sensed pockets of rebellion reflecting those of the earth below.</p>\r\n<p>''If you can hear me, please help us!'' </p>\r\n<p>The only response was scurrying murmurs filled with fear. She tried again, this time infusing her plea with memories of what once had been. Long forgotten images of lush, velvety grass damp with dew. Meadows adorned with multi-coloured flowers, trees of heavy blossom swaying by the banks of trickling streams. For a moment she thought she had succeeded. Then hope faded as, with wretched acceptance of their fate, the surviving spirits scuttled back into their madness. There had to be some way to get through to them. The horses could not take much more of this... and neither could they! Jarok was... </p>\r\n<p>"Jarok,” she screamed as her brother was suddenly thrown high into the air, losing his precious hold. Somehow, though afterwards he could not remember, Jarok managed to twist himself towards Alyse’s cry and as he fell the strap of his pouch caught on the pommel of her saddle. Alyse grabbed the seat of his pants and dragged him across the horse in front of her. Even though she had him, her fear still choked her throat so she could hardly breathe... but it also supplied the answer she had been seeking fear, fear and torment. For centuries it was all that these spirits had known. And though she would loathe treating them in such a hurtful fashion, she knew it was the only way. Eyes churning with amber fire, she stoked her anger and let it flow, noting with satisfaction the responding agitation. </p>\r\n<p>This time she did not ask, she commanded.</p>\r\n<p>"A''mathan! Mother’s Beloved! Hear me! I demand thine aid, for kin, for elfin blood that is once more in peril. I call upon thee. Remember thy beginnings, children of Y''siel and arise. Let no more blood be spilled here this day. Arise and restore the honour of the A''mathan! </p>\r\n<p>An uncertain hush fell over the whispering madness. She had their attention, now she must provide the motivation.</p>\r\n<p>''Behold! The Power of the Dragon!'' With a rush of exultation she released a shaft of energy, creating a bridge into the darkness beyond her barriers. ''Aid thine kinsman or suffer its Wrath. Be thou warned, for thou knowest the might of Ecos, that the tortures of Duman shalt be but a summers'' breeze beside it!'' </p>\r\n<p>It began as a humming. Countless voices were whispering together. Like a hive about to swarm it grew more and more excited then burst forth in a mighty rush. Alyse gasped as she felt the icy-cold touch of a myriad of spirits flood into her then pass out again into the demons'' domain to commence battle. Centuries of insane fear at last found some measure of release and the tortured spirits of the A''mathan turned with a vengeance upon their tormentors armed with hope, the remembrance of identity and the Power Alyse had released to them. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse knew that what she had given them would not be enough to break the curse, or allow the spirits to break free and return to the Mother but for now at least, they had something more than the miserable existence they had previously endured.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, Cymon and Jarok knew none of this. They saw and heard only a sudden, dramatic reduction in the chaos about them. The first things to go were the small dust devils. Becoming erratic and directionless they faded into nothing and with them, the restraining crosswinds. As the demons became increasingly preoccupied with their own survival, the wizard had no way to channel his energies. He could no longer sustain the rain and the steam clouds settled and evaporated. Though still in excruciating pain from raw and blistered burns, the horses limped into a canter towards the beckoning greenery of the deserts'' border. The rapidly deteriorating vortex, like its smaller companions, lost cohesion and fell apart, thus depositing the gigantic mass of debris it contained to form a giant cairn &mdash; a marker of the death of the wizard’s hope of victory this day. All he could manage now was the grumbling thunder that spoke his ongoing frustration and anger...&nbsp;and soon even that was silenced. On the astral plane the fighting continued however. Alyse was not sure if they would hear her but she sent the thought out anyway.</p>\r\n<p>''Thank You! Soon we shalt be safe. Know that thine honour is restored and all mine children shalt ever remember thy name. And knowest this also and take courage. Not all thy kin are lost! Rest, if thou canst, and one day I shalt return to take thee home A''mathan, Beloved of the Mother!'' </p>\r\n<p>By now they were almost at the border. Alyse turned to smile at Cymon and suddenly remembered the second aura of evil she had sensed earlier.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon,” she cried in alarm. "There is something out there, waiting for us."</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, I know. I caught a glimpse... over in that gap." His jubilant grin left Alyse frowning.</p>\r\n<p>"I see them too,” exclaimed Jarok in delight, though how he managed it with his face squashed between the roans'' shoulder and Alyse’s leg defies explanation. But he must have because he waved furiously in their direction until Alyse tapped his head sharply and warned him to be still. As she did so a group of men, all dressed in the same brown and green outfits, stepped out of the tree line shouting and waving them on. They appeared friendly enough but looks were deceiving and so Alyse quickly probed them. With relief she found no trace of the presence of evil. It puzzled her but it would be a while before she found out what had happened, for as they passed from the fiery desert into autumn coolness, the extent to which she had been expending her energy caught up with her. She was vaguely aware of strong hands lifting her down from the saddle, the touch of cool water upon her lips and a commanding voice bellowing close to her ear.</p>\r\n<p>"Sir Tynan! Here if you please!" </p>\r\n<p>Footsteps, murmurs and then the blissful peace and quiet of her astral abode.</p>\r\n', 1, 20, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 14:19:27', 1, '2012-03-16 14:19:37');

His wracked body lay writhing on the floor gasping for breath. The precious Orb rocked dangerously back and forth on the tripod. He forced himself to his knees, crawled across the floor and, clawing his way up the table leg, settled it safely back into its stand with shaking hands. Smoke from his frizzled hair mingled with that from his burned hands and face that were covered in charcoal-black scorch marks from the backlash of the uncontrolled, misspent energy that had been released. Beneath the black, his face turned a mottled purple with the intensity of the rage that broiled within him. <p></p>\r\n<p>So wrapped up in the fury of his emotions was he, that he never noticed that the Orb beneath his hands was empty...&nbsp;the green hued essence of Felnath having already departed. Had he done so, he would have known something was definitely amiss, for the Dragon should not have been able to absent the Orb without his having opened a channel, which he had most definitely not had time to do. But he was both physically and emotionally charged and emotional people often make mistakes and so the Dragon’s slip went by unnoticed. All Duman could think of at that moment was that he... Duman... had been thwarted by some chit of a girl!</p>\r\n<p>Shaking so violently that he almost dislodged the Orb again, Duman screamed in frustration. He clasped his hands together, squeezing them painfully in an effort to contain his persistent emotionalism. But with his hands out of action the tremors ran up his arms instead and into his shoulders and neck. First his lips, then his eyes began to twitch involuntarily and his head felt ready to burst. He was in fact, very close to a complete breakdown. Not since Ecos had first been lost to him had he experienced such a livid and overwhelming need to just let go, to allow free rein to all the destructive emotions and force within him. Flickering black and white spots blurred his vision as a wave of dizziness overtook him. He swayed on his feet, panting short, sharp bursts of air into his strangled lungs. Screaming foul curses upon the cause of his dementia he jerked out his hands.</p>\r\n<p>Anger-fuelled energy streamed from his fingertips and blasted the chair, resting in all innocence against the far wall, into microscopic pieces that ballooned up and outward in a shimmering cloud and drifted like drizzling fog about the room. Having dispensed with the chair without expending itself, the charge flowed outward along the floor and up and across the walls. One by one, the recalcitrant strands of energy gathered in a succession of miniature explosions and hovered in a huge, colourless fireball upon the ceiling directly above the Orb, which was now a mass of resonating blue sparks thrumming a greeting to the energy above. The two forces began pulling towards each other. If they should meet...&nbsp;A rush of alarmed horror brought sanity and Duman, now vehemently regretting his reckless action, hastily gathered his abused psyche together and threw out an even hastier, crude spell. A faint, green sphere encircled the Orb, absorbing the descending bolts so that they did nothing more than hiss and splutter harmlessly, upon its surface. Censuring himself for his stupidity, Duman quickly reversed the shielding spell and checked the Orb for damage, relieved to find it had sustained no harm. The Melding Orb was irreplaceable. Should it be lost...&nbsp;so too all his plans and dreams!</p>\r\n<p>He turned to survey the rest of the room, waving his hand to clear away the smoke and chair-fog that pervaded it. Instead of the polished black gleam, the room was now pitted with jagged holes joined together by white scorching that traced the pattern of the energy’s'' path around every surface. The legs of the table were still smoking, as was the door, but both were heavily protected by runic warding so the damage was superficial. He glanced down, his slippers had also gone and his robe had lost its sleeves and what was left hung in scorched tatters just below his knees. Yet despite all this chaos his tense body relaxed. What could have been disastrous had, thankfully, ended in minor mishap. But relaxed did not mean calm. Though now firmly under control, his anger still seethed within him. He paced round and round the table, a comical figure in his tattered gown and blackened bare feet. His manner however was far from amusing as he vented his rage by throwing curses upon everyone and everything.</p>\r\n<p>He cursed the demons of the Mornay craven, feckless ingrates! Cowardly ranks of nothing, with no more spine than a slug! As if their existence were of any importance!</p>\r\n<p>He cursed the Citog’s stupid, mindless beasts. That he had deliberately incorporated these traits (which kept them malleable and easy to manipulate) into their creation carried no weight in their defence for the reviling wizard.</p>\r\n<p>He cursed the pack-master, Hogeth. </p>\r\n<p>"Ah, yes! Hogeth," he cried aloud. "Let''s not forget Hogeth. Hogeth the Incompetent! Hogeth the Treacherous! Hogeth the Idiot!" Duman’s lips curled in a snarl. He had not been deceived by the pack-masters'' fawning and grovelling but the stupid creature had not the sense to realise this. Nor had he known that Duman had placed a relocation spell on him to be activated upon the pack-masters'' imminent demise. Oh! But now he knew. Now the quivering Hogeth, locked in stasis to deny him the escape of death and awaiting his promised retribution, was beginning to understand. Especially after Duman had let him know in vivid detail exactly what form that punishment would take, what reward he would receive for his failure and his treacherous leanings. Duman laughed in sheer delight as he recalled Hogeth’s terror when he realised that the wizard was well aware of every thought and desire he had so foolishly imagined was his closely guarded secret. Oh, yes! Now Hogeth knew the full power of the Master and he wailed in fear for the horrors to begin. Begin. But never end! Duman had made that very clear. Impressing the point deeply upon the miscreant, snivelling wretch. No one plotted against him without paying the price! And in this case, the price was an eternity of excruciating agony. Lifted by the anticipation of future amusement, Duman felt more himself and was able, at last, to turn his mind more rationally to the recent occurrence.</p>\r\n<p>He had been rocked by the sudden shift in the astro-dimensional cortex &mdash; the instant the girl had first used the power. The shock of it, so totally unexpected, had left him momentarily stunned. He was aware she had activated the power. But it was too soon, he thought...&nbsp;much too soon...&nbsp;for her to be able to wield it properly for she was unversed and ignorant in the matters of the Arts. He had even gone so far as to doubt she would ever manage to use it at all and this was why he had sent such a small force for what he had believed, would be a simple task.</p>\r\n<p>What manner of child was this? </p>\r\n<p>Admittedly her initial application was sloppy, she had allowed far too much residual energy to escape, but even so it had been controlled and confident. Reminiscent of Ecos himself! At first he thought perhaps Yushok had been training her but he brushed this notion aside. The A''mathan was himself inexperienced, so how could he tutor the girl? Besides which, he would have detected any attempts to practise immediately.</p>\r\n<p>He was surely missing something, somewhere, but reason as he would he could not for the life of him discover what it might be. He had thought he had delved into all aspects of the powers'' secrets before Ecos had become suspicious and turned against him. </p>\r\n<p>Had he underestimated the Dragon, just as he had underestimated the wretched girl today? </p>\r\n<p>Had the Dragon discovered his intent earlier than he knew and lied to him, when he had said it would take a force far greater than the capacity of mind any of the races possessed, to contain the power? </p>\r\n<p>Ecos had said the consequences of any attempt to do so would be mental processes so burnt out and utterly disabled, as to leave the body no more than a hollow shell. A fragile uncontrolled casing allowing the force within to erupt how and when it willed. This was why, or so Ecos had informed him, the Dragons had deemed it necessary to come into the land themselves and chose counterparts from amongst the Mother’s children. Not to receive power but to provide the intentions alien to the Dragon’s nature and to act as conduits, whilst the mighty willpower of the Dragons exerted control.</p>\r\n<p>Had Ecos lied? And if so, why?</p>\r\n<p>Because the Dragons wanted to keep it all for themselves, he concluded, as he had done on so many other occasions. They were afraid others would become as powerful as they and they would no longer be the superior ones.</p>\r\n<p>If Ecos had lied, then he had allied himself to the dark forces that kept him chained to this fortress unnecessarily... but then again... without them he could not have ensnared the Dragons which he needed to do in order to obtain the power, the word ''steal'' did not occur to him since he considered it rightfully his anyway.</p>\r\n<p>Had Ecos lied to him? </p>\r\n<p>Or was there something special about the girl herself? </p>\r\n<p>Or had Ecos, during his years of incarceration, discovered some way to tamper with the power, to temper it enough to minimise the untoward effects? </p>\r\n<p>But what could the Dragon have done... and how? </p>\r\n<p>He discounted this quickly. The Dragon’s ability to wield was one thing, but only the Mother had the authority and ability to tamper with the elements. Ecos must have been telling him the truth and yet this cursed woman-child certainly did not appear to be in a vegetative state! </p>\r\n<p>Duman banged his fist on the table in frustration, as every question ended in yet another, unanswerable question. Until he possessed the girl, he had no way of gleaning any of the information he needed to resolve anything. He returned his attention to his confrontation with Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"How on earth had she managed to incite those lily-livered spirits to rally to her and turn against him after all these centuries?" he asked the silent Orb, staring into its depths as if there he might find at least one answer. In actual fact, he had been more than a little surprised to learn that there were still some floating about that had not yet succumbed to the demons twisting. No matter! Whatever she had done would soon wear off and then he would reimburse them for their actions and things would return to the way they were, the way he had meant them to be. The curse stood on the land until he or his death lifted it...&nbsp;and he intended neither! </p>\r\n<p>He glanced about for the chair until he remembered its demise and slid himself down onto the cold stone of the floor instead, stretching his legs out before him. Deep in thought, he watched absentmindedly as his feet moved back and forth, noting vaguely that all his toenails were missing and wondering, without really caring, whether they would grow back again. His conscious thoughts were filled with Alyse. </p>\r\n<p>The girl was abler than she ought to be, that was a fact. He had to get hold of her as quickly as possible. The longer he waited, the harder would be her dispossession of the power. He played back what had occurred in the Mornay, using the space between his parted feet as a portal. </p>\r\n<p>All had been progressing nicely until he had spied the men along the border where</p>\r\n<p>Hogeth and the pack should have been. At that point he was unaware what had occurred concerning them, all he knew was that they were not where they were supposed to be. Enraged, he had sent the rain, hoping his quarry would lose their panicking horses and be stranded until he could relocate his erring minions and send them to pick up what was left. He had no doubts he could keep the puny men at bay until such time. This, he realised, had been his mistake. In what manner she had used it, he could not fathom but clearly this was the point at which events had turned in her favour. The images wavered and faded away.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course," he told his feet, "we shall have to revise our plans."</p>\r\n<p>His feet nodded obediently.</p>\r\n<p>"Open pursuit will undoubtedly no longer be enough. We must practise stealth and surprise."</p>\r\n<p>Again his feet nodded agreement.</p>\r\n<p>"Whom shall we send?"</p>\r\n<p>His feet stilled in thought, laying themselves flat on the stone as his knees bent. Duman leant his elbows on his knees, drumming his chin with his fingertips.</p>\r\n<p>"Perfect,” he announced, rising to his feet and striding purposefully out of the room. "But first things first!"</p>\r\n<p>Freshly attired in a blood-red robe with emerald-green and midnight blue tracing runic designs along hem, cuffs and the trim of its hood, Duman leaned over the low parapet that encircled the deep pit that descended down through the very heart of the fortress.</p>\r\n<p>"KRETOS!" </p>\r\n<p>His bellowing voice echoed down into the silent blackness, fading into the skittering sound of claws on stone.</p>\r\n<p>"Kretos,” he shouted again impatiently. "Why am I waiting?"</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Kretos" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Kretos" src="Kretos01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The skittering grew faster, louder. He heard a thump and an exclamation of pain before the footsteps resumed, coming to a halt behind him.</p>\r\n<p>"Y... y... yes M... master?" Stammered a squeaky, nasal voice.</p>\r\n<p>Duman turned, glowering in disgust at the creature grovelling before him. Filthy and emaciated, it crouched in a half-bow staring at the floor. Looking at the lank, greasy hair, running alive with an eco-system all of it’s own and the muck and grime encrusted upon it’s flesh, Duman found it hard to believe that beneath all the filth and infestation there was once a rather pretty, young peasant boy. </p>\r\n<p>He recalled the night the boy had been spotted at the far end of the causeway, trying to attract the attention of those that dwelt within. It was winter he remembered, cold and freezing, and the boy had stood shivering in no more than a shirt and trousers. Intrigued, though not impressed, by his courage and determination, Duman had instructed the guardians to let him pass. It had turned out that the boy had some fanciful idea that he may be of assistance to the wizard &mdash; some idiotic notion of training as his apprentice. Duman of course, had no need of an apprentice but, unfortunately for the hopeful youth, he was in need of a suitable subject for his latest experiment... Mind to Matter Transference. Even more unfortunate for the hapless boy was the fact that the wizard had not perfected the spell as well as he had thought. To cut a long story short, things got just a little bit mixed up and the resulting mish mash of the two subjects was the monstrosity he now surveyed. Duman shrugged. The boy survived, what more did he want, he thought heartlessly?</p>\r\n<p>"Where have you been?" he demanded.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m s... s... sorry, Master," stammered Kretos, daring to lift his head just a little in order to look at the wizard from behind the veil of hair. His elongated nose twitched nervously above protruding teeth and his closely spaced, black, beady eyes darted nervously from Duman’s face and back to the floor. "I s... s... slipped d... down the s... stairs and had to c... climb back up again." The click clacking of extended claws on his toes, tapping a staccato accompaniment to each stutter, jarred aggravatingly upon the wizard’s still tender nerves.</p>\r\n<p>"Stop that,” ordered Duman, sending him sprawling with the back of his hand. "I suppose it was that tail of yours again? Your last warning! Next time, I''ll cut it off." He slashed a threatening fingernail across the air in front of Kreto’s suddenly white face.</p>\r\n<p>"P... please, Master," whimpered Kretos, clutching the offending appendage to his chest. "I''ll k... k... keep it t... tied. See?" So saying, he pushed the end of it up into the belt of his tattered trousers as he gazed pleadingly at the wizard. Duman felt sick at the sight.</p>\r\n<p>"Walk behind me," he said spitefully. "I don''t want to have to look at you."</p>\r\n<p>"Y... y... yes, Master," answered Kretos, more than happy to be out from under Duman’s acute frown.</p>\r\n<p>"The Sectii?" asked Duman, striding ahead. "Where are they?"</p>\r\n<p>"In the bogs, Master." </p>\r\n<p>"What are they doing there?" said Duman sharply.</p>\r\n<p>"Procreating, Master."</p>\r\n<p>"The bogs are a dangerous place for such endeavours. Who ordered this?" demanded Duman, as if anyone else in Ak''thai would dare to presume to issue an order.</p>\r\n<p>"Y... y... you did, Master! D... don''t y... you r... r... re... member? To w... weed out the w... w... weak... w... weaklings?" Kretos reminded him.</p>\r\n<p>Duman came to a sudden halt and with a frightening slowness that had Kretos trembling more than he already was, turned and scrutinized Kreto’s face for any signs of falsehood or deception. In truth, he did vaguely recall giving orders something to that effect but after Hogeth’s recent treachery he was in no mood to take anything on face value. Kreto’s face however, revealed nothing but sincere, cringing cowardice and his mind, as Duman probed it, was an incoherent babble of fear and nonsense. To test his findings he kept his eyes firmly fixed upon Kretos ready to gauge his initial reactions, before he would have a chance to mask them, as he threw his next question.</p>\r\n<p>"That was over a century ago, was it not?"</p>\r\n<p>"One hundred and sixty five years, Master. B... but you never c... c... countermanded it and it''s n... not my place to m... make such d... d... decisions."</p>\r\n<p>The smell of fear oozed off the sweat that poured from the creature’s body but there was no sign of any deceit in his eyes. Duman nodded, satisfied.</p>\r\n<p>"How many are there?" he inquired, turning away and resuming walking. </p>\r\n<p>Kretos felt a wave of alarm sweep through him. Something in the tone told him that his master was going to require a goodly number.</p>\r\n<p>"W... we l... l... lost many to an f... f...fungus out... b... b... break, Master," he answered evasively.</p>\r\n<p>"How many are there?" repeated Duman.</p>\r\n<p>"A... and the b... bog... w... w... weevil took nearly all the s... s, seedlings t... two d... d... decades ago," Kretos dared to prevaricate again, nervously wringing his hands together until they squeaked.</p>\r\n<p>"How many?" Insisted Duman through clenched teeth as he slowed his walk and turned again.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos swallowed, licking dry lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Y... y... you have been c... c... calling for many f... for your w... w... work of l... late, mass... "</p>\r\n<p>"How... many...?" The calm, cold tone was more terrifying than any screaming rage. Kretos tried to cower down out of range but Duman already had him by the throat and lifted him up to face level, squeezing his skinny throat slowly as he pierced the beady eyes with his furious glare.</p>\r\n<p>"Henhy Hoo,” Kretos tried his best to answer. His face began to turn blue, his eyes bulged alarmingly and his tongue dropped out the side of his mouth dribbling saliva down Duman’s wrist. The world went black around the edges and he was just on the point of losing consciousness, when Duman threw him against the wall. Crouched on his hands and knees, coughing and retching violently, he gingerly rubbed his bruised neck until the wizard’s slippers appeared beneath his nose. He stiffened and raised his eyes nervously.</p>\r\n<p>"So? Have you remembered yet?" Duman asked him quietly, clicking his long nails in ominous impatience.</p>\r\n<p>"Twenty two, M... m... master," Kretos croaked painfully.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s better,” said Duman, one side of his mouth turning up in a false smile. "When I ask a question... I expect an answer, not excuses."</p>\r\n<p>Kretos cringed away as Duman’s hands reached out to him but to his surprise the wizard did not strike, only helped him to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Now off you go and round them up. See they''re sent to my anti-chamber. Rooted! I have work to do."</p>\r\n<p>Kretos did not like these gentle tones that spoke to him as an erring child, nor the indulgent pat on the head that the wizard gave him as he turned away. It was not natural... or normal. It confused him and caused him a deal of tense unease. With a deeply troubled frown ridging the encrusted dirt on his forehead into a miniature mountain range, he started to walk off up the corridor when Duman’s quiet tones called. He hurried back. Without warning Duman’s hand suddenly whipped forward, energy tipped nails extended. It all happened so quickly that Kretos felt no pain but just stared down in horror at the severed tail now lying at his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"We wouldn''t want you to fall and hurt yourself again, now would we?" laughed Duman with a sadistic sneer before striding off and leaving the maimed Kretos staring after him. It is doubtful that the wizard would have continued to laugh so loudly had he been aware of the hatred that blazed into his departing back from tiny black eyes. Nor, if he had seen the sly grin that wiped away all previous traces of apparent servility and cowardly stupidity. </p>\r\n<p>For a long while Kretos glared after the sound of the callous laughter before turning bleak eyes back to the wizard’s handiwork.</p>\r\n<p>Slowly, he bent down and picked up his tail, stroking it lovingly. It was not pain from the wound that caused his eyes to fill with tears but the pain of loss. The heart rending loss of the only part of himself that had remained true, uncontaminated by the human filth with which he had been melded. Tenderly, almost reverently, he settled the smooth, pink length back up through his belt, carefully adjusting it so that it hung against his thigh. He spat on the ground where the wizard had stood. </p>\r\n<p>He was so proud of himself, so full of his own prowess and cleverness, so stupid! </p>\r\n<p>In typical two-legged arrogance, he had never even stopped to consider that the intelligence that dwelt within this monstrosity of a shape was Rat...&nbsp;not human! </p>\r\n<p>Rat...&nbsp;with far more guile and cunning than he, or any two-leg, could ever hope to aspire to. With the underestimated intelligence that was one of the reasons why rats had spread so prolifically, colonizing every corner of the Earth, while other species had been driven to extinction. Intelligence... coupled with adaptability... and their contentment to remain in the lower order of life.</p>\r\n<p>In the First Age they had been created. </p>\r\n<p>Since the First Age they had been vilified, loathed and persecuted. Colony after colony eradicated. But the attributes they possessed enabled them to come back time after time. Called ''vermin'' by those races that walked on two legs; they were rather, Masters of Survival! They had seen them all come and go and this obnoxious, over-blown wizard would be no exception. Only this time it had a different edge. </p>\r\n<p>This time, for Kretos and his immediate family that dwelt within the fortress, it was personal. Too many of their brothers and sisters had been sacrificed to experiments and his sadistic pleasures. Though Kretos protected them as best he could, he was not the only minion in service to Duman and some were still taken. Even worse were those nightmare times that the wizard would pressure him and look at him with suspicion. Then he would have to ask some, usually the old and sick, to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the rest of the colony and to maintain their subterfuge until the time of freedom came. After such times, he would spend days grieving in a guilt-ridden stupor, unable to eat or sleep. Hiding alone in the dark, too ashamed and sick of himself to face the rest of his family, even though he knew they understood and accepted the necessities of his actions.</p>\r\n<p>A tiny squeak reminded him of the moment. His brother was right; he had no time to stand about wallowing. He would have to hurry if he was to complete his task before Duman started a renewed raving of his impatience. Kreto’s ugly face contorted with loathing. He spat again, and then scurried off to get the Sectii, the pathetic stump of his once glorious tail leaving a sticky trail of blood behind him.</p>\r\n<p>While Kretos seethed, Duman on the other hand, felt wonderfully relaxed. Releasing his pent up frustrations always had this effect on him...&nbsp;especially when it entailed inflicting pain. He stepped lightly to his Casting-room, list in hand, to gather up the required components for the spell he intended performing. He was not entirely happy about using the anti-chamber but since the Casting Room was not large enough to house all the Sectii at once, he had no other choice. He had been surprised to discover that the arrangement of the spell he intended casting came quite easily to him. Once he knew his aim, it all just seemed to fall into place. In fact, ''Visual Overlap'', so he had named it, had turned out to be such a simple matter that he could not understand why he had not thought of it before. </p>\r\n<p>The subjects he had already experimented on had turned out a three-to-one success rate and he considered that a safe enough margin for himself, especially since the spell was designed as a one-way process. So if things did wrong, all he had to do was eliminate the components! It was the plural that was his only real concern. All his other tests had been in the singular but he had neither the time nor the patience to mess about one on one. He could only trust that his calculations proved the rule. </p>\r\n<p>Having gathered all the items on his list, Duman returned to his antechamber. As the door swung open he was met by a thick, heavy odour of wet earth and moss, laced with the musty tang of decaying vegetation. Wafting delicately and elusively over this dank base drifted a tantalizingly light, sweet fragrance, that was there and gone before the senses had time to assimilate it properly. Alluring and strangely captivating, it teased the nostrils and it was with this exotic mix of seductive unpleasantness, the Sectii tempted their victims closer. For though they appeared harmless, sitting benignly in their pots, these were not mere plants but hybrid mutations of flora and fauna that combined insect characteristics with perfect camouflage. Though individual Sectus varied according to species, in shape, size and colour, certain features remained constant throughout. A smooth-barked main stem formed the central torso, topped in a crowning cluster of tiny buds. Coiling out from beneath and through these buds, twined long, curling tendrils and below these a thick abundance of flat broadleaves.</p>\r\n<p>As Duman approached the Sectii awoke, straining at the roots that bound them and revealing their true nature as the clusters of buds opened not to stigma and stamen but to expose the tiny, black pupils of a single, multi-faceted eye. The dense leaf growth unwound from the main stem and overlapping, barbed-edged leaves locked together to form a double pair of wings that were serviceable if not overly proficient. The ''harmless'' tendrils were revealed as antennae, proboscis and lethal, barbed stings capable of causing paralysis or death, depending on the size of the victim. Since Sectii preferred living tissue, they rarely reacted to any prey smaller than say... a medium size dog, unless of course threatened. While one of his better creations, the Sectii were nonetheless flawed, like all Duman’s attempts at creating life. Since they were first conceived he had been trying to rectify their annoying and often inconvenient habit of taking root should they remain inert too long, and even quicker should their feet be placed in soil as these had. Despite all his modifications and manipulations, each successive generation persisted in reverting back to this trait and because of this they had previously only been useful for quick, simple tasks such as the procuring of test subjects for his Art. Now, thanks to this spell and the information he had gleaned from the harpy’s'' dying vision, he could use them to better purpose in his quest for the girl. Especially since he knew almost exactly where to send them. Placing his load on the floor Duman walked slowly around the circle of pots, gently brushing the quivering antennae and making soft ''shushing'' sounds to soothe the agitated creatures. When he arrived back, at the first he held out his arms.</p>\r\n<p>"I have a task for you. Serve me well and I may not return you to the bogs but to a more productive soil, where your seedlings may grow in safety.”</p>\r\n<p>He made ready by first placing protective wards about the chamber then, as was his normal practise. Then he marked a pentagram upon the floor and tipped it with black candles.&nbsp;Drawing separate circles around each pot, he then connected them to each other and to the pentagram with a series of interlocking runes. Finally encompassed all in another circle. After double-checking to make sure there were no breaks in the powdered markings, Duman stepped into the pentagram, doused the wall lights with a sweep of his hand and lit the candles with a flick of his finger. The room began to hum as the magic of the runes flared to life.</p>\r\n<p>He dusted the inside of the bowl sitting on the floor in front of his crossed legs, with the mixed scent of the Sectii picked up on the back of his hand before dropping in his components, one by one. Once or twice, as the candles flared ominously, he paused his incantations until their flame settled again to a steady flicker. The contents of the bowl grew hot...&nbsp;turning red then white. Duman added two drops of water and a cloud of green vapour spewed upwards. Quick as he could (for the effects would not last long) he covered the bowl with his hands, ignoring the pain as his palms burned, blistered, peeled and dropped dead skin to mingle with the sorcery inside the bowl. Duman felt the pressure build beneath his hands. With a loud ''whoosh'', the bowl suddenly broke apart. </p>\r\n<p>Uttering a quick healing spell over his hands, he pushed aside the pieces of shattered pottery until he found the metal object lying amongst them. It was a long needle, no thicker than a strand of hair at the widest point; the tapered end barely visible to the naked eye. He picked it up and examined it closely. It was perfect! Still charged with the supernatural energies that created it, the needle hummed like a tuning fork. </p>\r\n<p>Using the Hurian language of the runes, Duman repeated the same word over and over as he passed the needle through the flame of the candle that burned at the uppermost tip of the pentagram &mdash; once for himself and once for each of the Sectii. Then, without pause or falter, he slowly and deliberately passed it through his right eye. So fine was the slither of metal that he hardly noticed its penetration and suffered little more than the discomfort of resistance that marked the back of his eyeball. Just as slowly he retrieved it, now covered with a thin coating of blood and black stickiness. Rising to his feet, he summoned a pot into the pentagram and repeated the procedure on one of the many pupils of the Sectus before him. </p>\r\n<p>Twenty-two times he repeated this process. When the last Sectus was done and returned to its place, Duman pressed the needle, point down, into the dark glow of the candles'' flame and let it go. His lips barely moved but the flame flared in a bright shower of multi-coloured energies that came together in deepest jet and imploded. Having sucked every last particle into the vacuum it created, the candle extinguished itself. Before the other four could do likewise, Duman swiftly uttered the final incantation by which he would activate, or de-activate, Visual Overlap. With only a heartbeat to spare, the room was plunged into darkness. </p>\r\n<p>He re-lit the sconces and his mind was immediately inundated with a confused medley of countless specks of information his brain could neither make sense of, nor cope with. Pain jarred at his temples and hot fire filled his eyes. He covered them with his hands but it made no difference... it wasn''t his own eyes he was looking through! As if the world was a mirror someone had carelessly shattered, his vision was awash with disjointed images. Some connected, some overlapping, half merging, half conflicting. He pressed his hands against his forehead unable to think coherently through the pain and jumbled confusion. Somehow, he managed to douse the lights.</p>\r\n<p>Relief! </p>\r\n<p>He sat quietly for a time in blissful blindness, having finally had the wit to de-activate the spell. Dismayed that it had all gone so terribly wrong, he ran through every step in the tiniest detail to discover his error. He could find none, yet there seemed no other choice but to destroy them all. He lifted his hand. Tiny sparks of energy crackled on the tips of his fingers, ready to be released into a single bolt. His hand poised to strike. The corners of his eyes began to wrinkle and his mouth twitched to one side. And then he was laughing triumphantly, having suddenly realised what he had done wrong. A specific rune joined each Sectus to him. He had simply forgotten to specify. Instead of singular, he had activated multiple overlap! No wonder it had been such a pain-filled mess. He had been looking through all the pupils of all twenty-two Sectii eyes simultaneously. Far from being a failure, his casting had been an overwhelming success. The energy drizzled harmlessly off the end of his fingernails. Lighting up the room again, he made certain that this time he specified a particular contact.</p>\r\n<p>Initially, he experienced the same disorientation, though nothing like so painful as before, but once the receptors in his brain accustomed themselves to this new way of seeing, he discovered it was truly amazing. It had been centuries since he had had such an incredible experience and never one such as this. Without having to move a muscle he was able to see the entire circumference of the room, from the top of the pot in which the Sectus rested, to the ceiling above and around every wall...&nbsp;and in amazing clarity! He saw cobwebs suspended from the corners of the room and slung out across the ceiling and the tiny spiders that waited with infinite patience at their centres. He saw the wall sconces opposite him, the rows of reading matter that filled the shelves lining the walls, the huge fireplace (cold and empty just now) and the deep, comfortable chair angled beside it where he spent many a cold evening dozing in front of a roaring fire with his feet stretched out upon the hearth. He saw the weird Huri paintings to his left, still hanging after all these years, and reminded himself for the untold time to have them removed. Beneath these, there was a large oak dresser, reminiscent of his life in Phelise and covered with knick-knacks. Among the childhood keepsakes and warrior trophies lay the shrivelled bodies of petrified animals and the skulls and bones of failed experiments. Ah, his favourite slippers! He had been looking for them everywhere and there they were, tucked down in the corner to his right. </p>\r\n<p>Behind him was the heavy door, the large, black, iron ring hanging slightly askew, vibrating to the humming green aura from the warding spell that flickered over it. Something flashed. Light reflected in the blinking eyes of a large rat crouched near the lintel. It watched him closely, unaware that the wizard now (albeit not physically) had eyes in the back of his head. Without turning, Duman flung his arm backwards. A fiery bolt shot from his fingers and with a squeal of surprised pain, the unwary rat lay dismembered.</p>\r\n<p>All this Duman saw as one image, in one instant. But perhaps the most stimulating and most enjoyable for him, was watching himself as he threw back his head, opened his mouth and laughed in delight at the amazed expression on his own face as he focused upon himself standing proudly in the centre of the room. Pure joy flushed his cheeks, accentuating the black circles of weariness that smudged his eyes and dulled the glow of success that burnt there.</p>\r\n<p>''I really should get more rest,'' he thought to himself, lifting his hands to explore the contours of his exertion-ravaged features as in a mirror. He could have stood for an age absorbing every detail, wallowing in triumphant conceit and vanity. He found it incredible, fascinating, mesmerizing, and to one who loved himself as much as Duman, tantalizingly erotic.</p>\r\n<p>"Who could ever have achieved such a unique experience but I?" he asked the Sectii, watching intently every movement of his lips. </p>\r\n<p>"Am I not indeed the greatest who ever lived? The ''MASTER'' of the Masters of the Arts!"</p>\r\n<p>He waved his arm in a flamboyant flourish and bowed low to himself, then strutted proudly around the chamber, making quick shifts in contact from one Sectus to another as he passed with barely a break in his vision &mdash; satisfied that he was completely comfortable and in control of the contact with each recipient, Duman released them from their pots.</p>\r\n<p>Chaos! </p>\r\n<p>Twenty-two Sectii flew in mad pandemonium, vying for the limited space within the confines of the room. Duman opened the door and they rushed through it, flying straight up the central tower seeking escape. As they left the fortress through various windows, Duman ordered each to remain circling until they were once more gathered in a group. It proved a slow process instructing each one individually, especially frustrating since he knew he had the capability for multiple contact. However he would not risk that again and eventually he managed to separate them into three groups and send them on their way. </p>\r\n<p>The first, he sent to stand watch along the lower slopes of the Anatol Mountains, in the vicinity of the gateway to Phelise. </p>\r\n<p>The second group were to station themselves around the outskirts of Talgheer, where the Westbrooke River crossed the borders of Upper and Lower Westbrooke. He calculated, according to their last location, that being in need of haste his quarry would pass through or, at the very least, close by the city. </p>\r\n<p>The third group would patrol the area between Talgheer and the Mornay. He would contact the Sectii at regular intervals and once he spotted her or her companions, he could re-deploy the groups accordingly. As the final group sped westward, Duman turned toward the sanctuary of his tower room. He had intended other business this day but recollecting the dark shadows of his eyes, he decided he needed sleep and that tomorrow would do just as well.</p>\r\n<p>Far below him, even below the fortress itself, other eyes watched the Sectii leaving and they kept on watching the sky until distance and the rising cliff opposite obscured their view. Kretos moved back into the network of tunnels that criss-crossed their way through mountain and fortress alike, wherein his family lived and ran &mdash; a veritable army of silent eyes and ears dwelling, almost invisibly, in every nook and cranny of the rock. Unseen or simply ignored, they provided Kretos with detailed information of everything that went on. There was little regarding the wizard’s plans and actions that Kretos did not know, for there was nowhere in the fortress that the rats could not gain access to, except the Casting Room.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos was well aware that he played a dangerous game but so far, his agile mind and acute acting ability had kept him alive. He did not fear death. If anything he would embrace the chance to be released from this loathsome body. It was the knowledge of what Duman would do to him, and probably his family also should he ever become aware of Kreto’s true nature, that he feared. He shuddered. Yet it was not even this fear that caused him to tremble and shake whenever he was in the wizard’s presence, it was the pent-up fury of intense, almost obsessive, hatred that sent palsied quivers along his spine. Each day his game grew more dangerous. One slip, one betraying word or look and he was done. </p>\r\n<p>Today...&nbsp;his heart raced. Today, he had come very close. He ran his hand over his tail, still hanging from his belt.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps when the Lady comes?" he sat down amidst the gathering of his family. "Perhaps then, our time will come also?"</p>\r\n<p>Just then a scout appeared and he bowed his head in mourning at the news that yet another member of the family would never return home again.</p>\r\n<p>High above the grieving family, ignorant and uncaring of their sorrow, Duman slept. As was their wont at such times, the brothers filled the Melding Orb with dancing colours as they joined together.</p>\r\n<p>''Thine action wert unwise!'' </p>\r\n<p>''Twas all I couldst do. I couldst barely contain mine exultation. Hath he questioned me, I shouldst surely hath told all.'' </p>\r\n<p>Then mayhap thy decision wast well-founded after all.''</p>\r\n<p>''Still, twas a great risk that couldst hath endangered us all.'' </p>\r\n<p>''I deemed it necessary. Twas mine decision to make!'' replied Felnath irritably.</p>\r\n<p>''Brothers! Hath we come together simply to argue?'' asked Tareb.</p>\r\n<p>''But what if his suspicions art aroused?'' insisted Baroth.</p>\r\n<p>''Then I shalt blame it on the force with which he didst relocate!'' laughed Felnath.</p>\r\n<p>The mists whirled in response. Rainbow gyrations joining in the exultation of which Felnath had earlier spoken. Duman’s defeat had been a great victory in their eyes, even though they were only secondary parties to it. Infectious, irresistible, the emotion grew and the colours swirled erratically, twisting and twining as the brothers released their feelings in the only way open to them. In and out they threaded, so rapidly that they overflowed upon themselves. Merging and combining in an unimaginable production of greens, blues, purples, reds, oranges, yellows, violets and a myriad of hues and tones incomprehensive to those who see only through a single spectrum. It was vivid and intense and continued to rise with uninhibited wildness. The Orb began to respond, filling the room with a pulsating hum.</p>\r\n<p>"Brothers! Restrain thyselves, else he wilt be upon us!'' As always it was the voice of Tareb that played the part of Caution. The kaleidoscope of colours faded to more sober and recognisable tones. ''Such reckless abandon wilt surely prove our downfall. It must not happen again,'' he warned.</p>\r\n<p>''Is that him?'' Felnaths'' voice was laced with uncharacteristic anxiety. Carried on the now fading resonance they had created in the Orb, was the unmistakable energy of another presence in the room.</p>\r\n<p>''No,'' Tareb answered with relief. ''But it doth prove how careless we hath become.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Yet I still sense that there is definitely something here. Watching,'' insisted Soleb.</p>\r\n<p>''Friend or foe?'' </p>\r\n<p>''I canst not tell. It doth simply watch,'' the red essence pulsed negatively. ''Though I canst sense no malice and wouldst therefore surmise it bears not his touch.'' </p>\r\n<p>"Nevertheless, we canst not be certain. Henceforth we shouldst remain doubly cautious and alert for this mysterious presence.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Agreed!'' The brothers assented.</p>\r\n<p>''Then let us maketh haste. Soleb, hast thou news?''</p>\r\n<p>''The Lady Alyse... '' Soleb paused as the Orb swirled questioningly. ''Yushok hath titled her so,'' he explained. ''The Lady Alyse herself hath said that her wielding is raw but Yushok doth say she is already skilled and adept, lacking only the refinements that cometh with practise.'' </p>\r\n<p>''How doeth they proceed?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Undecided. They are met with a company of Knights and the Lady rests. Decisions must needs await her awakening.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Of course!'' interjected a scornful voice. "She must rest. Let our needs wait... as always!'' </p>\r\n<p>''Felnath! Felnath! Hast thou so quickly forgotten the words of our brother, Ecos?''&nbsp;Tareb admonished mournfully: ''how sore it doth grieve me to hear thee speak so. We maketh allowances for the impetuosity of thine youth but I fear ''tis more than this. The bitterness that doth plague thee worms ever deeper into thane heart, consuming like cancer all the goodness there. If thou doth not resolve this brother, thou wilt become no more than him we despise.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Felnath,'' Soleb continued more gently. ''We art with thee and shareth in thine anger and hatred, but direct it at the guilty...&nbsp;not the innocent. ''Tis not the Lady Alyse that hath confined us. She hath challenged our enemy and thus taken up our cause, placing herself in grave peril. Dost thou truly begrudge her a short respite before all that is to come?'' </p>\r\n<p>Spring-green radiance dimmed to pale sage.</p>\r\n<p>''Again art I shamed... and rightly so,'' admitted Felnath. ''I shalt return now to mine abode and meditate upon the hollowness of mine heart.'' </p>\r\n<p>The others did not stay long after Felnath left. It was a sad parting but each knew the words had needed saying. Felnath had been growing increasingly restless and unpredictable. They were lucky that Duman’s calls upon the green Dragon were few and far between. Tareb lingered last of all. Slowly drifting within the now quiet emptiness he wiped the inner surface of the Orb, like a duster over furniture, ensuring that no trace of their earlier ebullience remained.</p>\r\n<p>It was as well he did, for Duman awoke sorely troubled by elusive dreams and immediately hurried to the Summoning Chamber. He placed his hands upon the Orb. It felt cold and lifeless, yet the nagging feeling that had drawn him to this room persisted. He cast his eyes about. Like the Orb, the room too was cold and empty. Though his senses were satisfied, his intuition remained tense and troubled. His eyes narrowed, pulling his features into a dark scowl centred about the concentrated suspicion twisting his pursed lips. Tapping his chin, he leaned over the Orb and stared fixedly into its depths. Again he ran his hands across its clear surface and again could sense nothing amiss. His face cleared into a self-deprecating grin and he shrugged. He was becoming paranoid.</p>\r\n<p>"Still...?" he mused into the silence as he paused in the doorway. "It might be wise to pay a little more attention in certain quarters."</p>\r\n<p>After a final glance around the room, Duman closed the door. Two pairs of black eyes followed his departure from a crack in the stones in the darkest corner of the room. When the lock clicked shut, they blinked in unison and then one set disappeared down the tunnel. When Kretos heard the news they brought, he knew he must find some way to warn the Dragons of the wizard’s suspicions. This would be easier said than done. He had no idea how to contact them directly, or indeed, if they understood any language other than that of the two-legs. If this was the case, it meant he would have to do it himself but there was no way he could enter any of the rooms using the family’s'' runways... he was much too big... which only left the doors and of course, all of them were ''runic'' warded. And even if he somehow managed to pass unscathed, with little knowledge of the Black runes he could not be sure they would not alert Duman to his having been there. He was setting himself a difficult... if not impossible task...&nbsp;at least from inside the fortress, he thought to himself as the gleam of an idea sparkled in his eye. If he could somehow find the Lady, perhaps she could warn them!</p>\r\n<p>He had the possible means to do this, if he could get it to cooperate. All he had to do was keep its presence a secret from Duman until he was ready to use it. Until then, he instructed his family to maintain their vigils in the Orb rooms and to keep their minds filled with thoughts of danger...&nbsp;an easy enough task! Whether or not the Dragons would be able to pick up on these thoughts he had no idea but it was all he could do until his plan was ready, or he thought of something better. Another messenger arrived as he was passing out these instructions, to tell him Duman was strutting the corridors with a foul temper and blazing fingertips. Kretos knew this meant he would probably be summoned anytime soon and hurried himself into a position where he would be able to answer the call quickly. It did not do to keep the wizard waiting in such moods... and he had had quite enough pain for one day... one way or another. </p>', 1, 20, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 14:19:27', 1, '2012-03-16 14:19:37');

(22, 'Order of the Dragon', 'CHAPTER TEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="C" src="C.gif">ymon’s euphoria over their amazing escape from the Mornay burst like a bubble as Alyse sagged into limp unconsciousness in the strangers’ arms. Heart pounding painfully with anxiety, he slipped from Defiant’s back onto legs so weak he almost collapsed himself. Pulling himself together he hurried to Alyse’s side, only to be brushed unceremoniously aside by the arriving Sir Tynan. He felt Jarok’s small hand push its way into his and glanced down. The boys’ face was nearly as white as his sisters’. Cymon pulled him close and together they waited while Sir Tynan clucked’ and tutted’ over Alyse’s inert form. <p></p>\r\n<p>“I think she’s just exhausted. No bones broken and no injuries that I can see. A good rest and a nourishing meal and she’ll be as good as new.”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon expelled the breath he had not realised he had been holding in great sigh of relief and raised his hand to offer his thanks to Sir Tynan. The man slapped it away and tore into him with a scathing rebuke.</p>\r\n<p>“No thanks to you, Sir! What on this Earth possessed you to take a child into the Mornay? Two children,” he nodded down at Jarok who was now kneeling beside Alyse. “Have you no sense? What were you thinking ma...?” His words were choked of as he looked directly at Cymon for the first time and his chin dropped nearly to the ground. </p>\r\n<p>As incredulity widened Sir Tynan’s eyes to popping point, Cymon realised with dismay, that in their haste to exit the Mornay and his anxiety over Alyse, he had forgotten to disguise himself. Though the face of the man holding Alyse was unreadable, the rest of the group shared Tynan’s stunned expression. Trying not to look as nervous as he felt and anxious to give a good impression, Cymon drew himself erect. He extended his hands, palms up, in greeting and introduced himself in the High Elfin speech of formal and ceremonial occasions.</p>\r\n<p>“I am Cymon,” he began, pleased that his voice sounded calm and steady despite his nerves. “Son and Firstborn of Naemon and Cylech. Elfin of True blood by the lineage of</p>\r\n<p>Y’siel. Warrior of the Elven... ” </p>\r\n<p>His recital was rudely interrupted by a loud snort from Defiant. He flicked the horse an icy glance that promised words later, and then continued deliberately. </p>\r\n<p>“... Elite. These are my charges, Alyse and her brother, Jarok,” he stretched his hand towards each in turn, “whom I am escorting to the safety of my homeland, Phelise.”</p>\r\n<p>“D’you know what he said,” the man holding Alyse whispered to Tynan out of the corner of a fixed smile as he nodded politely to Cymon’s speech.</p>\r\n<p>“Not a clue,” replied Tynan, who also proceeded to smile and nod at the elf. </p>\r\n<p>“My apologies. I was not thinking, ” said Cymon in Ansukese, feeling a complete idiot for expecting men who had obviously never encountered an Elf before to understand Elfin and hoping the red flush he could feel crawling up his neck was not blazing too brightly. He repeated his introduction. </p>\r\n<p>“Psst,” Jarok tugged at his sleeve. “You forgot to tell I’m a warrior too,” he whispered into Cymon’s bent ear.</p>\r\n<p>“So I did. Sorry,” Cymon whispered back hiding his grin. “Again I have been neglectful in my introductions...&nbsp;pray Sirs, accept my apologies. May I also present to you, Jarok. Brother of Alyse. Warrior of... the Dragon,” he finished with only the barest of hesitations.</p>\r\n<p>“Warrior of the Dragon,” Jarok repeated softly. “I like it!”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon smiled. He was rather pleased with it himself. The man holding Alyse laid her gently on the ground then stepped forward and, after a thoughtful pause to chose his words, also held out his palms. </p>\r\n<p>“Sir Davin, Knight of the First Order, Defender of Rohansuk, Soldier of the King and Captain of this Company, at your service. This is Sir Tynan. Second in Command and Honorary Physician.” Davin saluted both Cymon and Jarok and then, formalities over, held out his hand with a genuine, broad smile. “That was one lucky escape you had there,” he inclined his head toward the Mornay.</p>\r\n<p>“And here too, by the looks of it,” answered Cymon without thinking as he noted the numerous dead Citog that littered the bushes. “We’re indebted to you for your most timely intervention and assistance.” He turned away to pat Defiant, already regretting the looseness of his tongue. </p>\r\n<p>“Not at all,” Davin’s light tone revealed none of the curiosity behind his masked gaze. “We were after these on our own account. It wasn’t much of a fight anyway. They were too busy concentrating on you to notice us. Put most of them down before they even realised we were here. I should be thanking you really.”</p>\r\n<p>“I’m sure this is all very interesting,” Sir Tynan interrupted, “but I for one, would like to get these children back to camp.”</p>\r\n<p>That had all been some time earlier and now Cymon and Jarok sat around the campfire, dressed in clean clothes (supplied by various members of the company), wounds tended, well fed and gradually relaxing in the friendly atmosphere. Alyse was still asleep in the makeshift tent the knights had erected for her with Royle laying in lazy indolence across the entrance. Defiant and the two roans grazed amidst the rest of the herd, their legs and underbellies swathed in salve and bandages. </p>\r\n<p>With nothing left to do Cymon leaned forward, elbows on his knees and holding a mug of sweet tea, enjoying the atmosphere as the company entertained Jarok with a variety of tales and adventures. That they were quite outrageously elaborated (if not outright untruths) as each sought to outdo the other with deeds of heroism and wonder was quite lost on the enthralled boy. Cymon smiled, the nightmare of the Mornay fading as he watched the old, dreamy softness glaze Jarok’s eyes and heard the eagerness in his voice when he prompted a teller that hesitated too long with... ’What happened then?’... ’Really and truly?’... And the all-important... ’Did they get away?’ </p>\r\n<p>The knights were also enjoying themselves immensely, playing to their audience as well as any actors on the stage. But eventually, even they ran out of stories and gradually the snorting guffaws and the finger wagging of the good-natured barracking subsided. The camp fell into an easy silence as mugs were refilled and sentries changed. Jarok watched the movements of the men with great interest. Storing every detail, like the treasures in his pouch, to be pulled out and examined at leisure on a dull day. He noted the companionable backslapping and chatter as they passed each other &mdash; the tones of respect and admiration that crept not only into their voices but their whole demeanour whenever they spoke with Sir Davin. The supple tenseness as they shifted into alertness on their way to take their turn on guard duty. Their assured walk and quietly confident stance. The proud tilt of their heads, free from any trace of arrogance and the open sincerity of the smiling eyes that winked at him when they caught him looking. He noticed how they were all dressed in the same attire, soft brown leather trousers and jerkin over dark-green shirts that had hoods attached to the collars. Each carried a longbow, almost as tall as themselves, and a quiver of arrows slung across their backs. A puzzled frown creased his forehead and he began to fidget.</p>\r\n<p>“Is something wrong?” Asked Davin, wondering if the boy needed to answer a call of nature and was too embarrassed to ask where to go.</p>\r\n<p>“May I ask a question?”</p>\r\n<p>Davin hid his amusement. The boy had not stopped asking questions since he had regained his strength!</p>\r\n<p>“Of course,” he replied.</p>\r\n<p>“Are you sure you’re Knights? Only... ” Jarok hesitated, flicking a quick glance at Cymon who was, apparently, too engrossed in the bottom of his mug to notice, “in Cymon’s stories, all the Knights wear loads of armour and carry lances and huge swords and use words like thee’ and thou’ all the time,” Jarok explained his confusion, flicking another glance at Cymon to see if the elf was angry at him. Cymon’s face was the colour of a ripe cherry but he still seemed to be engrossed in his mug.</p>\r\n<p>“Ah,” sighed Davin unable to hide his smile this time, though he did manage to control the amusement in his voice for the sake of the squirming elf. “What you must understand Jarok, is that things have changed a lot since the Elves have been gone,” he began, in an effort to ease some of Cymon’s embarrassment. “Long ago these things were true... and still are in fact, for some of the Orders. But about two hundred years ago, one of the Regents realised that many of the tasks assigned to his men called for speed and stealth, such as tracking and information gathering. Clanking, cumbersome armour and the huge, slow warhorses necessary to carry such weights were impractical for such tasks. So he chose a group of his best men and set aside their armour for this purpose. Over the years this body of men grew and became the First Order, since invariably they received and carried out their orders before everyone else. We still have to wear full armour on state and ceremonial occasions but the rest of the time we dress like this. The bow is our choice of weapon since it works as we do... quietly and with speed.” As he finished he handed his own bow to Jarok, who came to sit at his feet and take it, running his hands over the smooth, well polished wood... worn over the years to perfectly fit the grip of its owner.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s beautiful,” he whispered.</p>\r\n<p>Davin shrugged. It was a good bow and had served him well enough over the years, but a bow was a bow... designed for service, not beauty. A gentle twang’ breezed the air as Jarok flicked the string then closed his eyes and held the tip of the bow close to his ear. When he looked up, his face was filled with the strangeness that had so often marked him different from the children in the village and had ultimately confined him to a solitary life. He gazed into Davin’s eyes as he spoke.</p>\r\n<p>“You didn’t cut this from the tree.”</p>\r\n<p>Davin was startled and his jaw dropped. Not only were the boys’ words a statement and not question, they were fact. Sensing something strange was going on by the uncharacteristic openness of their captains’ reaction, a hush fell over the rest of the men around the campfire as they waited for Davin’s reply.</p>\r\n<p>“No. I found the branch already fallen, perhaps blown off by the wind. It wasn’t exactly ideal but I knew that with a bit of extra work it would do. It seemed wasteful to cut more,” he confirmed.</p>\r\n<p>“How could he know that?” Tynan asked incredulously. “Davin was only a squire then. I remember how frustrated he got because it took so long in between all our other duties.”</p>\r\n<p>Davin looked across at Cymon, who could only shake his head, as mystified as any of his murmuring companions. For all his knowing of Jarok, he had never seen him behave with such an intense feyness before. Dreamy yes, on many occasions... but never so deeply...&nbsp;odd... he had to admit it, looking at the boy whose eyes were staring at the bow but appeared glazed, as though turned inwards, and whose head tilted from side to side as one might do trying to catch faint noises on the wind. Jarok blinked slowly and smiled up at Davin.</p>\r\n<p>“You’re a good man, Sir Davin of the First Order,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>On the surface they were nothing more than a casual sentence but something in Jarok’s voice sent shivers up Davin’s spine... and everyone else’s’ too. It was as though he were not speaking for himself but relaying a message on behalf of another. Davin clasped his trembling hands together as he gazed back at Jarok, more than a little unnerved and totally at a loss as to how to respond... if at all.</p>\r\n<p>“My brother has a great affinity with Nature,” Alyse’s voice made them all jump and there was a deal of nervous and embarrassed laughter as she stepped silently into the fires’ light. “She has been his only friend for eight years and they know each other well.” Alyse tousled Jarok’s hair fondly as she passed him to take his vacated place beside Cymon. Jarok beamed at her then turned his attention into his pouch, rummaging around and drawing forth a glossy, rich-brown flight feather of an eagle that he proceeded to attach to the top of the bow. With a final tug to ensure it was properly secure, he handed the bow back to Davin.</p>\r\n<p>“Now your arrows will always fly true,” he pronounced loudly holding the bow aloft for all to see, much to Davin’s chagrin, before offering it back to him. Davin took it with a mixture of astonishment and horror for its new embellishment. He hoped he mumbled some sort of thank you’ alongside the lop-sided smile that was all he could manage but he was not sure, all his attention was given to staring in disbelief at the fluttering feather. And yet... though many times over the following weeks (especially after ribbings from Tynan) he had a mind to remove it, he never actually brought himself around to doing so. Even to this day, now carried in the hands of his son, the eagles’ feather still flutters proudly... and never once has an arrow shot from that bow been known to miss its mark!</p>\r\n<p>But that is the future and we, reader, are concerned with the present where Davin dealt Tynan a sharp dig in the ribs to still his rising mirth and a narrow-eyed glare that warned against even the smallest comment. Tynan, along with most of the company present, took the hint and busied himself to inquire as to Alyse’s health and whether she was hungry while Davin placed the bow out of sight. Conversation passed casually while Alyse ate. When she had finished, she put down her plate and told Jarok it was time for bed. There followed all the usual protestations of children everywhere until Alyse placed her hand on Jarok’s head.</p>\r\n<p>“Go to bed Jarok. You are very tired,” she said softly.</p>\r\n<p>The sudden switch from animated denial to wide yawning and drooping eyelids was almost instantaneous and caused a spattering of uneasy murmuring around the fire. Davin motioned to one of his men to carry the now swaying Jarok to the tent. It was obviously time to talk.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon looked at Davin sitting opposite him. The man did not look so tall sitting down but the firm muscles of his lean body, honed to fitness and alertly poised, remained evident even in his relaxed posture. Black hair fell across his face as the knight leaned forward. Cymon watched as he swept it back absentmindedly... a regular habit that no longer registered, he guessed. Within the rugged features grey eyes, that only moments ago were soft with merriment, now gazed back at him with granite seriousness. They were the eyes of a soldier, Cymon recognised, bright and alert, while in their depths laid the unenviable knowledge of pain and death... of too many lives lost and taken. Eyes that said... ’too much, no more’... yet held the resignation of necessity. They were eyes, Cymon knew, that mirrored the heart of this man &mdash; sincere, honest and trustworthy. Even after such a short space of time, Cymon had a deep respect for the knight and was now torn between this newfound friendship and his duty to the Elders. He was spared the choice for a time as Davin took the initiative.</p>\r\n<p>“Perhaps I should begin,” Davin offered, “since undoubtedly my story shall be shorter in the telling,” and proceeded to explain how he and his men had been stationed in Amrose, just across the border in Middle Province, when troubling reports began coming in of strange, violent disturbances &mdash; death and mutilation of people, livestock and even the wildlife. Nothing it seemed was safe. The most disturbing part of these reports was that though the attacks were bestial, the perpetrators seemed to be moving with definite purpose and direction indicating that they were not the aimless killings of a mindless animal. </p>\r\n<p>Davin had been ordered to investigate. Following the gruesome trail had been relatively easy until about two days ago, when it had simply vanished. He had sent men in all directions trying to locate it again but they all returned without success. Since the last report had come from this area, he had decided to camp here for another day or two before returning to Amrose. Out hunting for supper, one of his men had tracked a deer into the undergrowth and by sheer luck of this, had stumbled upon the hiding Citog. Too intent upon the happenings in the Mornay to pay any attention to their rear, they were taken unawares as well as being totally outnumbered, so that the outcome was, to Davin’s mind, inevitable. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon took a moment to give thanks that Davin had not had to find out the hard way, the error in his thinking! The Citog leader, Cymon heard Davin saying, had apparently been taken down by one of his own, whilst attempting to flee. This had been witnessed by several of his men but as yet they had been unable to find any trace of his body.</p>\r\n<p>“... And then of course,” concluded Davin, “we spied you galloping across the Mornay... ”</p>\r\n<p>The sentence hung in the air, an invitation for Cymon to shed light on his half of the tale. Once more in a quandary, Cymon took refuge in his mug, to avoid the expectant faces filled with avid curiosity and to gather his thoughts. The silence dragged on, the atmosphere around the fire becoming increasingly strained. He could almost hear them all wondering why he refused to speak, what he had to hide. He felt Alyse’s hand cover his and lifted his eyes from his mug.</p>\r\n<p>“Tell them everything,” she advised with a nod.</p>\r\n<p>“But the Elders...?”</p>\r\n<p>“... Are safe in Phelise,” she finished sharply. “These men are out here, within his reach. By aiding us they have made themselves his enemies also, Cymon... they need to know! They deserve to know. Rohansuk must know. If it does not prepare, it will fall!” Davin listened to their exchange with an expression of mild interest, though inside his thoughts were racing. The girl was evidently far younger then the elf who had claimed her as one of his charges and yet her word appeared to carry more weight, if his acquiescent posture was anything to go by, than the leaders of his own race. </p>\r\n<p>Who was this he’ she referred to?&nbsp;Why did he feel a growing sense of alarm over her disturbing words about Rohansuk falling? </p>\r\n<p>And why did he hear a ring of truth in it rather than just laugh it away as nonsense?</p>\r\n<p>Whilst Davin watched Cymon and Alyse... Tynan watched Davin. Old and close friends as well as soldiers-in-arms, he knew Davin as well as he knew himself and was quick to pick up on those little idiosyncrasies that betrayed the thoughts behind the mask. Right now he watched the way Davin thumbed the tip of his bow, (and curiously, the feather tied there) a sure sign his friend was very disturbed. Clearly Davin did not dismiss the girls’ words as childish dramatics or the effects of sun and the shock of her recent ordeal, as he had been ready to do. Ever trustful of Davin’s judgement, he began to pay more serious attention.</p>\r\n<p>Unable to put it off any longer, Cymon tried to speak but found his throat suddenly dry and had the awful feeling he was going to totally embarrass himself by being sick. He took a mouthful of tea and swallowed hard. The Elders were going to have him on gate duty for a century after this, he thought miserably. He would be lucky if he ever fledged’ at all! Alyse tapped his arm impatiently. He drew a deep breath.</p>\r\n<p>“Have any of you ever heard of Duman?” </p>\r\n<p>“It sounds familiar,” Davin admitted uncertainly, trying to place the name.</p>\r\n<p>“It should do,” said Tynan. “The Chronicles of Gregos’ is full of him. The Chronicles’ are compulsory reading for all aspiring knights,” Tynan explained to Cymon and Alyse as he closed his eyes in concentration, pinching the bridge of his nose and muttering away to himself as he ran through the prose. “Ah, yes! I have it now. According to legend, Duman was one of the five heroes of the Hurian Wars...&nbsp;of Elven stock, I do believe.”</p>\r\n<p>“Elfin,” interrupted Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>“Sorry?”</p>\r\n<p>“The correct term is Elfin’,” Cymon explained. “Elven is generally used only to denote males in the plural. As your race are man and woman, we are elf and elfin but whilst you identify with the male of the species... Man, we identify with the female... since the Firstborn was Y’siel...&nbsp;and thus are Elfin.”</p>\r\n<p>“Oh. I see. The... err... book doesn’t actually make that quite...err... it doesn’t explain exactly,” Tynan stumbled awkwardly and then gave up. </p>\r\n<p>“I apologise if I have offended you.” “Not at all,” Cymon assured him quickly. “It’s a common mistake. I just thought I’d mention it.”</p>\r\n<p>“Accurate knowledge is a good thing to have,” Tynan thanked him genuinely, and then squinted into the fire. “Where was I? Oh yes! Duman was of Elfin stock. When the war ended he and the others simply disappeared. The book says Duman turned to the black magic and is supposed to have imprisoned his fellow heroes and the Dragons who had come to aid them. Many scholars hold that they actually returned home and in time, passed on. However, no evidence of their subsequent lives after the war, no bodies or graves, or any descendants, has ever been found to support the theory. Even so, few hold that the book is true. I don’t suppose we’ll ever really know what happened.”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s it?” Exclaimed Davin in disbelief. “As I recall that book was at least a foot thick!”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s the gist of it as I recall,” grinned Tynan. “At least, pertaining to this Duman’.”</p>\r\n<p>“Then why don’t they simply say that, instead of writing torturous tomes to bore the pants off of everybody?”</p>\r\n<p>“Because it’s not meant to entertain, my dear Captain,” replied Tynan with exaggerated patience. “Quite apart from the value of its historical contents, the actual reading of the book is in itself a lesson. Of self-discipline and control. Character building, you understand.” He laid a hand on Davin’s back then turned to Cymon and whispered loudly. “He never did manage to read it all, you know!”</p>\r\n<p>Davin scowled around the campfire to quell the burst of laughter that had erupted amongst his men but there was little threat behind the stare. The jovial exchange had created an easy atmosphere, as it was intended to Davin realised, catching Tynan’s faint nod of satisfaction as Cymon’s posture relaxed and words flowed more smoothly.</p>\r\n<p>“Begging your pardon,” queried a young knight by the name of Sir Roaban, after Cymon had finished telling them all he knew of his own mission and the subsequent events that had led to this meeting. “The Hurian Wars happened eons ago. You sound as though you’re talking of Duman himself but surely you mean one of his descendants?”</p>\r\n<p>“No. I mean Duman himself,” answered Cymon and went on to explain. “The wizard’s life force is sustained by the Black Arts he practises but even leaving that aside, as an elf Duman possesses a natural lifespan of some five thousand years.” </p>\r\n<p>“Pull the other one,” shouted a faceless voice above the babble of noise that suddenly erupted.</p>\r\n<p>“Surely you’re aware that Man has the shortest lifespan of all races?” Cymon called back.</p>\r\n<p>“Some of the other races may live a little longer, yes. But please! Five thousand years? That’s stretching it a bit don’t you think?” asked a voice from behind.</p>\r\n<p>“Perhaps you find it hard to believe but it’s true,” Cymon answered firmly as he turned to face the owner of the voice. “In Phelise, the Elders are all past four thousand years and some of the Grandmothers were old when even they were young. We live long lives but it has its drawbacks. Unlike your race, we beget few children.” </p>\r\n<p>“That doesn’t mean anything. Lots of couples only have one or two kids but they still don’t live forever.”</p>\r\n<p>“I never said forever’,” Cymon shouted, beginning to lose his temper as well as his grip on the proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>“Near enough. Five thousand years! Can you imagine what you’d look like after that long?” the speaker asked the man next to him. “A race of prunes!” </p>\r\n<p>Cymon gazed in despair at the mocking faces and shaking heads, scarcely recognisable as belonging to the same pleasant and likeable men whose company he had been enjoying a short time ago. Even Sir Davin was scowling darkly. Perhaps this disappointed him most of all, but then he could not know that Davin’s anger was directed at his men, not Cymon. He caught the eye of Roaban and found it comfortingly neutral. He smiled as he walked towards him. </p>\r\n<p>“You’ve been with me all day, Roaban. How old would you say I am?”</p>\r\n<p>“Older than me, perhaps?” Roaban shrugged vaguely, not entirely happy at being pushed into the forefront of the argument. “But definitely not as old as the Captain...&nbsp;no offence, Sir,” he added quickly.</p>\r\n<p>“As the Mother bears witness,” cried Cymon, standing close to the fire and turning around so everyone could get a good look at him. “I am four hundred and twenty three years of age!”</p>\r\n<p>“And I’m six hundred and two,” came a snorting shout. “I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to get some shut-eye.”</p>\r\n<p>“Sit,” warned Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>“Damn it, Sir,” moaned the disgruntled knight. “We’ll all be as nutty as he is if we have to listen to much more.”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon dropped helplessly back into his seat as the campfire erupted once again into a babble of confusion. He could not really blame them for their disbelief; he would find it difficult to accept too, in their position. He would however, have hoped to behave in a more polite and respectful manner. This perhaps was what made their ridicule so hard to bear, he had really come to like and admire these men. Still, it was not his place to judge the ways of other races.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike Cymon, Davin was not so understanding of his men’s’ behaviour. As a rule he liked to give his men the leeway to express their own opinions. Usually it worked quite well and they thought the more of him for it, while he got to know them better than most captains knew their men. It was partly his fault for allowing it go so far but even so, they were not squires anymore needing constant reminders and he was angry beyond measure at their lack of self-discipline and flagrant disregard of the Knights’ code. No matter the circumstances, there was no excuse for it. But the scathing words of shame, disgust and dishonour they had brought upon the Order, were never uttered. Like the rest, he froze as the ground beneath them began to shake and Alyse slowly rose from her seat. </p>\r\n<p>Except for the borrowed clothing she wore, there was no resemblance to the girl who had sat eating and drinking with them in the imposing figure framed in a golden aura. The fire flared in response as she stepped closer to it. Flames flickered over golden skin and crackled along her aura before disappearing into the night. Charged with Power, her hair swept up and out to join them, like the proud tail of a peacock. Her head was held high, her nostrils flared and her lips stretched in uncompromising tightness in rigid features contorted with anger. Worst of all though were the eyes, that blazed down the length of her nose and held the congregation in scornful silence, for they were not human eyes but fiery orbs of red-flecked amber. And as the company gazed back in terrified awe, she appeared to grow and grow until she towered over their shaking forms in a manner that screamed majesty, power and demanded absolute respect. Even Cymon drew back in shock as the strength of the emerging personality swept over him like a wave of heat. This was not the translucent beauty of the desert...&nbsp;this was Wrath Personified!</p>\r\n<p>From out of the darkness, those on guard duty were drawn to the fire. When all were assembled Alyse’s eyes narrowed and her fearsome gaze scoured the camp with contemptuous accusation that echoed without restraint, in a deep, resonant voice from which all shrank in shame and fear.</p>\r\n<p>“Foolish Mortals! Ye hath changed not, even after all this time. Ever didst thou argue while the enemy grew stronger? As twas then, so tis now. Knowest thou who speaketh to thee?”</p>\r\n<p>Burning eyes pulled each man to his feet with a piercing gaze and each fell, limp and sweating, back into his seat as they passed on to the next. Only Cymon escaped the ordeal.</p>\r\n<p>“No. I perceive that thou doth not. Listen then and learn....</p>\r\n<p>We are Ecos! Firstborn of the Draconian!</p>\r\n<p>Why mock ye my companion?</p>\r\n<p>Because thou art ignorant and thinketh that by doing this, thou canst conceal it. Instead thou doth reveal it even more so. Thou hast no understanding of that which is being revealed unto thee but thou art too arrogant, too vain, to hold thy silence and learn. Many of thy kind are there in this world. For such as thee, wouldst I leave this world to Duman and his ilk. But for such as these... ” Alyse’s face softened as her finger pointed to Cymon, Davin and Tynan, “for mine Brothers in captivity and for mine Sister... the Mother who gave me life... hath I suffered pain and mutilation. Gladly wouldst I walk into oblivion for their sake? Mark me now, for I shalt not be mocked. Fear not that I shalt harm thee, for tis in neither nature here contained to do so. But be advised, thy future doth hold grave peril and shouldst thou find thyself in danger, I shalt not lift mine arm to aid thee.</p>\r\n<p>That which the Elf hath spoken unto thee is Truth. </p>\r\n<p>As are The Chronicles of Gregos’, The Life of U’min’, Palach the Just’, and Dracht Torje.’ </p>\r\n<p>All these accounts wert written, not to immortalize heroes, but that each successive generation of every race shouldst hath access to this Truth. That nothing shouldst be forgotten.&nbsp;But Alas! Time passes and with it the true meaning of their scribing. Facts become legend and legend becomes myth. That which wert intended to teach and warn, is now no more than a dull tome...&nbsp;read only because one is compelled to do so. And because of this Duman hath achieved his aim of fading into obscurity; to practise; grow stronger and prepare so that at a time of his own chosing, he may pounce unawares on an unsuspecting world. Only the Elfin hath held the Truth as it wast meant and kept vigil. </p>\r\n<p>Now shalt I tell thee that which even the Elfin dost not know, though this Elf didst rightly suspect. That which I didst hide from evil wast given into this child. The road she hath since walked wert long and perilous and hath she resisted, twould surely hath meant her death. But she didst open herself unto me, that I mayest enter and we two be joined. </p>\r\n<p>Freely didst she embrace mine presence...&nbsp;and her reward?&nbsp;It was the forfeiture of her natural life and grief, by way of knowledge and understanding hitherto known only to mine self. Yet she hath embraced it all with courage, that this world mayest not be plunged into eternal darkness. And thou darest to insult her, by mocking he whom she hath chosen to stand beside her! </p>\r\n<p>Hang thine heads and hide thine hearts in shame, for without these two, wouldst I walk from thee as nothing but a bitter memory. </p>\r\n<p>And then give thanks for her. For only through her sacrifice am I born in this form even as I once wert born Dragon. And only through her entreaty am I with thee tonight that thou mayest know I am Awakened. </p>\r\n<p>But know this also; the enemy too is awoken. Vengeful, ambitious and full of hate, Duman hath once again raised his hand openly in the world. His arm is long, thou hast seen it already stretch across the Mornay, and his minions many. He hath seen thee aid us and thus will turn first to thee and thy kind, Race of Man.</p>\r\n<p>Mighty as I am by thine understanding, tis not yet the time of the Power to confront him and so thy task it shalt be, and that of those like thee, to defend the land against Duman’s minions. </p>\r\n<p>Believe this... the trail of death thou hath recently witnessed is as nothing to what the future doth hold shouldst thou persist in thine ignorance and refuse this warning. Lest thou forget or doubt mine words after we hath departed from thee, behold the fate of the A’mathan and knoweth that such is the future that awaits thee shouldst thou heed me not!” </p>\r\n<p>The fire flared even brighter and within the flames flickered images and scenes so unthinkable even some of the more battle-hardened knights were physically sick. All were left white faced and shaking. </p>\r\n<p>“Such is the fate that awaits all who wouldst use ignorance as a shield, for tis but fine ice across a raging torrent. It rests on thee therefore, to persuade them of the imminent peril ahead. All Races must unite under one banner, for only together doth any hath hope of victory. </p>\r\n<p>To thee, Sir Davin, I appoint this task, for thou art pure of heart and thy tongue hath never known the taste of falsehood. Twill not be easy, for most wilt refuse to believe and wilt mock thee as thy men didst mock the Elf. And of those that doest believe, many wilt be inclined to sit on their own fence, thinking they mayest learn from the pitfalls of others and thus strike a bargain with Duman to secure their own safety.</p>\r\n<p>THERE IS NO BARGAINING!</p>\r\n<p>The wizard seeketh not servitude and desireth not domination but nothing less than the complete and utter annihilation of all that doth draw the Mother’s breath. Turn thine eyes to the Mornay and thou shalt see the completion of his ambitions. </p>\r\n<p>I knowest thy thoughts, child of the Earth. Thou thinkest thou art not equipped to perform such a task... being but a common soldier. Fear not. Thou art experienced in the judging and leading of men. Thine innate honesty and strong sense of purpose hath the value of trust and respect and once thine heart is set, it knoweth not the name of defeat. </p>\r\n<p>One more thing: this thou mayest promise by mine word, that the Elfin shalt step forth from Phelise to fight at their side.</p>\r\n<p>Thou, Sir Tynan, shalt walk beside him, thy task... that which thou hast for many years performed naturally for love of thine brother. To lift his spirit in times of despair, to watch over his welfare when his single-mindedness doth threaten to overwhelm him and to provide laughter and hope in the face of reality.”</p>\r\n<p>“We can’t just disappear without orders,” exclaimed Davin, then glanced about his men to see who had had the temerity to interrupt the Dragon before he recognised the voice as his own and shrank down in his seat. </p>\r\n<p>“By thine own mouth hast thou sworn first allegiance to this land, over that to thine superiors. Defender of Rohansuk, Soldier of the King, art these not thine words? Honour now thine oath, Knight of the First Order,” commanded Ecos, then called to Sir Roaban who trembled even though the amber gaze appeared gentler than before.</p>\r\n<p>“To thee shalt fall the task of explaining the absence of thine brothers to thy King. Thou shalt inform him of all thou hast seen and heard here this night. Tell him to look to his southern borders, to that land once called Hur. There doth stand Runic Ak’thai, fortress of darkness and sanctuary of evil. Thou shalt convince thy King to call to arms his army. Rohansuk stands at the forefront of the world. If she remaineth idle, all shalt fall.</p>\r\n<p>Even so, under no circumstances shouldst an assault be made on Ak’thai itself. Dark magic protects it, against which thou art powerless. Those that are left shalt journey the land and raise up the people to prepare.</p>\r\n<p>The time hath come! Prepare ye for War, children of the Mother. </p>\r\n<p>The day of the Chosen approaches...&nbsp;but until then, thou art the Earths’ defence!”</p>\r\n<p>The night fell silent as the grave. Terrible as it was, each of them felt an overwhelming sense of loss as Alyse’s closed and the apparition before them shimmered and began to fade, leaving the night colder than before and the bright fire as useless as a candle in a field. Then it flickered uncertainly. It flickered and waned, waned and flickered, as though a physical manifestation of a silent argument. They waited with bated breath until at last, it blazed again in golden splendour. A unified gasp broke the silence as from somewhere within came streaks of amber fire that burnt through cloth and raised red welts upon the left forearm of each knight. There was no pain, only a mild, tingling sensation that passed as quickly as the livid, crimson stain subsided to reveal the likeness of tiny, golden Dragon. </p>\r\n<p>Above powerfully muscled haunches and blood-red talons, its wings were fully extended and pulled back to frame a proud head, twisted slightly as though looking up at the man that carried it. The long horn sloping up and backwards from between its smoking nostrils was matched by a smaller one, which rose from the crown of its head and marked the beginning of a spiny-boned ridge that ran atop a long, sinuous neck, along its backbone and down an equally long tail (that curved about each Man’s wrist) to the pronged tip which rested precisely on the individuals’ pulse.&nbsp;In every scale and ridge, from delicate membranous veins threading their way through the soft wings to the minute facets of its multi-coloured eyes, it was perfection in every intricate detail. And in every man the reaction was identical as they first stared in awed fascination and then hesitantly, almost reluctantly, brought up their right hands and brushed the image with delicate fingertips that snapped back quickly in shocked surprise, for not only was the Dragon so perfect it looked alive...&nbsp;it even felt alive, the warm, scaly contours of the Dragon’s body throbbing rhythmically with each beat of the wearers’ heart. As one, the knights stood. All fear gone from them now, they lifted their eyes boldly to the molten orbs in Alyse’s face as Ecos spoke again, this time softly in loving tones. </p>\r\n<p>“Our name is Ecos... Earth. And thou art sons of the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Henceforth, thou shalt be called Order of the Dragon’! </p>\r\n<p>Defend now, with all thy strength, that of which thou art a part. Show mine likeness to the people, that they mayest believe what thou hast seen and heard here this night. But not for this alone hath I bestowed the Dragonmark’ upon thee. With it thou canst, in time of peril, call upon the Earth and all that doth draw sustenance from her and they wilt aid thee. But choose wisely, my sons...&nbsp;for in this form am I limited and so, only once, mayest thou call upon the Dragonmark’.” </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s arms spread in an open embrace and she turned to smile at each man in turn until her gaze settled finally on Davin. </p>\r\n<p>“If we meet not again in this world...&nbsp;in the Mother’s arms shalt I greet thee?”</p>\r\n<p>With one accord and clenched fist, the knights drew their left arm across their chest in salute of the Being that had called them into his service. Picking up the fires’ light as they lowered them again, the Dragonmarks blazed a brilliant accompaniment to their new sense of purpose and zeal. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon watched it all with a hollow heart. He felt left behind somehow... forgotten...&nbsp;overlooked. A well of disappointment threatened to overflow and he fixed his eyes to the ground so that he would not see the empty place on his arm. Movement on the edge of his vision brought his head up sharply. As her aura subsided, Alyse’s knees had buckled. Jumping quickly from his seat, Cymon just managed to catch her in his arms before she hit the ground.</p>\r\n<p>“Are you alright?” he whispered anxiously. </p>\r\n<p>“That took more out of me than I realised it would,” she admitted.</p>\r\n<p>“You shouldn’t have given them the Dragonmark,” he snapped and was instantly ashamed, knowing it was not concern for her that had prompted the words. She kissed her palm and laid it against his cheek. Inner lids slid aside.</p>\r\n<p>“Thou needest no mark, Elfin, for thou art mine in ways these canst never be. I am one with thee almost as much as I am One with myself.</p>\r\n<p>Hath I not touched thine spirit? Knowest thou not how dear thou art to me?</p>\r\n<p>Let them hath their Dragonmark with good grace.... For thou hast mine heart.”</p>\r\n<p>Before Cymon could reply, both lids had closed and she was sleeping. He laid her down gently beside Jarok in the tent then settled himself outside next to Royle, hands behind his head and gazing vacantly into the dark skies. Something about what Alyse had said was bothering him and it was not just the contents, even though they did make his heart dance and his mind whirl. It was something else. Something about the way she had spoken. It was not the archaic speech that left him wondering if it had been Alyse or Ecos. It was something even more unusual. He was just drifting into the realms of sleep when he finally grasped it. She had spoken directly into his mind! The memory of what had happened in the Mornay was suddenly crystal clear, filling him with an overwhelming joy that left him gasping and as full of questions as Jarok. </p>\r\n<p>“Sleep.” </p>\r\n<p>The single suggestion sneaked softly into his thoughts with faint amusement and a little extra else that sent Cymon slipping into a deep, restful sleep, to awake refreshed and invigorated. </p>\r\n<p>He rose and stretched, lifting his face to the damp, drizzling sky. It felt good to be alive! Poking his head inside the tent, he saw Alyse’s empty blanket and looked around, wondering where she had gone.</p>\r\n<p>“Behind you.”</p>\r\n<p>The words rang like sweet music in his mind and he spun to see her emerge from the trees with the horses. Their bandages were gone and there was no sign of yesterdays’ traumatic events anywhere upon them. The roans were prancing sprightly yet they still failed to appear more than two gangly-legged colts beside Defiant’s proud regality. Aware of Cymon’s attention upon him, Defiant tossed his head and reared up, pawing the air. His neighing challenge cut across the camp as he dropped back down, drawing admiring eyes to watch him snorting and stomping the ground, muscles rippling beneath his gleaming, silver coat and giving evidence of his return to strength and eagerness for action.</p>\r\n<p>“Show off,” laughed Cymon, scratching Defiant’s neck when he finished his display and trotted over to rest his muzzle on the elf’s’ shoulder. Defiant swished his tail and chewed softly on the point of Cymon’s ear, as he had done as a young colt when he wanted to play. It seemed the horses also felt it was a special day for living. In fact the whole camp seemed to be infected, for despite the weighty seriousness of the tasks set before them there was a jovial atmosphere as the knights broke camp with light-hearted laughter.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok had been woken by Defiant’s cry and was now busily running from one knight to another, getting in all those last minute questions. His hands were a blur as they disappeared in and out of his pouch, exchanging gifts. Cymon was surprised that the boys’ usually quick eye, did not notice the Dragonmarks. If he did, he showed no sign of it and</p>\r\n<p>Cymon could not believe the boy would be able to restrain his curiosity about something so intriguing.</p>\r\n<p>“You are right,” smiled Alyse. “I have concealed them from him. He is not yet ready to know the full extent of the truth. In Phelise, it will be safe enough to tell him. As for the behaviour of the others... the road ahead is long and arduous, I thought to let them start it in good cheer...?”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was surprised by the uncertainty in her tone that sought his approval, after the commanding manner she had exhibited the night before. He had already forgotten she shared his thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>“Last night I did dangerous thing. I allowed Ecos domination of my psyche. Partly because I was angry at their treatment you and wanted to frighten them but mostly because I knew they would not listen to me any more than to you. Only he would be able to convince them. He did not want to do it. Like me he was angry and disappointed in their behaviour but he felt the risk was far too great. There would be others, he argued. He still thinks in the past you see, when the noble were in the majority, and it took some convincing to get him to believe that these were the best of men and that if we could not sway these, it was unlikely we would sway the rest. The point is, the commanding manner was not mine... it was Ecos.” She sighed. Cymon’s face was as blank as that of a child being taught to swim without water. “Now I have confused you. I shall try to explain. Whilst Ecos and I are of one body, one mind and even, to a certain extent...&nbsp;one spirit, there are yet two personalities within us. Ecos is ancient and wise, confident and commanding. Alyse? Well, you know me, capable but naive and innocent in the ways of the world and the commanding of men. Oh! I could follow Ecos’ lead blindly,” she admitted but then her voice grew stubborn. “But I do not want to become just an extension of Ecos! I want to learn for myself, to make my own judgements and decisions. Though I am content and happy to be Joined, I will not give up my identity for anybody, not even a Dragon!” Cymon would not be so unkind as to say she stamped her foot but rather, set it firmly along with her lips and the fists on her hips. Cymon smiled, it was so reminiscent of the first time he saw her. He was back on familiar territory with the Alyse he knew and he hugged her impulsively.</p>\r\n<p>“It scares me Cymon. I need your help to avoid losing myself,” she whispered with soft uncertainty into his chest.</p>\r\n<p>“As long as you wish,” he answered without hesitation, giving her another squeeze before letting her go as Jarok came bounding over full of excitement and calling for them to look upon his new acquisitions.</p>\r\n<p>“Duty before pleasure. Priorities,” Alyse stayed her brothers’ enthusiasm with a wagging finger, and then gave him a teasing grin. “Lesson Number One!” </p>\r\n<p>Jarok looked at her in surprise and then accusingly at Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>“Don’t look at me, I never said a word,” Cymon defended himself. “However,” he laid his hand gently over Jarok’s opening mouth and turned him around, “she’s right. There’ll be time later for your pouch... and your questions. First, we have important things to discuss with Sir Davin and his men,” he said, ushering the boy ahead of him as they walked across to where Davin stood in conversation with Tynan and Roaban.</p>\r\n<p>“... and tell him we’ve gone to Katatuk, to speak with the Dwarven Council,” Davin was instructing Roaban. “I don’t know how long it will take us. I’ve heard, from the few that have had dealings with them, that they’re the most obstinate and narrow-minded of all the races. If we can win them over, the others may be more inclined to listen. Let’s hope words will be enough with such a people. No offence Cymon, but after so long, many will find it hard to believe in Elv... Elfin allies,” he corrected himself quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon reached down inside his shirt and pulled out a chain from which hung a medallion about the size of his palm. Davin took it and turned it over in his hand. On one side was engraved the figure of a woman, in a dress of leaves with a profusion of tiny, half open buds and with hair cascading down to her knees. She stood, arms stretched, beneath an oak. In one hand she held the sun and in the other, the moon. On the counter side was some kind of script. Davin’s attempt to read it was rough and broken and Cymon winced as the knights’ tongue brutalized his beloved tongue.</p>\r\n<p>“Sel’nalei fenne, Y’siel. A’mathan. N’åsh ry’fra loth. Mathan amû,” Cymon read it for him.</p>\r\n<p>“What does it mean?” asked Tynan curiously, taking the medallion for a closer look.</p>\r\n<p>“Nothing important,” replied Cymon vaguely then turned back to Davin. “It is my Rùyi Sh’œrè. One may recognise it, especially amongst the Dwarves who also live long. It may prove useful in convincing them that your promise of Elfin aid is genuine.”</p>\r\n<p>“But if we don’t know its meaning how can we prove we didn’t simply find it, or worse, that we stole it?” asked Tynan, who was still intrigued by the mystery of the words. Cymon remained stubbornly silent. Davin shrugged, eyes warning Tynan to let it drop, they could not force the elf to talk. Alyse tutted and shook her head impatiently at Cymon as she took the medallion, pointing to each word as translated the inscriptions.</p>\r\n<p>“It means: ’Trueblood of the Firstborn, Y’siel &mdash; Favoured and Beloved of the Mother’. This first part and the image on the front, is his maternal lineage. Remember that: it is the more important of the two inscriptions. The second is the battle cry of his fathers’ warrior tribe... “Life without honour is less than death. To the Mother my spirit.” Of course, it is always difficult to translate Elfin precisely, but such will suffice for your purposes.”</p>\r\n<p>Davin would have loved to know more, Cymon’s set face told him there was a mystery here, but the elf was clearly uncomfortable and probably wishing he never offered the medallion in the first place, so Davin slipped the chain over his head.</p>\r\n<p>“Thank you for this,” he patted the medallion, now tucked safely out of sight down his shirt. I’ll take good care of it,” he promised sincerely, and then added with a twinkle in his eye. “Perhaps one day, when we have more time we’ll have a talk about family ancestry. I’ll tell you about all the black sheep in my family!” </p>\r\n<p>“I’d like that,” replied Cymon, an easy smile returning as the two of them shook hands.</p>\r\n<p>“Farewell, My Lady,” Davin crossed his arm over his chest in formal salute, then leaned forward and kissed her cheek. “We’ll do our utmost to carry out our appointed tasks, Cymon. Safe and speedy journey, Young Warrior of the Dragon!” He knelt down in front of Jarok and was immediately wrapped in a tight hug. He gave the boy a quick squeeze, rose and tapped him on one shoulder with the feathered tip of his bow. “You take good care of your sister now, that’s an order.” he said sternly. </p>\r\n<p>“Yes Sir, Captain. I will,” promised Jarok with great seriousness, surprising Davin by taking the knights’ right elbow in the warrior salute Cymon had shown him. Davin returned it, giving Jarok’s shoulder a friendly slap with his left hand at the same time. </p>\r\n<p>“Mount up,” cried Davin, doing just that.</p>\r\n<p>“Bye! Bye,” Jarok waved and shouted as he, Alyse and Cymon watched the Knight’s Company ride off to the south. All except Roaban, who turned his horse north, to follow the Mornay boundary until he could speed eastward to Symtar.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 20, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(23, 'Watcher at Willoway', 'CHAPTER ELVEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<p>"Will we ever see them again?" asked Jarok as he watched his new friends grow smaller and disappear. </p>\r\n<p>"We Elfin have a saying," answered Cymon, lifting Jarok onto his roan. "Tis better to have met a good man only once, than never at all!"</p>\r\n<p>"They do not," Alyse tutted.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s true,” Cymon insisted to Jarok, vaulting onto Defiant. "I just said it and I''m an elf!"</p>\r\n<p>"You are incorrigible," Alyse shook her head and tutted again, then nudged her mount and trotted along between the two males who were laughing uproariously, glancing from one to the other in mock despair which only made them laugh louder. </p>\r\n<p>However, by mid-day the early morning drizzle had become a steady downpour and it is hard to maintain a jovial mood with rain dripping down your neck and a chill wind blowing icy over sodden clothes. The flat, open countryside offered no sign of shelter and it was a miserable looking group that plodded uncomfortably over soggy fields, with the horses'' hooves slurping noisily, hock deep in thick, black mud. Visibility went down to a minimum in the lashing rain and they did not spy the rusty old gates until they almost walked into them. Cymon tested the padlocked chain but despite the thick rust, it held firm. Much of the wall though, had long since collapsed and they were able to find a place where the horses could hop over. They followed a cobbled path, keeping track of it more by the sound of the horses'' hooves than by sight, which led them to a derelict house.</p>\r\n<p>"Useless,” cried Cymon pointing to the caved-in roof, of which there was little left but a few broken beams and the odd tile and from which protruded the rotting remains of the fallen tree responsible. They moved on, following the path to their left, and came to a wheelhouse standing beside a large, reed-choked pond. Cymon dismounted. The door was locked but a single, well-aimed kick sent it crashing inwards. He disappeared inside.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Wheelhouse" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Wheelhouse" src="Wheelhouse01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>"There''s a few leaks," his voice preceded him out the doorway, "but the floor''s sound and there''s room for the horses too." </p>\r\n<p>A ''few leaks'' was something of an understatement but nevertheless there was room for all and the floor was stone. So while Alyse and Jarok divested themselves of their wet clothing and wrapped up in blankets (courtesy of the knights since theirs had been lost in the Mornay), Cymon gathered some dry kindling and got a fire going. Soon they were sitting around its crackling flames, sipping hot drinks as they watched the steam from their clothes and Royale’s fur (the cat had curled himself up as close to the fire as he could without actually setting himself alight!) mingle with the wood smoke and rise up into the rafters. Around them were the constant drip-drop of the leaky roof and the clatter of the boarding on the windows as it fought against the insistent wind. Gradually, their shivering subsided and once he was warmed through, Jarok began offering the knights’ gifts for Alyse and Cymon to inspect. After they had given them suitable appreciation, he re-packed them and then settled himself cross-legged on the warmed stone, rested his elbows in his lap and his chin in his hands, in what Cymon had now come to recognise as his ''Tell me a story'' pose. Sure enough, Jarok raised eager eyes towards him.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell me about Y''siel."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s smile faded instantly. He wished Jarok had asked him anything but this, though in his heart, he knew it had been inevitable since the morning’s events. Jarok sat waiting patiently for him to begin, quite unawares he was asking the elf to delve into something he had spent most of his life disciplining himself not to think about. But Jarok was not to know this and so, taking a deep breath, Cymon began the story of how the Mother had created a beautiful land and filled it with all manner of life, as varied as anyone could imagine. A land where She could rest, relax and play with the animals. But more and more often, other things intruded on Her, demanding Her attention and one day the trees cried out their loneliness. They begged Her for someone who would be with them always, to sit in their branches and talk with them and share the gift of life She had given them. Sorrowed by their sadness, the Mother gave birth to a daughter and named her Y''siel and She called her A''mathan, which means Beloved and Highly Favoured.</p>\r\n<p>She gave Y''siel the knowledge to talk to the trees and the power of transformation, so that she might be one with all the creatures abiding in the land. And the land was happy once more.</p>\r\n<p>And so, for a time, was Y''siel. But, just like the trees, Y''siel too grew lonely and desired those of her own kind to keep her company. So the Mother sent her brothers and sisters. But only to Y''siel and her descendants did she bequeath Power of substance... to the others, only the power of illusion. Still, they were happy to be alive and for many generations lived in peace and harmony until some of the younger Elfin grew jealous of those they began calling the ''privileged few'' and spread dissension and ill feeling against Y''siel and her children. Increasingly aware of the growing tension and afraid of what might happen should they stay, Y''siel asked the Mother to create a new place where she could take the A''mathan. The Mother did so and called it Earth and because it was such a vast land, She created other races to help the A''mathan tend it. </p>\r\n<p>"So they didn''t really leave Phelise of their own accord, like you said before?" interrupted Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"It could be argued either way," said Cymon sadly. "It depends whether one was willing to press a point and the rest of the Elfin nation was certainly not ready to do this. But no, I don''t suppose they did. They left because they knew it was the only way to ensure peace in Phelise. Perhaps if the Elders had known the consequences of this action, they may have exerted greater control upon the younger ones. We can''t know and now it is too late." Cymon fell silent, hoping he had said enough to satisfy the boy but Jarok was not content to let the story end there.</p>\r\n<p>"So, what happened then... to Y''siel?"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon closed his eyes for a moment and pushed his fingers through his hair. A heavy sigh escaped him. </p>\r\n<p>Pulling his blanket closer about him, he stared into the flames and continued.</p>\r\n<p>"One day, as she wandered amongst one of the new races, a young man saw her and fell in love. Y''siel was, as always, gentle and kind but he misinterpreted her actions, confessed his feelings and pledged his troth... "</p>\r\n<p>"Said he wanted to marry her," explained Alyse softly as Jarok’s mouth opened. </p>\r\n<p>"... Y''siel was distraught that she had unwittingly misled him and did her best to explain.</p>\r\n<p>The man flew into a rage. He said that if he couldn''t have her, no one would... and slew her. So sorrowful was the land without her, that the trees and plants withered and the animals hid themselves to sleep away their pain."</p>\r\n<p>"And Death was born,” breathed Jarok softly, his eyes brimming.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes... I suppose it was," agreed Cymon, touched by the boys'' empathy. "When Y’siel’s spirit returned to the Mother and told Her what had happened, the Mother was so angry She turned away from all She had created, intent that all should fade and die. But Y''siel, compassionate and forgiving, begged Her not to punish the innocence of many because of the mistake of one. Eventually, the Mother relented but not completely, resolving that in time all would suffer the fate of Her Firstborn. She allotted to each race a lifespan, determined by the length of time they had walked upon the land between their creation and Y’siel’s death. </p>\r\n<p>To the Elfin, the oldest, she allotted five thousand years. </p>\r\n<p>To the Dwarves, she allotted three thousand.</p>\r\n<p>To the Huri, she allotted eight hundred.</p>\r\n<p>To the Fellis and Soyex, who were created together, she allotted five hundred</p>\r\n<p>And to Man, the youngest, she allotted a mere one hundred years, or thereabouts."</p>\r\n<p>"What race was the man who killed Y''siel?" asked Jarok curiously.</p>\r\n<p>"No-one knows. It was Y’siel’s wish that this knowledge be wiped from all memory, lest hatred arise between them and the one responsible. And that''s the end of the tale."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok nodded but it was an absent nod, his thoughts already jumping ahead. Cymon could almost see the boys'' thoughts clicking together in that quick mind of his, as he absorbed all the details of the story and coming to a conclusion asked the inevitable question. He began preparing his answer so that he could deliver it calmly. </p>\r\n<p>"If you''re descended from Y''siel, then you must be A''mathan too,” Jarok exclaimed excitedly.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m afraid not," Cymon shook his head, much to Jarok’s disappointment. "When the A''mathan left, my distant Grandmother refused to go with them. She wouldn''t leave my Grandfather, who was of the warrior tribe and wished to remain in the Elite. It was a good life and he loved it and besides, he had no knowledge of husbandry. Grandmother knew if she talked him into going it would end up coming between them. That he would grow bitter as the years passed yearning for everything he had left behind. He might not show it but she knew it would be there. She was allowed to stay in Phelise, only on condition she never use her gift again or teach the way of it to her children. She agreed. The love of her husband was worth the sacrifice. With each successive generation, the loss of knowledge and neglected instruction meant the power eventually died in my line."</p>\r\n<p>"But...?" </p>\r\n<p>Cymon held up his hand. Though he smiled and kept his voice steady, his heart was racing and his thoughts in turmoil.</p>\r\n<p>"It is a dangerous path, to desire to be that which you are not intended to be," he recited the lesson that had been taught to him all through his childhood.</p>\r\n<p>"It is also wasteful and disrespectful to the Mother, not to exercise to their full potential, the gifts which she bestows," countered Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Please," Cymon gazed from one to the other. "As my friends, I''m asking you not to pursue this any further. I''ve struggled long and hard since I was instructed in the lineage of my birth. I will not become as Duman, twisted with bitter desires and ambitions. Surely you of all people, can understand the folly of it?" he demanded of Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman was not of Y’siel’s line. The gift was never his to have," she countered again.</p>\r\n<p>"I am content," insisted Cymon, turning away to throw more wood onto the fire and hide the anguish in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you?" Alyse pressed him.</p>\r\n<p>"ENOUGH,” he shouted, white faced and shaking. "I don''t want to talk about it any more." </p>\r\n<p>"If you are so content, why does it bother you so to talk about it?" </p>\r\n<p>"Why can''t you just leave it alone? Why gnaw and gnaw like a dog with a bone?" his tone was almost pleading beneath his rising anger. </p>\r\n<p>"Is that what you do... in the quiet of the night when you feel its touch?" She smiled knowingly.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok recoiled from the fierceness of Cymon’s glare as the elf jumped to his feet, not even bothering to hide his nakedness as he let the blanket fall and began pulling on his damp clothes.</p>\r\n<p>"The A''mathan are gone. Are you listening?" he grabbed Alyse by the chin and dragged her averted gaze to face him. "Gone! Dead! Extinct!" He spat each word out cruelly as he snatched up his boots. Then he leant forward, his lips a hairsbreadth from hers. "I am not A''mathan and never will be," he ground out between clenched teeth. "Deal with it. I have."</p>\r\n<p>This time Alyse said nothing, only gazed sadly at his back as he strode angrily to the door in his bare feet. Defiant walked after him, giving his head a shake as he passed Alyse, as if disappointed by her treatment of his friend. Royle rose and padded behind Defiant. He laid himself in the open doorway then gave Alyse a long, censorious stare before turning his face to the storm outside. Jarok, bemused and hurt by Cymon’s angry reaction, climbed onto Alyse’s lap.</p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t mean to upset him," he said unhappily.</p>\r\n<p>"It was not you, Jarok. Nor even my persistence. It is something far deeper," she reassured him, kissing the top of his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Could he have the Power though, Alyse? Could he be A''mathan?" he could not resist asking.</p>\r\n<p>"The Power descends through the maternal line... so yes, he has it through his mother, Naemon, whose great, great, great Grandmother it was that remained in Phelise. But he was right in saying that her line has lost the knowledge of using it."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok wriggled more comfortably into her lap and stared into the fire, chewing his bottom lip along with his thoughts. Alyse waited, watching his animated face with hidden amusement for the sudden sparkle to light his eyes as the idea took form in his mind.</p>\r\n<p>"I bet you could teach him. Now that you can... well... do things,” he stumbled awkwardly over the words and hugged her at the same time so she would know he did not mean anything by it. Alyse kissed the top of his head to let him know in return that all was well.</p>\r\n<p>"Well? Could you?"</p>\r\n<p>"It is possible that I could...&nbsp;But," she stressed, "it has to be his own decision and now is not... " She stopped abruptly and nudged him to his feet as Royle grumbled from the door and rose, hackles up. "Get dressed," she ordered.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok picked up his still damp clothes with distaste. She motioned him to hurry and with a sigh of resignation he began pulling on his trousers.</p>\r\n<p>"Do elfin children have to obey their elders too?" he muttered in a casual aside. Alyse turned away to hide her grin; her brother did not give up easily!</p>\r\n<p>"Probably," she replied absently, as if she had no idea of his intent.</p>\r\n<p>"Then maybe you should speak to Cymon’s mother when we get to Phelise. She can help him make his decision,” he announced with pride at his believed manoeuvring of her.</p>\r\n<p>"You are getting too clever by half, young man," she played along, laughing softly as she helped him button his shirt and pull on his boots. </p>\r\n<p>"Did you notice the way his ears wiggle when he''s angry?" he joked, happy now that, in his mind, everything had been sorted out.</p>\r\n<p>"No, I cannot say that I did," mumbled Alyse, bending to gather up the blankets and hide the sudden flush of her cheeks. Now it was Jarok’s turn to laugh at her.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh,” hissed Cymon, making them both jump as he returned on silent feet. "Outside. Quickly. We''ve got company and I don''t think they''re friendly!" He picked up a few brands from the fire and threw them about the room. "That should confuse them for a bit...&nbsp;I hope!"</p>\r\n<p>The clip-clop of the horses'' hooves sounded like thunder in their ears as they slipped out into the night, crept along the side of the wheelhouse and across the muddy shadows of the weed choked garden at the back. Surrounded by shoulder high thistles and nettles, they had scarcely taken a dozen steps before they were throbbing with tingling stings. Cymon did his best to shield Jarok and would have spared him if he could by allowing him to ride, but with the storm passed and a clear sky overhead, these were their only concealment from the bright, silver light of the nearly full moon. At last they reached the wall, only to find this area still intact. Suddenly there was loud ''whoosh'' as the fire in the wheelhouse blew rampant, orange flame high into the night. Over the noise of the crackling flames, came harsh, guttural voices. The language was unknown but the sound of panic and pain are universal. One word however, was clearly audible and recognisable. A name. Duman!</p>\r\n<p>"That fire won''t last long after all the rain we''ve just had," said Cymon. "It''s now or never!"</p>\r\n<p>He hoisted Jarok and Alyse up onto their horses and jumped onto Defiant. Luck was with them and they found a gap within a few strides. Once through into the open country, they broke into a gallop and soon the fire was no more than a faint glow behind them but whether that was due to distance or the fires'' failing it was difficult to tell. They kept up their speed. Cymon leading them north and only gradually veering back westward when he was satisfied it was safe to do so. When their path crossed a road, Cymon reined in. All was quiet. The nocturnal animals appeared undisturbed and in light of this, Cymon felt it safe to assume that they were not being followed, and the road was empty for as far as he could see. </p>\r\n<p>"Our course lies straight but we''re sorely in need of provisions and Jarok needs to rest somewhere warm and safe. We''ve more chance of coming upon a village if we take the road," he advised Alyse who, glancing at Jarok’s hunched and weary figure, nodded her agreement.</p>\r\n<p>In truth it was more of a track than a road, often barely wide enough for them to ride abreast. The surface was wet and sticky, sucking at the horses'' legs, and dropped off into a water-filled ditch that sparkled in the moonlight. A fox slipped silently out of the hedgerow. Defiant reared, just avoiding stepping on it as it stopped to look up at them, inquisitive eyes reflecting luminescent in the darkness. Then it sped across the track, half slid down into the ditch, neatly jumped the stagnant water and was off up the other side and away in the blink of an eye. The road carried on interminably into the night, the distance lengthened by their weariness and miserable state, yet still they saw nothing but the black outline of tree and bush. Cymon was beginning to think his decision had been a wrong one, when the ground took on a steady incline to join up with the high bank of a river. </p>\r\n<p>There, were several cargo barges moored along its bank though no signs of any people.</p>\r\n<p>"It must be the Westbrooke," said Cymon casting his eyes up and down the swiftly running water. "To my knowledge, there are no other large waterways hereabouts. There''s surely a village nearby," he said, pointing to the empty barges. "The owners of these have to be somewhere." </p>\r\n<p>"This way," Alyse turned her horse to the right.</p>\r\n<p>They followed the meandering river and soon spied a cluster of dwellings spread out on either bank. On their side all were dark but Cymon spotted a light shining from the window of a small cottage just over the bridge. He told the others to stay where they were and went on alone to check it out. At the first sounds of Defiant’s hooves clattering on the wood, the door of the cottage opened and the light began to move. They met about halfway and even before the man used the small cart he was pulling to block access, Cymon realised this was trouble. He dismounted slowly, easing the scythe at his back into a more manageable position. To Cymon’s surprise the man proved to be quite a bit taller than himself (his obesity having given the impression of a much shorter person) and made Cymon wish he had remained mounted, for he felt at a disadvantage having to look up at him. The man moved from behind the cart with a pronounced limp that caused him to waddle like a duck rather than walk but any amusement this might have generated was quashed by the mean, opportunistic gleam in his close, piggy eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"And where d''you think you''re goin''?" Coarse and common, his tone was contemptuous and distinctly unfriendly, as was the podgy, white finger he poked in Cymon’s chest.</p>\r\n<p>"My family and I saw your light and thought... " Cymon began only to be rudely interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>"Family, eh? Well that''ll be a copper apiece. Five more, if you''ve got a wagon!" Greedy eyes peered over Cymon’s shoulder to where Alyse and Jarok waited. Cymon had the disgusted feeling that had the man not had the lantern to hold, he would be eagerly rubbing his fat, little hands together by now. Cymon was not one to take an instant dislike against another but for this man he was ready to make an exception. Still, it was late and they needed shelter so he pasted a smile on his mouth and politeness in his tone.</p>\r\n<p>"But surely this a free bridge? I don''t recollect there being any toll last time I passed this way."</p>\r\n<p>"That was then and this is now. No money... no crossin''!" the man shifted his stance in an attempt to appear more menacing. The ruse failed dismally. His damaged limb and gross weight made the movement awkward and the sight of his huge, sagging belly wobbling over the belt of his trousers was more nauseating than threatening. Cymon stared at him with masked contempt. </p>\r\n<p>"It''ll be double, you keep me standin'' out here in the cold much longer," he sneered, growing bolder as he misinterpreted Cymon’s silence.</p>\r\n<p>"We could simply run you down," offered Cymon, his pleasant tone belying the seriousness of his words.</p>\r\n<p>"What? And risk injury to one of them?" the man laughed, leaning back into the cart and producing a hefty-sized club which he pointed threateningly down the bridge. "Terrible shame, that young''un coming a cropper all for the sake of a tight purse." </p>\r\n<p>"You tread dangerous ground, friend," warned Cymon, all pretence gone from his angry glare as he slipped his hand behind his back.</p>\r\n<p>"And you''re treading on mine. So pay up or get lost!" jeered the man swinging his club, though with less confidence as Defiant snorted and scrapped his hoof on the wooden walkway and Cymon took a step forward.</p>\r\n<p>"What on earth is all this commotion about?" another voice suddenly broke onto the scene. "It''s enough to waken the dead! Oh! I might''ve guessed you''d have something to do with this, Sylo. What''s the problem young man," she asked Cymon in a friendlier tone.</p>\r\n<p>"He refuses to allow us access across the bridge unless we pay him," replied Cymon, his eyes never leaving the man she had called Sylo until she stepped in front of him and her back cut off his view. </p>\r\n<p>"Since when has it been your bridge?" she demanded of Sylo in a tone that made it obvious that she held little regard for him. </p>\r\n<p>"Stay out this, you interfering'' old hag. It''s none of your affair!" Sylo warned her.</p>\r\n<p>"You made it mine when you woke me from my bed with all your blustering. Glare all you like, you don''t frighten me none. Go on," she waved her hand in his face, "get back indoors before you rouse the whole village."</p>\r\n<p>If looks could kill she would have been dead but all she did was laugh. Sylo lifted his club.&nbsp;Suddenly she was sandwiched between two snarling dogs.</p>\r\n<p>"Well?" she taunted. </p>\r\n<p>Sylo was shaking with rage. He glared at her, and then at the two dogs and then at Cymon, now armed with the scythe in full view. For a moment Cymon thought the man was going to be stupid enough to continue and then the light went out of his eyes and he threw the club into the cart, grabbed the handles and waddled off back to his cottage as fast as he was able with the dogs snapping at his heels.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll ''ave you for this. See if I don''t,” he threatened from the safety of his doorway.</p>\r\n<p>"So you keep telling me,” she threw back with an insulting laugh. </p>\r\n<p>The door slammed shut. From inside, a high-pitched voice rose in whining complaint to the strains of loud banging.</p>\r\n<p>"And you can shut up as well,” Sylo’s shout rattled the windowpanes. The sound of a hand on flesh was followed by an almighty crash and then the light went out.</p>\r\n<p>Wrapped warmly against the early morning chill in a woollen shawl, it was difficult to see the woman’s'' face clearly but Cymon caught a glimpse of twinkling, pale-blue eyes as she warmly offered them the hospitality of her home. Cymon thanked her, beckoned to Alyse and Jarok and together they followed her and the two bouncing dogs back to her cottage.</p>\r\n<p>The kitchen was warm and cosy: a cheery fire in the grate creating a welcoming atmosphere as it heated the pot hanging over it, whose contents filled the room with a mouth-watering aroma. Closing the door, she removed her shawl and hung it on the peg behind it. Then she turned, the motherly gaze in her plump features running over each of them. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, a more sorry looking group I don''t think I''ve ever seen,” she announced, tutting loudly as she shook her grey head at them. </p>\r\n<p>And indeed they were! Tired and worn, hair tangled and splattered from head to foot in mud, trousers and shirts torn in several places and all of them stained and smudged with wood smoke. Jarok’s face and neck were covered in tiny, red lumps from the numerous stings he had suffered.</p>\r\n<p>"Here''s a young man fit to drop." She descending upon Jarok; who was standing limply beside Alyse with barely the strength to yawn; clucking like a mother hen. She sat him at the table and set a steaming bowl of porridge in front of him, putting a spoon in his hand and urging him to eat as she ladled two more bowls for Alyse and Cymon. By the time they had finished eating, a bath had appeared beside the fire. Jarok was too tired to protest as she divested him of his clothes and plunged him into the warm, soapy water. He was already half asleep before she lifted him out and dried him and by the time she had laid him in the bed and pulled the blankets over him, he was snoring softly. The two dogs jumped onto the bed and cuddled up either side of him.</p>\r\n<p>"Now then, Missy," she strode purposefully towards Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"I think I''d better go and see to the horses."</p>\r\n<p>"Good idea," agreed the woman. "There are some old sacks in the shed out back." </p>\r\n<p>Cymon took his time and when he finally returned, Alyse was wrapped in towels by the fire having the tangles combed from her hair. </p>\r\n<p>"Help yourself," the woman nodded toward the pot of tea sitting on the table. "There''s fresh water in the bath and clean clothes on the back of the chair," she threw over her shoulder as, having finished her braiding; she hustled Alyse from the room and closed the door. "Hurry now,” came the order from the other side of the wall. "We shan''t be long."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon had no trouble believing that and completed his ablutions as quickly as he could, keeping one ear tuned toward the door. He was just tucking the clean shirt into the top of his trousers, when there was a soft knock and the door opened. Alyse entered first, dressed in shirt and trousers that were at least two sizes bigger than those given to her by the knights but the woman had cleverly rolled and tucked them so that rather than appear ridiculous, Alyse looked quite enchanting. Embarrassed by the sudden flush of heat in his cheeks, he bent his head to lace his boots. The tentative smile on Alyse’s lips faded and she slipped silently onto one of the chairs. The woman sat beside her and softly patted her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Now then," the brisk, no-nonsense voice brought both heads up. "Perhaps we should get acquainted? My name is Eiva."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon burst out laughing. He could not help it. This woman had stripped them, bathed them, clothed, fed and taken complete control over their every movement for the entire morning... and now... she thought they should get acquainted! </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s mug banged sharply next to his elbow and he coughed back his laughter under her disapproving stare. </p>\r\n<p>"Please, forgive me," he apologised to Eiva. Though his words were sincere, he could not master the silly grin that twitched at the corner of his mouth. "Without a doubt Mother Eiva, you are a gem amongst women &mdash; both for your hospitality and your wit. My name is Cymon," he said offering his hand, "this is Alyse and the boy is her brother, Jarok."</p>\r\n<p>"Pleased I''m sure," Eiva smiled at them both.</p>\r\n<p>"We''re on our way home to... " Cymon stopped short and looked across at Alyse with surprise. Curiosity became edged with unease in Eiva’s breast as the two of them seemed to engage in some sort of silent argument until Cymon inclined his head as though in deference to Alyse’s will. Eiva held her breath, a little afraid now and not knowing what to expect as the air about Cymon began to shimmer. Cymon’s illusion faded and his Elfin nature was revealed. Eiva’s eyes popped and she almost fell off her chair. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, I''ll be,” she exclaimed, clapping her hands to her cheeks and puffing alarmingly.</p>\r\n<p>“One of the fey folk! Alive and well and in my kitchen!”</p>\r\n<p>Alyse quickly poured her some tea, stirred in a little extra honey and sat beside her holding her hand while Cymon told their tale.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry for frightening you and for the subterfuge but now that you know the reasons, I''m sure you understand." </p>\r\n<p>"Indeed, indeed," murmured Eiva, her composure regained by the time he had finished. She went to the fire and swung the kettle across. Cymon and Alyse watched her quietly, sensing she needed this time to unravel her thoughts, while she went outside to empty the pot then spooned in fresh leaves before adding the hot water and bringing it to the table.</p>\r\n<p>"A strange tale though. Unbelievable, many would say." she paused, filling the mugs and taking her seat. "But you''re sitting there, the evidence of it. And more to it still, I shouldn''t wonder," she added perceptively. Her eyes narrowed slightly as her fingers ran thoughtfully around the rim of her mug. She heaved a sigh. "It would certainly explain some of the weird goings on of late. Only last week I found a dead cat, up on the river bank." She looked up at Alyse. "Nothing strange about that, you''d think, except this looked like it had been dead for weeks and I''d only given it some milk myself the evening before! Not much left but a few bones and its collar. Poor Petra,” she shook her head sadly, her gaze drifting through the window to the cottage over the way. "I haven''t had the heart to tell her yet. Pure doted on that cat since her husband disappeared no more than a month since. Said he was going to market and never came back. Run off with some floozy we thought, he always did like the ladies...&nbsp;but now I wonder? Yes, strange happenings indeed." She lifted her mug to her lips.</p>\r\n<p>"The man on the bridge? Sylo. What''s his story?" Cymon asked her.</p>\r\n<p>"Troublemaker,” spat Eiva contemptuously. "Him and his wife both. Turned up here last autumn...&nbsp;from the city they said, though never which one. Looking for peace and quiet. Huh! Not had a lick of that since. Oh, they were friendly enough to fool most of the villagers at first, but not me. I always thought there was something shifty about them. They started spreading stories about this one and that and blaming others for it. Suddenly, people who had known each other all their lives weren''t speaking. They had arguments nearly every day &mdash; backbiting and jealousies. D''you know, some of the men actually set to fighting? I''ve lived here forty years. Couldn''t live in a friendlier place. "Now," her face screwed up in disgust, "no-one hardly ever steps foot outside their doors anymore and if they meet... they act like strangers! Fair breaks my heart, so it does." she sighed.</p>\r\n<p>"What d''you think?" Cymon turned to Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"It is quite possible that this Sylo is Duman’s servant. From the encounter on the bridge and what Eiva says, he certainly has all the attributes."</p>\r\n<p>"But what could be important about this little village, for Duman to send him here?" Cymon wondered aloud.</p>\r\n<p>"The bridge, or the river itself perhaps? But then, Duman could have hundreds... thousands... of such men all over Rohansuk, for no other reason than to divide the people."</p>\r\n<p>"That''s an awful lot of people to maintain control over," said Cymon. "Is that possible?"</p>\r\n<p>"Maybe the shadows do it," offered a sleepy voice from the doorway. Jarok shuffled across the room, yawned and slipped onto Alyse’s lap.</p>\r\n<p>"What shadows dear?" Alyse prompted softly, stroking his forehead.</p>\r\n<p>"The one looking over his shoulder," he replied, rubbing his eyes and yawning again.</p>\r\n<p>"What did it look like?" asked Cymon, jumping in before Alyse could stop him.</p>\r\n<p>"What did what look like?" Jarok turned bemused eyes to Cymon. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse shook her head, warning Cymon not to press as the elfs'' mouth opened. The moment was gone. Jarok was no longer aware of what he had seen or said. </p>\r\n<p>''Do you know what he''s talking about?'' Cymon asked Alyse silently.</p>\r\n<p>''No. I saw nothing...&nbsp;but then I was not looking for anything.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Perhaps he just imagined it.'' It was a hopeful thought more to himself than to her, he had enough on his plate right now.</p>\r\n<p>''If Jarok said he saw a shadow, then he saw one," she replied firmly.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s eyes flickered in surprise, not at the hint of anger that coloured her thoughts, but with the sense that she used it deliberately to thrust a wall between them. Eiva watched them both thoughtfully. How, she could not fathom but she was sure they were having some kind of conversation. It unnerved her somewhat and she stood, ruffled Jarok’s hair and picked him up.</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s get some clothes on you, young man... before you catch your death of cold." </p>\r\n<p>As soon as they were alone, Cymon began to speak but Alyse placed a hand over his mouth. He raised his eyes and hands to the ceiling but he did not press her. Her grateful smile was reward enough for his patience.</p>\r\n<p>Later, after Jarok had woken fully and they had all enjoyed a small but satisfying lunch, Cymon and Alyse tried desperately to convince Eiva to move somewhere safer. But she was adamant. </p>\r\n<p>"My Zak carried me over this threshold the day we wed... and here I''m staying,” she insisted stubbornly. "Man, beast nor weather has been able to drive me away yet... and neither will any wizard," and argued that if things were as bad as they said, then she was as safe there as anywhere. Cymon and Alyse were as convinced to the opposite but it was her choice. She did at least promise to be more careful and to stay well away from Sylo and his wife. </p>\r\n<p>"Isn''t there anything you can do," Jarok anxiously asked Alyse. Alyse was about to tell him no when she frowned and closed her eyes. Her head tilted to one side and her bottom lip disappeared behind her teeth. Jarok had often seen her thus when she was preparing some medicine or other for one of the villagers. He smiled to himself. She would come up with something, she always did. </p>\r\n<p>Sure enough she opened her eyes and asked him for the Anquas root. Clasping it tightly in both hands, she averted her face so as not to alarm Eiva before inner lids slid open. Cymon smiled reassuringly at an apprehensive Eiva as light streamed from between Alyse’s fingers. When the light faded and inner lids closed, Alyse turned back to Eiva and gave her the root. </p>\r\n<p>"Cut it into five pieces," Alyse instructed the bemused woman. "Plant one piece at each corner of the cottage. Come morning, the first leaves will have appeared. Snip them off and store them safely, the healing properties they contain are very strong and you may have need of them. One leaf in a full kettle and boiled, will provide enough medicine for at least fifty people."</p>\r\n<p>Eiva’s eyes widened in disbelief, she had never heard of anything so potent. </p>\r\n<p>"The fifth piece," Alyse continued, "steep overnight in water and a little earth from each place the others are planted. Pour the liquid about the walls and as far to the bridge as you are able. Bury the root there. Check the plants around the cottage regularly. When evil threatens they will begin to grow again. You will have until they are waist high, half a morning maybe less, then they will spread thick and fast. Gather all whom you hold dear and trust inside. I would suggest you start laying in provisions now, there may not be enough time later. The plants will wither when the immediate danger has passed. After that, you must leave this place," insisted Alyse, squeezing the older woman’s'' arm. "Promise me, that you will do this."</p>\r\n<p>They were by far, the oddest set of instructions Eiva had ever heard and had it not been for the fervent plea in Alyse’s eyes she might have thought it some kind of joke. She looked across at Cymon. His face too held the same earnest request. Even Jarok nodded at her sagely. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, it''s all beyond me, I have to say," she said quietly, scratching her grey head and pretending a calmness she was far from feeling. "But if that''s what you''ll have me do, then I''ll do it. There, there dear, I''ll be right as rain," she rubbed Alyse’s back as she got to her feet to hug the old woman. A little overwhelmed by the emotional display, Eiva urged her back to her seat and took refuge in her usual briskness. "Let''s see about your lot then. Your quickest route through False Ridge would be the River Run, of course. It''s costly, but most people use it because it''s patrolled by its own Peacekeepers and offers safe passage. No doubt this wizard knows this too and if you''re trapped in there there''s nowhere to run. He would also know that the alternative would usually be to skirt the Ridge. But... " She paused on a secretive smile, "I know another route. Old. Secret. May not be as quick as taking the river but it''ll cut your time in half from going around and be much safer." She gave them directions and a name. "Tell him I sent you and said ''Redeye''."&nbsp;She laughed at their bemused expressions. "His grandparents used to live in Sylo’s cottage. Ador and his sisters would come down to visit in the summer and we''d all go scrumping in Farmer Redocks orchard. Redeye was the watchword. He''ll remember and help you if he can."</p>\r\n<p>"What''s scrumping?" Jarok piped curiously.</p>\r\n<p>"It is a means of gathering apples," answered Alyse vaguely. "Now run along outside and find Royle, we shall be leaving shortly."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok disappeared, followed by barking dogs, a squeal of laughter and more barking.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure you can''t stay a while longer?" Eiva asked wistfully. "It''s been a long time since this old place was filled with a child’s laughter."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry," answered Cymon, "but we have to keep moving. We still have a long way to go and besides, we''ve already put you in considerable danger for having stayed this long."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not worried about myself none," Eiva waved away his concern just as she had Alyse’s. </p>\r\n<p>"You should be," he insisted.</p>\r\n<p>"Pff! I''ve lived a full and happy life. But you... you''re still so young, with so much to look forward to. You just concentrate on taking care of yourselves, the dogs will look after me... and this of course," she picked the Anquas root up off the table and put it in a jar on the mantel. "It''ll be safe there for the present," she assured Alyse. "Now, if you''re that set on moving on, let''s get you shifted while there''s still some daylight left!" She took a sack from the box under the window and began filling it until they protested that she would have nothing left for herself. After a further rummage in the box she pressed six coppers into Alyse’s hand before disappearing into the bedroom and coming out with a long, oilskin bundle, which she laid across the table. Unwrapping a broadsword and scabbard, she passed them to Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"That weapon of yours looks dangerous enough but I think you''ll find this more useful and easier to wield. Please... take it," she insisted as Cymon hesitated. "Zak would be pleased to know it was serving a good cause rather than gathering dust under the bed."</p>\r\n<p>Though she spoke lightly of it, Cymon knew by the excellent condition in which she had maintained both blade and scabbard that it was in fact, very dear to her. But she refused to take ''No'' for an answer and so he accepted, promising to wield it with the honour it deserved. On a sudden impulse he kissed her soundly on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"Away with you,” she laughed self-consciously even as she beamed with pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>"May I?" </p>\r\n<p>Eiva turned and saw Jarok holding the matching short sword and belt. Gone was the poor bedraggled waif that had first entered her kitchen. Gone was the young, innocent child she had tucked up into her bed; the fey child, curled bemused on his sister’s lap after the ''touch'' had left him; the playful child that had just been romping about the garden with the dogs. Before her now stood a completely new facet of his compelling, yet endearing character. As erect and proud as the elf beside whom he stood, he stared up at her with eyes as strong and serious as any Man’s. The intensity and depth of his gaze a heartbreaking contrast to the young, not yet fully defined features. She drew a deep breath, moved by it and the memory of the last time someone had stood on the same spot holding that very sword.</p>\r\n<p>''Duty calls!'' Zak had quipped, holding it out for her to strap on. The words had fallen lightly from her husbands'' lips but his eyes had been filled with that same unspoken seriousness. </p>\r\n<p>''If I don''t come back, remember I love you!'' those eyes had cried, almost as if he had known somehow. For that time he did not come back &mdash; just the two swords and a letter full of meaningless platitudes from a stranger. Tears welled up inside and her chin trembled. Her face tightened as she hardened her heart against the memories. Misinterpreting her manner, Jarok’s face fell with disappointment. He replaced the sword slowly back onto the oilskin with a muttered apology for having taken it. </p>\r\n<p>"Of course, you may have it. We’ll need to put another notch in though" she did her best to smile cheerfully as she swung the belt about Jarok’s waist and buckled it, shifting it until the sword hung comfortably by his side. "There now, and don''t you look all grown up? I couldn''t be more proud if you were my own son." </p>\r\n<p>"I''ll come back and see you, I promise," Jarok threw his arms about her neck and she kissed the top of his head as she held onto him tightly.</p>\r\n<p>"Stay safe, my child," she whispered as she let him go.</p>\r\n<p>"Eiva? Are you alright?" Alyse drew her gently back into the room when she made to follow Cymon and Jarok outside.</p>\r\n<p>"Take no never minds’ of me," she sniffed, blew her nose and wiped her eyes. "I''m just a foolish old woman. Come on now, best not to keep the men folk waiting or they''ll realise they''re not really in charge at all!" she joked.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s so funny?" asked Cymon, as they appeared, laughing, arm in arm. Alyse and</p>\r\n<p>Eiva looked at each another and laughed anew. Eiva accompanied them to the bridge, to ensure they crossed without interference. Defiant, flanked either side by the two dogs cleared the way. As they neared Sylo’s cottage, Alyse caught a glimpse of the man behind the curtains. Sylo ducked out of sight but not quickly enough for Alyse to have missed the hatred in his eyes as he glared at Eiva. What disturbed her even more was the dark malice that shimmered about him and seemed to tint his skin an unhealthy grey. She reached out delicately. Though she knew it would be so, it was with sadness that she discovered not even the tiniest hint of goodness in the man. He was black with evil. Taking great care, she crept to the very edge of Sylo’s consciousness and there found a presence even darker than the blackness of the man himself. Already, the thing possessed him, though he knew it not. She withdrew quickly before it sensed her probing but not before she discovered that there were many, many more like Sylo.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok was right," she warned in a hurried whisper, placing an urgent hand on Eiva’s arm. "Sylo is possessed, there may be even less time than we have realised. You must begin preparing the root as soon as we are gone. Please Eiva...&nbsp;be very careful!"</p>\r\n<p>"I will dear, I promise." Eiva returned her tight hug and then held her horse while she mounted. With a final quick goodbye, they cantered off. Jarok stopped at the bend in the road, turned and waved. Eiva waved back as hard as she could, her heart heavy. The road ahead was not the only empty space he left behind. Slowly pulling her shawl back over her head, she whistled the dogs and set off back over the bridge. </p>\r\n<p>Sure that Sylo would be watching she screwed up face, turned to his window and poked out her tongue. It was silly and childish and she knew Alyse would be angry with her for antagonizing him but she could not resist. To her delight Sylo was there and his face turned a mottled purple as he gestured wildly at her. She laughed as the dogs ran barking to his door and he jumped back from sight. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s a beautiful day to be alive,” she cried cheerfully and feeling suddenly ''girlish'', flung her arms out and twirled until she was dizzy. The dogs looked from their mistress to the great, dark clouds banking in the eastern sky and then back at each other. One of them grunted down its nose at her strange behaviour and stepped closer to her mistress. The other, ever hopeful, raced ahead to sit and wait, tail wagging, beside his bowl. </p>\r\n</div>', 1, 21, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(24, 'Dumans children', 'CHAPTER TWELF', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="T" src="T.gif">wice, the shift of balance broke Duman’s concentration. He was not amused. But then very little amused him anyway, other than inflicting pain. The first imbalance he had ignored. It had been no more than a flicker and really, he would have been more worried had the girl not made an attempt to ''test her wings''. Twice in one day was too much however and the second jolt had been more than mere muscle flexing. He was disturbed by the length of time it had lasted and the extent of the fluctuating wave it had caused. It was impossible to carry on enjoying himself until he knew what she had done. Aggravation lit the fuse on his always-short temper. Work or play, he detested being disturbed. It really was too much...&nbsp;things had just begun to get interesting!<p></p>\r\n<p>"Later,” he promised the quivering mass of pinky-white jelly suspended in the grey, liquid force field that hovered before him and swiped it out of his way. The flowing bubble scooted across the room, bounced off the opposite wall and veered left, where it ricocheted up towards the ceiling, all the while gathering momentum. Fascinated by the effect the speeding movements were having upon its occupant, Duman’s eyes followed the bubbles'' course as it careered faster and faster around the room. Then, before he could stop it, it glanced against the black, runic candle burning on the floor. The candle toppled over, spilling its flame carelessly onto the carefully sprinkled powder of the pentagram. The powder flared brilliantly for an instant, then burnt to nothing. So too did the force field, which had by now risen back up to the ceiling. For a second the jellied mass hung there and then it fell straight down, landing with a splattering ''plop'' in a disgusting glob on the floor. It writhed and squirmed, like a fish out of water, then began to congeal until it had set hard as a rock. Duman was furious. Hogeth had much more fun left in him. Centuries of entertainment ruined.</p>\r\n<p>"Curses,” he spat, swiping an angry kick at the mass. It remained unmoved. Duman bent and rubbed at his throbbing toes. It''s all your fault,” he cursed the candle laying under his nose, grabbing it off the floor and pinching out the still burning flame. Even as he broke the candle into tiny pieces and threw them across the room, he knew it was a futile gesture. He watched the pieces slowly draw themselves together again and stormed out of the room seething with frustration.</p>\r\n<p>By the time he reached the Summoning Chamber he was in a vile temper. As usual, it was Kretos that bore the brunt of it when Duman discovered there was no chair there. It did not matter that he had been the cause of it himself, or that Kretos was unable to pass the runic wards set upon the room to replace it. All that mattered was that Duman needed a release for his anger and Kretos was there. The chair was as good an excuse as any! Bloodied and limping, Kretos hurried off to find a replacement, only to be subjected to another vicious assault on his return. The door slammed in his face and he made his way painfully back down the corridor muttering a tirade of silent curses down upon the wizards head.</p>\r\n<p>On the other side of the door, Duman dragged the chair across the room and positioned it carefully beside the table. He sat and began his mental preparations. Exhaling the last of his inner turmoil, he called forth the purple mist that was the essence of Baroth. As always, it came reluctantly, filtering in on a single tendril. Refusing to be goaded, Duman waited until the Orb was filled, then began siphoning off some of the Dragon’s power. At first, Baroth would release only a trickle of what Duman demanded but as the wizard exerted his control, Baroth was forced to loosen his hold. Duman felt the power surge through his veins and was lost in a moments'' exhilaration and a feeling of invincibility that he longed to be his forever but he knew that as soon as took his hands from the Orb, it would be gone. Oh, how he longed for the day it would be his completely! </p>\r\n<p>Forcing himself to remain focused he began calling upon the many runes at his command. The first materialized in a smoky-grey block before him. He held it steady while he called a second and threaded them together with bindings of purple filament. One after another he summoned the runes, interlocking each with the Dragon’s power until they formed a wall. The purple chain strained against the black runes, threatening to tear the wall apart. Duman’s hand clenched upon the surface of the Orb and his mind barked out a command for obedience. Baroth had no option but to comply with the mystical authority and as his resistance crumbled, the wall ceased its convulsions and settled, firm and steady. Duman grinned as the purple essence coiled into a tight ball at the Orb’s centre, removing itself as far away from the inner surface, and Duman’s touch, as was possible in the confined and limited space. Preparations complete, Duman summoned the Watchers. </p>\r\n<p>The room behind the wall grew hazy. The objects existing within the material world began to phase in and out and finally disappeared altogether, giving way to a long, dim tunnel stretching back into the infinite realms of the astral dimension. Its obscure length was lined, five abreast, with rank upon rank of ghostly figures &mdash; inky forms... without features and with very little substance, creatures of the psyche. Creations of Hurian knowledge that Duman had improved upon and that dwelt on the astral plane seeking, recruiting, controlling and possessing in various degree, subjects who were found to have the qualities of spirit (that being inherent darkness) that would make them both receptive and useful to Duman. And of course, once said subjects had outlived their usefulness, the Watchers would ultimately dispose of them. Duman’s only problem was that these creatures had no individual identity and so he was unable to summon a specific Watcher. Instead, he had to summon all those in a specific location. In this instance he did not even have that, all he had was Lower Westbrooke. That meant an awful lot of Watchers, each of which he would have to interrogate individually.</p>\r\n<p>Resigning himself to the tedious, time consuming process and the inevitable strain on his patience it would entail, he removed his right hand from the Orb and reached through the wall to beckon the first one forward. The sands of time trickled laboriously from glass to glass as Duman questioned the endless ranks of Watchers, all to no avail. How many he had been through he had lost count of before finally, with his temper strung out at the end of its tether, he struck upon something promising. A man named Sylo had, but a short while earlier, had a confrontation with a group matching the description of those he sought. Using this information he was able to narrow his search and dismiss many of the still waiting creatures. From those that were left, he had greater luck and had only questioned about twenty or so before he learned of the Knights. Calling themselves the Order of the Dragon, they were stirring the people up for war and they bore strange marks upon their arms, which they were using to convince the people of their words. They called it ''The Dragonmark''.</p>\r\n<p>"That accounts for one disturbance," Duman said to himself. "But which one?" </p>\r\n<p>Had he realised exactly the nature of the Dragonmark, he could have answered the question and would have been livid to discover that Alyse had been giving away the power that he considered being his own. But he did not know and in calm ignorance called forth the next Watcher. </p>\r\n<p>Again he was told of the Knights, two of them sighted near the town of Eihaven. The Watcher''s possessed had sent two of his sons to dispose of those troublemakers but the sons had not returned. The merchant (for such was the Man’s trade) feared the worst and now baulked at the idea of sending his remaining sons after them. Duman told the Watcher to dispose of the merchant and the rest of his family. </p>\r\n<p>After questioning a few more and discovering nothing new that pertained to his interests, Duman decided to call it a day. Sending out his instructions, he dismissed the ranks of Watchers who walked off into the dark recesses of the tunnel. A series of hand gestures caused the tunnel to collapse in upon itself and disappear and once the room had stabilized into the physical, Duman very carefully began unravelling the filaments that bound the wall. By reciting the runic identifications backwards, starting with the last and on up to the first, he gradually dismantled it. Once done, he placed his right hand back upon the Orb and released Baroth. Duman left the room mulling over all the information he had gathered. The mark bothered him. What was its purpose? Was it for identification? Was this evidence of truth?&nbsp;This seemed to be the manner of use to which the Knights were putting it. But was it something more?&nbsp;He could not ask the Dragons, such a question would mean revealing too much and in order to gain... what?&nbsp;He shrugged his shoulders. All he could do was wait and watch. He looked up. Ahead of him stood the stone figure of Ecos and he strode forward to pause beside it, tapping the mighty front horn with his nail.</p>\r\n<p>"So? You think to steal a march on me?" mocking laughter echoed down the corridor. "You''re about a hundred years too late, my friend! My minions are spread far and wide across this land, ready and waiting for my given word. Everything goes according to my plans."</p>\r\n<p>Actually his plans had been considerably upset but he would not admit this even to himself. He had not intended to turn upon the masses until the power was actually his, but to stride victoriously from Ak''thai with his army behind him and simply annihilate everything in his path. He had not actually planned for a war. Wars were so messy: all that fighting and killing, pain, blood, death, burning, rape and pillage, the torturing of prisoners for information. His heart beat faster. </p>\r\n<p>Perhaps a little war would be fun, after all!</p>\r\n<p>Sitting in his antechamber with his feet propped up on the hearth, he planned out his revised strategy. Ecos would of course, expect him to send an army up and out of the fortress and so had, no doubt, advised these Knights he had recruited accordingly...&nbsp;who would then, like obedient little soldiers, run off to tell their King. And the King would send the army Ecos expected... in due course! But before the clashing of these two forces, Duman had another army, known to none, who already had prepared access deep into Rohansuk. A campaign of terror and confusion should cause the populous to scream for protection and upset any of the enemies plans for orderly armament and defence. Their King would be forced to distribute his soldiers here, there and everywhere or risk an uprising. He went to the door and called for Kretos.</p>\r\n<p>"Go into the Grachenbahl," he ordered. "Find General G''narch. Tell him I want a headcount. I want to know the size of my army, to the last Gracht and sword. Then he is to move the all to the edge of the bogs and camp there. No dawdling or lazing about. I expect the army to be ready to march at a moments notice. Is that clear?" asked Duman.</p>\r\n<p>"I understand, m... master. B... b... but... " Kretos hesitated under Duman’s menacing stare.</p>\r\n<p>"But what?" Demanded Duman, taking a step closer.</p>\r\n<p>"I... I''ve never been to g... gr... grachenb, bahl b... before. I w... w... wouldn''t know w... w... where t...to look f... for the g... g... general... " Stammered Kretos.</p>\r\n<p>"Then you''d better learn... quickly," answered Duman, leaning in close to Kreto’s face, "because you only have a week to get there and back with the information. Is that clear?" He hooked his fingernail into one of Kreto’s nostrils. Kretos slapped his hand over his nose as blood spurted from the tear. Unable to trust himself to speak, Kretos nodded vigorously.</p>\r\n<p>"THEN GET OUT,” screamed Duman. "Unless you''re waiting for a matching pair?"</p>\r\n<p>Kretos ran from the chasing echoes of Duman’s humiliating laughter. Back inside the antechamber, Duman opened the lid of a large chest pushed into a corner of the room and removed three objects, which he placed carefully into a sack. He closed the lid and left the room. </p>\r\n<p>Down, up, round and back again... following the zigzag maze of stairs and corridors. Moving silently save for the soft swishing of his robe sweeping the cold, stone floor, he strode deliberately through the darkness. Never faltering or hesitating, he walked the rarely used route beneath the east wing of the fortress to the final flight of stairs that led, or so it appeared, to a dead end. Duman placed his hand upon the rock face and the telltale aura of magic shimmered across its surface. A single command set the rock wavering and an opening appeared. He stepped through, just far enough to allow it to close behind him. It was darker here than he remembered, not having been this way for many years. A soft glow appeared in his palm and he set it before him to light the way. Shifting the weight of the sack over his shoulder, he set off, the heat from the antechamber soon leaving his body in the cold, damp tunnel. He suppressed a shiver, pulling up the hood of his robe. </p>\r\n<p>The tunnel seemed endless as it twisted and turned along the natural formation of the rock, though the tunnel itself was not a natural occurrence. In the steepest sections it was possible to see the telltale marks of tools, where crude stairs had been chiselled out to aid the walkers'' descent. Moss and fungi grew avidly on the damp walls and ceiling and carpeted the wet stone beneath his feet making walking slippery and dangerous, especially so in those places where the path dropped off into nothingness. But Duman’s step did not falter, though he did occasionally concede to the need for safety by placing his free hand against the slimy wall for support. The further he descended, the smaller the tunnel became and it was often necessary for him to crouch over in order to pass through these lower depths where the air was hot and stale. Now he pulled down his hood and opened the neck of his robe. From up ahead came the steady sound of dripping water, echoing eerily through the otherwise silent tunnels with a mind-numbing monotonous regularity. It occurred to Duman as he listened to it (for he was ever alert to any means to develop his Arts) that it might prove fairly effective as a means of mental torture. It was certainly getting on his nerves! It grew louder and louder until, bending to pass under a particularly low overhang, he stepped into the source.</p>\r\n<p>The rhythmic dripping of moisture from the huge, stalactite formation on the ceiling of the cavern rippled across the surface of the pool beneath in ever-widening, interlocking circles. Set at wide intervals around the walls of the cavern, small braziers provided just enough light to break up the darkness. Duman set the glowing ball that had led him through the tunnels above his head. The occupants of this place might not need the light but he did. It was evident by the wet footprints that still lingered on the stone walkway encircling the pool that they had not long vacated the area. They had probably disappeared into one of the numerous tunnels leading off from this central cavern when they had heard him approaching.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t be afraid, my children," he called, wincing as his voice boomed like thunder off the rock. He lowered his tone. "Ishtak! Mitak! Bellak! Come! Bring my children</p>\r\n<p>out to me." </p>\r\n<p>This time his words rolled of the walls and ceiling in gentle invitation, prompting white faces to peek furtively from the security of the shadows. Duman smiled and beckoned them forward but they remained hidden. Suddenly they were shouldered aside by three, squat but muscular figures that strode forward with fearless confidence. Broad shoulders and barrel chests swayed in arrogant contrast to the childish slapping of huge, bare feet on wet stone. Thick, long arms reached down past their knees and if they were to bend but slightly, they could have walked comfortably on all fours. The exaggerated points of their ears poked through the coarse, bristly hair that covered their heads like a rucked-up rug and carried on down their cheeks in tapering sideburns. Duman could see, now that the cavern began to fill behind them, that those he had first spotted were females and children. No wonder they had refused his call. Apart from protecting their young, the females would never dare approach without permission from their mates. Now however, under the watchful eyes of the many males in the congregation, they flocked into the cavern.</p>\r\n<p>Ishtak, Mitak and Bellak came to a halt before Duman but they showed no cowering submission, no evidence of fearful minions before terrifying master that so marked all the wizard’s other relationships. On the contrary, these three stood, legs slightly apart and heads proud, with their large saucer-eyes staring openly and directly into his. Duman stared back, full of pride himself at the pleasing outcome of his endeavour. They were everything he had bred them to be. Short, round, ungainly and decidedly ugly, with those huge eyes and piggy noses underlined by fat lips. In fact, they were perfect: the very antithesis of the Elfin... just as he had intended. Actually, this could not be farther from the truth but rather than admit another in a long line of failures, Duman had convinced himself that this had been his intention all along thus giving him the opportunity to gloat, delighted by his achievement of perfection. How it would gall the Elfin when his children set their feet upon the world and they discovered that these monstrosities were of the same stock. </p>\r\n<p>They would have fits of vapours! </p>\r\n<p>Perhaps, if he were really lucky, they would all die of shock and shame. He smiled to himself at the idea. It was past time their pride and vanity were shattered. A large shovel of a hand in front of his face and a thick, harsh voice brought him out of his reverie.</p>\r\n<p>"Great Father. You honour us with presence. Has been long time." </p>\r\n<p>"Too long, Ishtak," replied Duman with an uncharacteristic tone of apology, taking the hand and allowing the back of his own to receive a sloppy, wet kiss. "Unfortunately, many other matters have demanded my attention. Everything is well here?"</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="GoblinGifts" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Goblin Gifts" src="GoblinGifts01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>"Yes, Great Father," affirmed Ishtak proudly, pulling his shoulders back even further in spite of his misshapen body. "Goblins be good children. Work hard. Have many young, like Father command. Prepare always for your word."</p>\r\n<p>"Goblins,” Duman luxuriated in the word. </p>\r\n<p>That too was perfect &mdash; the final insult. </p>\r\n<p>Because of the rigidity of the vocal chords in their thickly muscled necks, these creatures had great difficulty in pronouncing Elfin words, yet Duman had set out quite deliberately to teach them this language as their own...&nbsp;purely because of the perversion and ridicule that disfigured its melodic beauty.</p>\r\n<p>''Gûh bêy alliènne''...&nbsp;meaning ''sight of wondrous beauty''. </p>\r\n<p>These were the first words uttered by his original creation the moment it had laid eyes upon its mate. And she probably was... to him! However, because of the difficulty in pronunciation the words had come out as Go-be-lin. Amused by the irony, Duman had declared that this would the name of the new race of children that would inherit the land, as soon as he had rid it of his enemies. Yes. In feature and speech the Goblins were all he could have hoped for. Duman’s only remaining question as to their ultimate perfection was that of their nature. Thus far he had not had the opportunity to truly put it to the test. He returned to the present and the air of hushed expectancy as the gathered goblins waited to hear him speak. </p>\r\n<p>"Children! I come with good news. I have decided it is time for the world to meet you," he declared, waving his free hand over the heads of the crowd.</p>\r\n<p>"Time to hurt?" grinned Bellak.</p>\r\n<p>"Time to kill?" growled Mitak.</p>\r\n<p>"Time to feast?" slurped Ishtak.</p>\r\n<p>Duman nodded in reply to each question and suddenly the cavern was in uproar. Stamping feet, bellowing cheers and the sounds of flesh on flesh... be it their own or their neighbours, nobody cared. Their elation rose in a tumultuous din. Male and female alike bared sharp, pointed teeth as their fat lips curled back grotesquely in vicious, snarling grins. Bulging eyes glossed over with the spite-filled loathing he had taught them and turned blood red with the killing fever. Ishtak was the first to set up the low, bestial growl resonating deep in his throat but one by one, the others picked it up until the very rock throbbed to the sound. Here in part, was an answer to Duman’s concern as to their nature.</p>\r\n<p>Even diluted by many generations, it was clear that his blood still ran thick in their veins. He was exultant. All boded well...&nbsp;or not... depending which side of the fence you were on!</p>\r\n<p>Laughing openly at his silent joke encouraged the congregation to even greater heights and he soon regretted his enthusiasm as the noise rose unbearably and he was forced to clap his hands over his ears. Immediately, Ishtak threw back his head and gave a mighty roar. The goblins ceased their cries but it took a while longer for the resounding echoes to gradually fade away. Duman raised his hand in a gesture that encompassed the whole crowd.</p>\r\n<p>"You may indeed do all these things... though for the present... only when and where I tell you."</p>\r\n<p>There was a wave of disappointed rumbling at his words. Ishtak turned and silenced the crowd with a stern glare, then faced Duman and nodded obediently.</p>\r\n<p>"Let us move to the Council Chamber where I can address you all properly," said Duman.</p>\r\n<p>Ishtak led the way, followed by Duman, with Mitak and Bellak behind keeping the multitude at a respectable distance. The tunnels were overflowing but all along the way the goblins parted to allow Duman through. Some of the females fell to their knees and he patted them fondly on their heads as he passed. Instantly these lucky few were surrounded by their neighbours anxious to claim friend or kinship for (as Ishtak explained to his query) the touch of the Great Father had raised the status of these females tenfold. Duman watched them with great amusement and patted more than he may otherwise have done. When they arrived at the Council Chamber, Duman stopped short. The procession behind him backed up in a series of grunts, moans and curses but Duman was too amazed by the massive forum ahead of him to take any notice of the chaos behind. Mitak and Bellak however were not and there were a few cracked heads before order was restored to their satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>The goblins have indeed been busy, Duman observed with immense pleasure. When he had last stood upon the dais in the centre of this room, there had been but a few rows of seats. Now there was tier upon tier of stone benches, cut into circular walls that grew ever wider and higher and raised the ceiling so high it was hard to see. </p>\r\n<p>"In more ways than one," he breathed in an amused whisper, as filing onto these benches came hundreds upon hundreds of goblins. "Can it truly have been that long?"</p>\r\n<p>In the front rows sat the Leaders of the various tribes, the Generals and those (he assumed) considered venerable by way of age. Behind these sat their mates and children. Next came ranks of other males according to their status and finally, almost on the ceiling, came the females and children. All of them moved quickly and in a surprisingly ordered fashion until, despite its massive size, the room was full and those without designated places were left to jostle and hustle for position in the crammed doorway and just beyond. </p>\r\n<p>It was already growing hot in the chamber with so many excited bodies packed so closely together and Duman found himself grateful for the great height of the ceiling into which the rising smell of thousands of sweating bodies drifted. He wondered if he was to look up, whether it would be hanging there in a stinking, yellow cloud preparing to rain down on them with great droplets of sweat. He resisted the urge to look. Instead he put down the sack and lifted both arms wide. The curious buzzing that filled the room ceased as he stepped onto the dais and turned in a circle to spread his benign and fatherly gaze upon the congregation.</p>\r\n<p>"My children," he began. "You have worked hard. I am proud of you all."</p>\r\n<p>The room erupted in cheers.</p>\r\n<p>"Silence,” bellowed Ishtak. "Silence for Great Father!"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, I''m most pleased. You have worked diligently, according to my instructions and indeed have surpassed all my expectations. You''ve not grown lazy, but waited with industrious patience for my return. Now is the time to reap the rewards that I promised you. You are to leave these tunnels and take your proper place in the world."</p>\r\n<p>Again the room erupted. </p>\r\n<p>"To begin with however, only a few chosen groups shall step forth... "</p>\r\n<p>This time there was a loud murmuring of disappointment.</p>\r\n<p>"... But soon you shall all feast upon the flesh of our enemies!" </p>\r\n<p>The groans became cheers again, interspersed by cries of ''Manflesh! Manflesh!''</p>\r\n<p>High in one of the uppermost tiers a young female, well past mating age yet still in the ranks of children, turned her questioning gaze to her mother.</p>\r\n<p>"How we enemies of those we never met?" she asked in all innocence.</p>\r\n<p>Her mother cast a terrified eye around her to see if any of her neighbours had heard the traitorous remark. To her relief they were all too enthralled by Duman’s speech to be taking any notice of them. Even the sound of the sharp slap as she cuffed her wayward daughter heavily about the ear and the child’s'' subsequent reaction, failed to impinge upon the concentration of those about her. Grabbing the child’s'' purpling ear in a spiteful grip the mother lowered her head.</p>\r\n<p>"This why none want," she hissed. "Not mate soon...&nbsp;get rid," and she sliced her finger across the child’s'' throat.</p>\r\n<p>The child sat bemused, rubbing her stinging ear and trying desperately to hold back the tears. She really did not understand what she had said that was so wrong. She sniffed and instantly felt her Mother’s grasp on the back of her neck. She cowered into her seat. She was already going to get a sound beating when the meeting was over, if her mother saw her tears it would be worse. Goblins did not cry. Such a thing was a sign of poor, weak blood and there was only one cure... death... and she was already on a warning for that. She bit her tongue and tried to concentrate on what was happening down on the floor of the chamber.</p>\r\n<p>"So how far do the tunnels extend?" Duman was asking one of the Leaders. </p>\r\n<p>The goblin rose and stepped onto the dais where he unrolled a large parchment on the floor.</p>\r\n<p>"According to Great Fathers'' map... and to best of calculations... we have exits here, at this place called Perrahove. Here, on southern edge of Firstoak Forest. Here and here, at Cotley Bridge and Fishers Wharf. This one," his face hardened as he paused for a moment and stared up into the gallery, "this one, am ashamed to say, has not progressed as it ought and is far short of target." The goblins'' finger tapped the map in Fellamund, to the east of Rohansuk.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst Duman had been absorbing this information, he had also listened with interested surprise at the fluency of this goblins'' speech. He had thought perhaps it was due to practise, since his white hair and supporting stick denoted a great age, however, when another of similar appearance spoke from some rows back, Duman realised that the goblins had obviously developed some type of caste system, wherein the ruling classes received whatever passed for education and the workers did not.</p>\r\n<p>"Rock hard this place, Great One," the new speaker began. "Not know rock. Shiny black. Red vein. Tools break. Not cut. No go through. No go round. Am bad goblin. Let Great Father down." The old goblin dropped back into his seat, head bowed in shame, his huge hands shaking in his lap. </p>\r\n<p>Duman recognised his description of the rock immediately and shook his head. Henocite! No wonder the goblin had been unable to make any headway. Nothing short of an earthquake could make a dent in it... except magic. The Fellis had tried for centuries to discover a tool that would allow them to mine this precious commodity (a fortress built of Henocite would be impregnable and others would pay whatever was asked for such a one) but eventually they had conceded defeat and abandoned the idea. The only time Henocite was used was when, after an earth disturbance, a few chips might be discovered which could be set in some metal or other and sold as jewellery. The rarity of such occurrences dictated that it was wealthy person indeed who owned a piece of Henocite! Duman looked up at the old goblin, still wrestling with his shame, and noticed how those seated near to him had edged away, disassociating themselves from him lest their own status be affected by his failure. For some strange reason, Duman found himself irked by their actions. He beckoned the old goblin to rise.</p>\r\n<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Teklok. Chief of Tunnellers."</p>\r\n<p>"Well, Teklok," smiled Duman. "Don''t be disheartened. I know the rock you''re speaking of and it comes as no surprise to me to hear of your problems. Even I wouldn''t be able to break through." This was not strictly true but Duman was not averse to a lie or two when it suited him and right now it suited him, to teach a few goblins a lesson in loyalty. "I''ve no doubt that you tried your best to fulfil my wishes. That''s all I ever ask. Now tell me, are you able to break through to the surface at your present position?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, Great Father... " Began Teklok. </p>\r\n<p>"No! No! Not from there," Duman interrupted him gently. "I can barely hear you. Come... take your place on the front row where we can talk properly." </p>\r\n<p>He waved Teklok down, noting with amused satisfaction, the looks of dismay that passed over the faces of the goblins'' once-neighbours. Not only had they missed out on an amazing status raising opportunity but also by their earlier rejection of him, they had actually severely damaged what status they already had. They would have lost less had they supported him! Desperate to repair the damage, they made friendly overtures to Teklok as he edged along the row but Teklok was not in a forgiving mood and gave them no quarter, turning his back upon the forced grins and reaching hands and sneering into the pleading glances as he strutted down the aisle. Listening to the uneasy shuffling coming from the upper tiers, Duman had an idea there would be some major revisions of the seating arrangements come the next Council meeting! </p>\r\n<p>His journey from the upper tiers completed, Teklok’s spurt of confidence drained away and he hesitated awkwardly by the vacant space made available on the end of the front seat, not quite sure what to do next.</p>\r\n<p>"Sit! Sit,” urged Duman, pressing down gently on Teklok’s shoulders. "Now. Tell me."</p>\r\n<p>"Can go up. Through... round... big problem," frowned Teklok. "Up... easy,” he snapped his fingers and gave Duman a huge grin. Duman’s mouth creased up in response; there was something about this old goblin that he truly liked, which was saying a lot for Duman did not particularly like anything. He leant forward and took Teklok’s hands. Even for a goblin they were rough and calloused. Ingrained with dirt and grease. He squeezed them tightly before letting go. </p>\r\n<p>"Well done. I''m very proud of you," he said. </p>\r\n<p>The agitated stirring amidst the front-rank occupants made Duman realise the danger he had unwittingly placed Teklok in. With all the personal attention Duman had been lavishing on him, Teklok’s status would by now, be up there tapping on the heels of the Leaders and Generals themselves... and that would not make them very happy at all. Though none, of course, would dare take away what Duman himself had bestowed, it was altogether possible that Teklok might meet with some unfortunate ''accident''... after all... he was not as young as he used to be and his line of work could be quite hazardous at times. Duman could almost read these thoughts upon the faces of those around him. He cast a knowing glance around the chamber, raising his voice so that all might hear his words of warning.</p>\r\n<p>"I shall look forward to speaking with you again on my next visit, Teklok."</p>\r\n<p>"Mitak guard,” announced Mitak, almost immediately (obviously knowing his own kind better than Duman) and pulling a jagged-edged dagger from his belt, moved to stand protectively in the aisle next to where Teklok sat. Duman nodded his approval. Teklok’s position now well and truly assured a noisy commotion arose in the upper tiers where a gnarled old female was defying the angry hands that tried to drag her back down onto her seat.</p>\r\n<p>"Mate of Teklok," whispered Ishtak.</p>\r\n<p>Duman understood at once and immediately waved her down. Instantly her path was cleared and a place made for her behind her mate. She lifted her nose to the unfriendly; yet status necessary; fawning stares of her new neighbours as she proudly took her seat. Teklok turned and gave her a disapproving glance but she glowered back unrepentantly. It was her right to take her place behind him and she was not going to be denied it!</p>\r\n<p>After a short pause to allow everyone to settle back down, Duman continued with the days'' proceedings. Having ascertained the readiness of the tunnels, he began his questioning as to the readiness of the goblins.</p>\r\n<p>"All males aged ten and upwards have regular exercise. Train in all weapons. Teach all best killing points. Teeth are best on neck,” one of the generals informed him, snapping his jaws together with an enthusiastic grin. </p>\r\n<p>"Females ready also, " cried another, snapping to her feet. Duman’s eyebrows raised in surprise. The fact she was female did not concern Duman himself but it seemed at odds with the goblins'' caste society. The many disapproving faces confirmed his thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>"General Ishkat," announced Ishtak with a note of defiant pride. "Has killed many to earn place and status... and right to speak cause of her kind!" Ishtak’s speech was plainly in defence of an old argument and was directed at the Council rather than himself, Duman realised when Ishtak adopted the posture of the ''Challenge''...&nbsp;legs apart, back slightly bowed, teeth bared and fist thrust out, narrowed eyes daring anyone to touch fists and accept. Duman knew the female general was Ishtak’s mate. Not because he had sprung to her defence but because of her name. According to their customs, females were not named at birth. Having no rank or status, they did not officially exist until they were chosen to be mated. Only then were they acknowledged as members of goblin society and even then, only as an extension of the male from whom they were named by means of inverting the second syllable. </p>\r\n<p>Duman wondered if Ishtak would have supported this females'' cause had she not been his mate; somehow he doubted it. He turned his gaze back to Ishkat with her defiantly tilted head and a light in her eyes that out-glowed by far, that in the eyes of her mate. She was taller than most other females he had seen and also unlike any other, boasted a set of sideburns, albeit soft and downy ones. Broad of back and muscular of arm and leg, she was undoubtedly strong and fit... more so, he guessed (if looks were anything to go by) than some of the males in whose company she sat. Crossed bands on her chest held a number of silver, five-pointed stars that he recognised as smaller versions of the ancient Fellis, ''T''churan'', and slender throwing knives were slipped into straps around her wrists. Resting upon one hip was a Dwarven axe and on the other a weapon of the goblins'' own devising. With all these and the two daggers protruding from the tops of her boots, Ishkat struck a formidable and awe inspiring figure &mdash; one that few, judging by the nervous shift in gazes as she glared about her, were willing to confront. Duman could easily understand why Ishtak had been smitten by her.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly aware that everyone was waiting for him to speak... that his words would settle this argument once and for all... Duman deliberately remained silent a little longer. He could sense the mounting tension, especially from the front rows, and higher up he saw more than one female leaning forward, eager and anxious for his decision. He looked at Ishkat, chin high as she kept her eyes fixed now upon her mate, who in turn searched the masses for any sign that one would accept his challenge. The crowd however, had eyes only for Duman, who closed his eyes and rubbed his chin as though deep in contemplation. After a deep, dramatic sigh, he finally spoke and all around the chamber echoed a loud ''whoosh'' of held breath being expelled, followed by a hushed burst of excited whispering.</p>\r\n<p>"The females, you say?" Duman kept his voice deliberately bland.</p>\r\n<p>"More than half, Great Father," she nodded. Her eyes flashed, lips twisting in a sneer of satisfaction at the gasps of anger and disbelief coming from the male population. Obviously the majority of these females had been training secretly!</p>\r\n<p>"From what age?" he asked, still revealing nothing. </p>\r\n<p>"Take only females who already bear three young... two must be male."</p>\r\n<p>"That shows great initiative, General Ishkat. I am pleased by this," he paused to look her up and down. As well as by the guile, cunning and fearlessness of the action, he added silently, for he knew she had risked much in daring to poach these females from right under the noses of their mates. He clasped his hands behind his back and paced slowly back and forth with bowed head.</p>\r\n<p>"And how good are these females of yours?" he baited the trap.</p>\r\n<p>"I train," she answered simply, as though that were answer enough. </p>\r\n<p>Duman’s head snapped up.</p>\r\n<p>"Show me! Accept the ''Challenge''!" </p>\r\n<p>Duman had expected at least a slight hesitance... a glance... a word... after all the ''Challenge'' was a fight to the death and this was her mate, but to his delight and satisfaction she showed none, immediately tapping Ishtak’s fist with her own. The two goblins faced off. Jaws hanging and lips curled back, they growled at each other as they circled. Duman did not even see her pull the knives from her boots until they glinted in the torchlight. Ishtak too, had also drawn his weapon and they parried and thrust, closed in and drew apart. So in tune were their movements, Duman began to suspect he was being duped by some well-practised training manoeuvres, until Ishtak suddenly rushed forward thrusting upwards with his dagger. It was no feigned attack, Duman could tell by the determination on his face. Had his mate not been as swift to react, the knife would surely have lodged deep in her heart. As it was she only just managed to deflect it in time and when they drew apart she was bleeding badly from a deep wound in her shoulder. She paused, snarling viciously and flexing her shoulder to check its mobility. Ishtak began to come in again and she threw herself to the floor, rolling twice and slicing across his upper thigh as she sprang to her feet behind him. Ishtak spun on his good leg. His mate thrust quickly but he anticipated this and was ready for her, knocking her down with an elbow to the face. Blood spurted from her nose with the crunch of breaking bones. She kicked up hard between his legs as he dropped to pin her down and he staggered backwards, his teeth clenched over the ''oomph'' of pain forced out with all the breath from his body. Gasping for air, bent double, eyes watering, Ishtak struggled to regain his balance as his mate advanced to take up her advantage. As she swung at him, he grabbed her wrists in turn. Her teeth snapped at his face as he bent and bit her hand. One of her knives fell to the floor and part of her little finger with it. Ishtak brought his head round to bite at her other hand. She butted him full in the face, at the same kicking fiercely at his damaged leg and sending him sprawling to the floor. He held his grip and took her with him. </p>\r\n<p>It was hard to see who was doing what during the ensuing struggle but Duman could hear the sound of snapping teeth and connecting blows. It was Ishkat who came out on top, pinning her mate down with her knees on his upper arms and shoulders. She drew back her good arm. In a single movement the throwing knife strapped to her wrist slipped into her hand and slashed downwards. Had Duman’s own hand not been quicker, he knew she would have slit Ishtak’s throat without mercy. </p>\r\n<p>"ENOUGH!" </p>\r\n<p>"But he not finished,” cried Ishkat in bemusement.</p>\r\n<p>"It wasn''t my intent that either of you should be." Dumans answer confused Ishkat even more but it was not her place to question the Great Father. Duman pulled her to her feet and raised her arm aloft. "From henceforth, the Goblin army shall contain a female section!"</p>\r\n<p>Ishkat turned a triumphant sneer upon on the male generals before she punched her fist in the direction of the females going wild in the upper tiers. Duman smiled indulgently and allowed them to savour their victory for a while before calling Ishkat away from her adoring audience.</p>\r\n<p>"Go and have your wounds tended. When I''ve finished here, I''ll join you both in your quarters." </p>\r\n<p>Retrieving their weapons, Ishkat helped her mate to rise and supported him out of the chamber, accompanied by a mixed ovation of cheers, growls and stamping feet. They turned in the doorway to salute the crowd once more before they left. Calling the congregation back to order, Duman finished the business at hand quickly and then, led by Bellak and followed by the Leaders and Generals, made his way to Ishtak’s quarters.</p>\r\n<p>The place looked more like an armoury than a home, with weapons of all kinds lining the walls, hung on hooks from the ceiling and propped up in the corners. The only concession made to comfort was the small, fur-filled hollow in one corner that served as a bed. Duman took his place here while the others crouched down on the cold stone. Ishtak and Ishkat sat beside Duman on the furs and grinned when Duman asked how long their recovery would take.</p>\r\n<p>"Goblins heal quick. Good medithen,” a thick, black tongue poked out from between Ishkat’s teeth and slurped noisily across the open end of her severed finger. Duman was intrigued. It seemed they had evolved some kind of natural healing ability. He determined to investigate this at a later date but for now was satisfied by her assurance that they would not be out of action for long. He turned to the Generals.</p>\r\n<p>"Each of you shall choose forty of your best goblins. Divide yourselves equally between the five tunnels. Once the exits are opened, each group will move in a different direction. You will confine your attacks to small villages and settlements only &mdash; easy, random targets. Any sort of pattern to your movements will lead the enemy to the tunnels and that I don''t want," he warned. He looked at Teklok whom he had also ordered to join the group.</p>\r\n<p>"Can the exits be concealed well enough to avoid detection?"</p>\r\n<p>"Teklok hide good. No find...&nbsp;less fall in,” grinned Teklok.</p>\r\n<p>"Good! Pick four of your most skilled tunnel builders and instruct them. You, I want on the tunnel that opens to Perrahove. I''m counting on you Teklok." Despite his liking for the old goblin, Duman’s voice was thick with warning.</p>\r\n<p>"Teklok fix like never there. Teklok... Master Tunnel Builder,” he thumped himself on the chest proudly. </p>\r\n<p>"You may devise your own plans according to place and time," Duman resumed instructing the generals. "Torture if you will, feast if you''re hungry...&nbsp;but only if time allows," he emphasized by sweeping a finger around the group. "Whatever else you do, there are to be no survivors. Dead or wounded that can''t make it back are to be burnt. The aim is terror and panic. Nothing creates more fear in the hearts of men than the unknown...&nbsp;this I have learnt in my time. Return to the tunnels before dawn but if you find yourselves trapped outside remain hidden till nightfall... " </p>\r\n<p>He stopped short at the sight of their blank faces. Born and bred in the constancy of the dark tunnels they had no idea of the concept of day and night. Whispering under his breath, Duman blew gently into his closed hands then opened them onto a small, country scene illuminated by the soft, silver light of the moon.</p>\r\n<p>"Night!" </p>\r\n<p>Fascinated, the goblins leaned in closer. Duman blew across the scene and the moon flared into the brilliant radiance of sunlight. </p>\r\n<p>"Day!" </p>\r\n<p>Gasps of pain filled the room as the goblins jumped back.</p>\r\n<p>"Hurt-light,” cried Teklok rubbing his eyes. "Father take day... give goblin night."</p>\r\n<p>Duman closed his hands and tapped his long nails together as he gazed around the muttering group. This was something that had not occurred to him. Still, at least he could be sure that they would return to the safety of the tunnels each morning! </p>\r\n<p>"Follow my instructions and you need not be exposed to the ''hurt-light'' and later I will bring something that will help you with this. Now then...&nbsp;as I said, you will begin in small groups but as you gain experience in the outside world more shall join you. Is everything clear and understood?" </p>\r\n<p>"Yes, Greatness," Ishtak replied for them all. "Fear, terror, no survivors, tunnels before hurt-light. When you desire we begin?"</p>\r\n<p>"As soon as Ishkat has named her successor to command the females. Don''t look so downcast," he laid a hand on her shoulder. "I''ve other plans for you and Ishtak...&nbsp;something much more important. So, who shall it be?"</p>\r\n<p>"Sempok,” she answered without hesitation. </p>\r\n<p>The males laughed loudly when they heard the name. Ishkat rounded on them furiously.</p>\r\n<p>"What you know?" she asked, lifting her shirt to reveal a scar running across four of her ribs. "Many male try. All die. Sempok do what they cannot. Sempok wound Ishkat." She turned back to face Duman. "Sempok best, skilled, loyal, respected, others follow like me." </p>\r\n<p>"So be it,” nodded Duman. "Bellak, see to it that Sempok is raised to the rank of general and takes command of the females."</p>\r\n<p>"At once, Great Father," replied Bellak, already hurrying out of the door. The rest followed more slowly after they were dismissed, hoping to hear what Duman had planned for Ishtak and Ishkat. But Duman merely sat with his hands in his lap and his eyes closed until there was just the three of them left in the room. He picked up the sack and threw it to Ishtak. </p>\r\n<p>"These are for you. Share them or not, as you will," he shrugged. </p>\r\n<p>Ishtak climbed to his feet and delved into the sack with childish curiosity. The first object was made from animal ribs, laid against each and welded with magic, to make a shield that was solid as a rock yet light as a feather and which covered him from neck to knee. Slipping his arm into the strap he walked a few steps then, with an unimpressed grunt, offered it to Ishkat who shook her head. Laying it aside, he delved into the sack again. This time a broad smile lined his face as he gazed at the skull helmet in his hand. It was a perfect fit and he loved the feel of the long, orange hair of the previous owner that hung in a bloodied tangle down to his waist, swishing along his back as he shook his head. He handed the sack to Ishkat.</p>\r\n<p>To his mates'' delight the last item was weapon. A heavy, thighbone handle had been shaved into a lethal point at the bottom and fused onto a pelvic bone that had been shaped and sharpened into a double-headed axe. One edge ran plain; the other was serrated with fine teeth. Her expert eye told her it looked good... but was it good? Bones were brittle, most likely it would shatter the first time she used it. Taking a wide swing, she brought the axe down upon the floor. The stone cracked. Swinging the axe-head back up she was amazed to find the edge undamaged, not a single one of the fine teeth broken. She ran her thumb across the blade. It was still razor sharp. Beaming with pleasure, she stuck her thumb into her mouth, sucking noisily. Suddenly the light faded from her eyes. Though she desperately wanted to keep the gift she knew she must offer it back to Ishtak. He had not known that the sack contained such a mighty weapon when he had handed it to her. He was male and her mate; it was his right to have first option. Arms heavy with disappointment, she held the axe for him to take. A slow grin spread across his face as he placed his hands upon it. Ishkat lowered her eyes. To her surprise she felt it being pushed back against her chest. </p>\r\n<p>"Keep," he told her. "You fight better fight. Earned it." </p>\r\n<p>Duman watched in amusement as Ishkat grabbed her mate and hugged him fiercely. Ishtak was quite obviously bemused by this un-goblinish show of affection however, it seemed that he was in no hurry to disentangle himself and Duman was compelled to make a noise in his throat to remind them of his presence. Red-faced and scowling, Ishtak made a show of pushing his mate aside and retrieved the shield.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to the earlier orderliness, the tunnels were now a hive of activity. Armed males walked to and fro. Some alone, some accompanied by their mates to whom they were giving instructions and warnings to be observed during their absence. Other, non-mated goblins, male and female alike, hurried past loaded with bundles and sacks of provisions to be taken to those working at the head of the tunnels. Children scooted between the busy bodies, ducking beneath blows and restraining hands, following those making their way to the exits for as long as they could before they were caught and sent back. If they were then there was no dodging the raining blows of their mothers but they were too full of excitement to take any notice of the pain and as soon as they were released, were off to do it all over again! But no matter who they were or what they were doing, all stopped respectfully and made room for Duman to pass unhindered. </p>\r\n<p>Rounding a bend, Duman saw Bellak leaving the Council Chamber. Behind him, looking very self-conscious in her new attire came Sempok. Seeing her, Duman understood the reaction her name had caused earlier and the renewed laughter coming from inside the chamber. Even by goblin standards, short and muscular this female most certainly was not. Her short steps bespoke a severe lack of confidence, as did her downcast eyes, and the cross belts and weapons that caused Ishkat to strike such a commanding figure, simply made her appear ridiculous. Duman began to have severe doubts about this choice of leadership and muttered such under his breath. With an angry growl and a raking sneer of contempt for the sniggering males behind the new general, Ishkat stepped in front of Sempok and barred her way.</p>\r\n<p>"What males know?" Duman heard Ishkat whisper to her. "You better than this." She thrust a fist under Sempok’s chin and forced her head up. "Better than them. They jealous. Outrank most all now. You ignore. I show scar Sempok give. Name you second me only. You prove me wrong?"</p>\r\n<p>The change that came over Sempok was nothing short of amazing. Determination filled her eyes, straightened her back and threw back her shoulders, so that she suddenly seemed a head taller. Angry pride hardened the self-consciousness in her face and she spun on her tormentors with a deep-throated, threatening snarl, knives flicking into her hands with invisible speed. The sniggering faltered and died as, white-faced and shaken, all except Bellak dropped their eyes. Ishkat threw back her head and laughed, shouting insults after them as they slid away. She slapped Sempok on the back. Sempok grinned back at her, then remembering in whose presence she was, she turned to Duman.</p>\r\n<p>"Great Father. Sempok thank for great honour. Make proud. Spill much blood. Kill many enemies. Eat many hearts. Die if must." </p>\r\n<p>"Ishkat has assured me of your prowess. If you''re as good as she says then I doubt the latter will be necessary," replied Duman. </p>\r\n<p>Sempok nodded, first to Duman, then to Ishtak and Ishkat and then she was strutting arrogantly through the crowded tunnel with even Bellak hurrying in her wake. </p>\r\n<p>Duman strode off in the opposite direction and soon reached the entrance cavern, circled the pool and ducked under the overhang onto the final pathway back to the fortress. The two goblins were enraptured at the sight of the rock face dissolving then solidifying again before their eyes. Ishtak stretched out his fist, punching its solidness. </p>\r\n<p>"Magic,” laughed Duman, wiggling his fingers while Ishtak licked his bleeding knuckles. </p>\r\n<p>Hobbling along behind Duman with the re-opened wound on his thigh dripping fresh blood down his leg, Ishtak looked up in dismay at the daunting staircase rising high into the central tower. </p>\r\n<p>"Take my hands, both of you," Duman reached out. "Look at me... don''t look down."</p>\r\n<p>Of course, this was the first thing the goblins did and clutched fearfully at his robe as the floor beneath their feet fell away. Higher and higher they rose until, much to their relief, Duman stepped forward and they once again felt solid stone beneath them. Duman opened the nearest door and Ishkat, churning stomach forgotten, rushed inside and pulled a chair over to the high window, eager for her first sight of the outside world. Ishtak followed her, holding tightly onto her belt as she climbed onto the back of the chair and leaned out as far as she could &mdash; determined to see everything there was. Bleak, dismal and uninviting, the misused land of Hur stretched way in a grey barrenness that was broken only by the occasional clumps of swamp grass clinging persistently to life amidst pools of popping mud. Gaseous vapours drifted in lazy, rolling aimlessness across their surface, as though rising upwards was simply too much effort. And over all this hung the heavy, brooding cloud that shrouded the land in the dull, dreary monotones of permanent night. Ishkat sighed deeply, wishing she could be down there, to touch and taste everything. Ishtak grumbled his protests as she tried to lean out further.</p>\r\n<p>"Beautiful... is it not?" </p>\r\n<p>Startled by the suddenness of Duman’s voice in the quiet room (for both goblins were so engaged in their own occupations they had quite forgotten he was there) Ishkat fell headfirst out the window. Still holding her belt Ishtak necessarily followed. Luckily for them both, the window was narrow and by splaying his legs, Ishtak managed to halt their untimely descent with his feet while Duman reached out to haul them in. As soon as they were on their feet, Ishtak’s huge fist cracked Ishkat squarely on the chin. She staggered back but did not fall.</p>\r\n<p>"Told you... see well enough from here," he slammed the chair on the floor then picked it up and threw it at her.</p>\r\n<p>"Next time listen. General maybe fight Ishtak," he warned as she took a step forward, fists clenched and teeth bared, "but mate better stand... take beating like proper female!" </p>\r\n<p>Ishkat glared at him silently while a bright, purple lump swelled rapidly on her chin. Ishtak glared back, hand slipping to the knife in his belt as he dared her to retaliate. Duman wondered what might have happened if had not been here, for surely Ishkat’s eyes were full of rebellion. But after a last growl (like females everywhere she was going to have the last word!) she retrieved the chair and climbed back on it. With a studied deliberation that was quite blatantly meant as an insult, she turned her back upon her mate. Anger doused by pride for the fearless manner in which she continually dared to stand up to him, Ishtak shrugged and climbing up beside her, laid his arm across her shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"What called? Land that bubbles?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Bogs," answered Duman. "Soon there will be a huge army camped there. And you two... " He paused turning their heads to face him, "you shall lead it against our enemies."</p>\r\n<p>Two spiky-toothed grins drooled with excitement.</p>\r\n<p>"But before you can do that, you''ll have to gain their acceptance of your leadership. In this I can''t, and won''t, aid you. You have to prove your worth to me... as well as to them."</p>\r\n<p>"Kill enough... they learn," replied Ishkat eagerly.</p>\r\n<p>"They won''t be easy opponents," cautioned Duman. "The main body and highest ranking creatures of the army will be these...&nbsp;Gracht. Large, powerful, vicious fighters and merciless killers." He pulled an image of a tall, muscular, reptilian creature from his palm. Heavily armoured about most of its body with overlapping scales and with snapping jaws of scissor teeth, it appeared invincible. Only when it turned and exposed a fleshy area around its groin was any weakness revealed. As far as the goblins were concerned, it was enough.</p>\r\n<p>"We kill," they agreed bluntly with the bored arrogance of the superbly skilled. </p>\r\n<p>Duman gazed thoughtfully from one to the other. Their confidence was pleasing. As it should be after their earlier performance, he told himself, but whether that skill was a match for the Gracht remained to be seen. Telling them to get some rest and that he would send someone to see to their needs, he swung towards the door.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the tower room, Duman lowered himself onto the couch. He closed his eyes and activated the connection spell with the Sectii. His vision opened onto a dark sky overcast by clouds, thick and heavy with imminent rain. Beneath him, with their glorious autumn garb of red and gold muted in the dreary, shadowed light, dense forests gave way to rolling hills and grassy meadows interspersed with the orderly signs of habitation. The criss-cross boxing of ditches and hedgerows, that kept in the grazing livestock and demarcated the fields of crops, resembled a huge patchwork quilt thrown over the bed of the Earth. Some of those working and playing on this living quilt looked up as the Sectii passed overhead. Many simply returned to their tasks but a few, perhaps more sensitive than the rest, shivered and made for the nearest cover. Duman was unconcerned by either and turned the Sectus'' attention back to where waterways threaded through the greens and browns of the landscape, winding veins of silver and black depending on whether the sun managed to find a gap in the clouds to peek through. He followed these, trying to ascertain his location but it was difficult since one human settlement looked very much like another to him and none seemed anywhere near large enough to be one of the major towns or cities. It was possible that the collection of dwellings just beginning to appear on the edge of his vision was the town of Eihaven but it was too far away to be sure. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly the ground surged toward him as the Sectus fought against a violent gust of down-wind from the brewing storm. About him he could see the others in this group beating their winds furiously as they struggled to stay aloft. They were tired, having flown relentlessly since leaving the fortress. If it was Eihaven ahead then they had covered many leagues and in view of the worsening weather, Duman decided he could afford to allow them time to rest and eat. One by one, he commanded them to land but ordered their flight resumed come sunrise or after the storm had passed... whichever occurred first. Any longer and they would find themselves rooted permanently for there would be no Kretos on hand to dig them out. He remained with them while they descended into a small grove with a shallow stream winding through the trees and on up past the side of an isolated track. It was ideal feeding ground. They settled along the waters'' edge or dispersed among the trees. Motionless, they blended into the natural fauna and waited for their victims.</p>\r\n<p>Severing final contact, Duman lifted his eyelids onto the cold, colourless walls of the tower room. For the most part he was pleased with the outcome of the days'' events. The Sectii were almost in position, the Goblin wave of terror on Rohansuk was imminent and by the time the army arrived, Ishtak and Ishkat should be fully healed. Before long the Kings'' forces would be satisfyingly scattered throughout the land, running around like headless chickens trying to calm and protect the panicking population. Only two things rested unpleasantly on his mind. Exactly what it was that the girl had done to create such a deep imbalance on the astral plane and the presence of the group at the place called Willoway. </p>\r\n<p>He knew dwelling on the latter was quite irrational since he had no plans for the place, now or in the future, but for some reason it bothered him like an incessant itch and he decided to scratch it now before it spread. He hurried back to the Summoning Room and called forth the Watchers in the vicinity of Willoway. There were only two. That of the man named Sylo and his wife. He instructed the Watchers to mark the useful from the useless in the village and the latter, along with the village itself, was to be laid to waste when reinforcements arrived. Task accomplished, he expected to feel better... he did not. He was tense and aggravated. A little light amusement followed by a relaxing sleep was in order, he decided and strode off to the lower regions to select a suitable playmate.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as the wizard’s consciousness faded from the physical world, the Orb swirled with kaleidoscopic essence as the brothers came together.</p>\r\n<p>"I hath important news from Yushok,” the inner surface of the Orb flared crimson.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell us quickly. He doth sleep but lightly and ''tis not safe for us to be here," cautioned Tareb.</p>\r\n<p>"The Lady Alyse hath taken to herself an Order of Knights. She hath marked them with the sign of the Dragon and sent them abroad to prepare for war." </p>\r\n<p>There was a great whirling of colour as the brothers communed in unison.</p>\r\n<p>"Be calm!" Tareb suffused the Orb with pastel blue.</p>\r\n<p>"Doth he know of this?" wondered Baroth.</p>\r\n<p>"Wouldst he tell us if he did?" The sarcastic retort came, unsurprisingly from Felnath. "To what purpose doth Yushok reveal this? It doth seem to me that ''tis of little value to us." </p>\r\n<p>"Think brother,” replied Tareb. "The child must indeed be growing stronger to bestow the Dragonmark. And by taking the offensive in this manner, she mayest force his hand before he is ready. So mistakes art made. Both art to our advantage."</p>\r\n<p>Unconvinced, moss green throbbed with non-committal. The soft azure of Tareb, deepened to indigo for a moment, as if the Dragon sighed deeply.</p>\r\n<p>"Whence goeth she now, Soleb?" </p>\r\n<p>"Tis still the Ladys'' intent that her brother be taken to Phelise, out of harms'' way." </p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps ''tis as well. I... " </p>\r\n<p>"Hush! Canst thou feel it? That which watches?" </p>\r\n<p>"Yes. ''Tis same as before." </p>\r\n<p>"No, ''tis altered somehow. There is more about it now. ''Tis not of him, I certain of that now," confirmed Soleb. Orange confusion dusted scarlet essence. "Yet ''tis not of the Races either." </p>\r\n<p>Multi-coloured shades of surprise and puzzlement swirled in agitation.</p>\r\n<p>"Then what?" </p>\r\n<p>"Whatever it be, ''twill hath to wait." Tareb broke up the union. "He doth arise." </p>\r\n<p>In the far corner of the room, two pairs of black eyes watched the Orb clear before closing.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 21, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(25, 'The blind lead', 'CHAPTER THIRTEEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="L" src="L.gif">eaving Willoway behind, Cymon, Alyse and Jarok galloped along the main roadway until they spotted the great oak Eiva had described in her directions. They cut across country to where it grew near the dried-up bed of a diverted river, which they followed as far as the five large stones set in a broken line across its width and from where, Eiva said, they should be able to see the ''Old man of Skopal''. Cymon scanned the rising ground, growing increasingly anxious as the light continued to fade. If they did not spot it soon they would be stuck here in the open till morning. <p></p>\r\n<p>“Over there,” cried Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>“I don''t see it,” Cymon shook his head, trying unsuccessfully, to follow Jarok’s pointing finger.</p>\r\n<p>“See where the grass line ends... there''s a ledge that juts out? Now look slightly to the right and up a bit. That big boulder, that''s him. An old, bow-backed man sitting cross legged on the ground.”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon located the boulder easily enough but despite squinting and turning his head this way and that, he really could see nothing more than a boulder. He shrugged, it obviously needed a child’s'' imagination.</p>\r\n<p>“Can you see it?” he asked Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\r\n<p>“Well, I can''t see a thing,” he admitted in defeat, “But it''s two to one for the boulder, so let''s go.”</p>\r\n<p>As they began to climb, Royle jumped out of Alyse’s hold and when they finally arrived at the place where the ''Old Man'' sat, led them to an opening hidden behind the rocks. It was dim and narrow, the walls leaning inwards as they rose allowing little of what daylight was left to penetrate. They led the horses through in single file, hooves clattering hollowly in the echoing passage, and it was with thanks that they emerged into the silence of a plateau. Everything was just as Eiva had described it. Away to their left, a body of water bubbled up from some underground source... too small to be called a lake, yet too large for a pond... with a narrow channel leading off, taking water to a large pump standing in the yard of a solitary cottage nestling beneath a deep overhang. To one side of the cottage were two barns and a small outbuilding. Between the barns, a paddock was fenced off and in it was a herd of goats and two plough horses. As they approached, a pair of geese rushed at them from inside the outbuilding, honking furiously and flapping outstretched wings. Light spilled from the door of the cottage.</p>\r\n<p>“Who''s there?” shouted a man of middle years, stepping out of the doorway armed with a large broadsword pointing in their direction.</p>\r\n<p>“Friends,” Cymon shouted back.</p>\r\n<p>“Step down...&nbsp;and keep your hands clear of your weapons!”</p>\r\n<p>Cymon gave Alyse an uncertain glance. This was not the man that Eiva had described to them.</p>\r\n<p>“He is quite naturally wary but a good man at heart,” Alyse assured Cymon silently.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon nodded and dismounted and keeping his hands held well out away from his sides, he strode forward.</p>\r\n<p>“Eiva sent us... Eiva of Willoway,” said Cymon. </p>\r\n<p>“Don''t know any Eiva,” answered the man.</p>\r\n<p>“Redeye,” Jarok called out from his place behind Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>With a loud guffaw, the man lowered his sword and held out his hand in greeting.</p>\r\n<p>“I haven''t heard that for many a year,” he laughed. “Come in and welcome. It''s alright Lara, they''re friends of Eiva.”</p>\r\n<p>A young woman appeared and took Alyse and Jarok into the cottage while Ador, (so the man introduced himself), helped Cymon with the horses. Afterwards, over supper, Ador explained that the man Eiva had spoken of had been his father who had passed on just over a year ago. His mother had been gone about five years and Ador’s wife had died in childbirth when Lara was born.</p>\r\n<p>"Eiva will be sorry to hear of it. She spoke very highly of your parents."</p>\r\n<p>"I keep meaning to go down and see her but there''s always so much to do. I hadn''t realised it had been so long. I''ll have to make some time and go."</p>\r\n<p>"I wish you would," answered Alyse. "Eiva is in great danger, as indeed I believe, is the whole village. We tried to persuade her to leave but she would have none of it."</p>\r\n<p>"That doesn''t surprise me. When her husband was killed my father tried desperately to get her to come and stay with us. Week after week he persevered but eventually he had to admit defeat... and my father wasn''t one to give up easily. What''s this danger you speak of?"</p>\r\n<p>Alyse told him of Duman and the threat of war and of the consequences of Eiva having given them aid and of their need to cross the Ridge, quickly and quietly. Ador admitted honestly that had it not been for Eiva’s support of them and the corroboration of Cymon’s identity, he would have dismissed them as crackpots and sent them on their way. As it was, he promised to escort them as far as the camp of a band of mountain gypsies at Largon Falls, who would, he was sure, take them the rest of the way. Then he would go straight down and sort out Eiva, he promised. They talked until supper was over and then retired. Ador had the horses ready and waiting just as the leading rays of the rising sun peeked over the rim of the plateau and Lara supplied a breakfast of biscuits and cheese for them to eat along the way.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll be back before sunset," Ador told her kissing her on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"Stop fussing, father. I''ll be fine. Say hello to everyone for me and ask them when they''re coming in. Safe journey,” she waved after them as they rode off.</p>\r\n<p>The jagged trail upon which Ador led them rose sharply off the plateau in, what seemed to be, a systematic series of dead ends and obstructing landfalls that could easily confuse or trap the unwary. Or the unwanted, Cymon thought to himself as Ador, obviously well versed in the whereabouts of the accessible gaps and barely discernable detours, traversed it confidently.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re quite correct, my friend," replied Ador when Cymon remarked on his observations. "In my distant grandfathers'' day, the plateau was a well secreted hideaway for those who needed to disappear for a while... mostly highwaymen, thieves and the like.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the obstacles are, as you guessed, man made and the subsequent safe route they created was known only to a select few. It still is."</p>\r\n<p>"What did he do, that grandfather...&nbsp;to have to come to the plateau I mean?" As always, Jarok never let the chance to ask a question pass unused. Alyse was about to scold him for his impoliteness but Ador said he did not mind at all.</p>\r\n<p>"He was a poacher by trade and stumbled upon the plateau by pure chance. He realised its potential immediately and, after bringing the family there, staked claim to it. Then he spread the word amongst a certain element of the population, that he would provide a place of sanctuary. For a fair price, of course! There was no shortage of takers." </p>\r\n<p>"Did nobody ever tell?" Not being the best at keeping secrets, Jarok was amazed that the plateau could remain hidden with so many people knowing about it.</p>\r\n<p>"Never and for two reasons. Firstly, strange as it may seem, there was a code of honour amongst these people and once they''d sworn the oath of secrecy, none would dare break it. Secondly, if they told where would they go next time?"</p>\r\n<p>"But why would he want to help them? They were bad people... weren''t they?" asked Jarok, as his encounter with the three villains earlier in their journey sprang to mind.</p>\r\n<p>"Not all. True, there are some people who are just naturally evil but there are others who perhaps do bad things but it doesn''t make them bad people. </p>\r\n<p>''Never judge until you''ve been there. Not everyone is as fortunate as you are'', he used to tell his children and they theirs," Ador slipped a reproachful glance towards Alyse, whose face had tightened with disapproval during his tale. "For many, especially in those days, it was often the only way to survive. Grandfather knew the difference between greed and necessity and always made the distinction between the two. Most of the money he made went to the less fortunate, so that they wouldn''t have to keep turning to a life of crime to provide for their families."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok had always been taught that wrong was wrong and right was right but now it seemed there was a grey area in between. He fell silent to think it over. Ador stopped and dismounted, telling them they would have to walk from here. The trail narrowed to no more than a slit in the rock that veered off at a sharp right angle into a cave too low to ride through. </p>\r\n<p>"Be careful inside the cave," Ador warned them. "It dips sharply near the back, then takes a steep rise back up to the exit behind the waterfall. Stay close and tread carefully. The ledge is wet and slippery and it''s a long drop. Keep the horses to the outside and if they panic...&nbsp;let them go. Sounds cruel I know, but better them than you,” he squeezed Jarok’s shoulder as the boy gasped in shocked disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>When Ador said the cave was low, he meant it; their heads almost scraped the ceiling. There was a strong, musky odour and a carpet of chewed bones and animal faeces littering the floor. Ador led them through, apparently undisturbed by the possibility that the occupier might return. Cymon began to suspect the whole scene had been set up to deter the unwanted from wandering any deeper. Towards the rear, as Ador had warned them, the ground dropped sharply into a small dip where the passage made a ''U'' bend and then rose in a sharp incline. At the top, the group found themselves behind the roaring waterfall that drowned all other sound. Ador motioned them to stick to the wall before leading his horse slowly and carefully along the slippery ledge. Alyse followed behind him, then Jarok and finally Cymon, bringing up the rear. The ledge ended in a thick curtain of tumbling vine-weed that Ador lifted aside until everyone was safely through. When Cymon looked back the opening was completely concealed, giving no indication that this vine was any different to the rest that clung tenaciously onto the rock face. Only from the inside was the netting that supported it visible. Cymon nodded to himself... it was masterfully done. Voices claimed his attention and he turned his eyes to the brightly painted caravans set up, somewhat precariously he thought, on the green slopes ahead and the crowd of shouting children running out to meet them. They obviously knew Ador well, for they all greeted him by name and with beaming smiles. He threw a bag of sweet biscuits to the eldest, to be shared amongst them all in return for taking care of the horses. Jarok stood uncertainly as they called him to join them.</p>\r\n<p>"Go... play," urged Ador. "It''s quite safe...&nbsp;they never bite till after nightfall!" </p>\r\n<p>Jarok looked up at Alyse, even more uncertain than he had been before.</p>\r\n<p>"Ador is only teasing. Go and play," she gave him a gentle push. Jarok ran off, held between the hands of two of the gypsy children. Royle raced along behind as far as the nearest camp dog, whereupon he jumped onto the roof of one of caravans to keep watch in safety.</p>\r\n<p>"Ador,” a tall, slim young man, with warm, brown eyes and gold rings in his ears, hailed them as he wended his way between the gambolling children. "You''re looking well. How''s Lara?"</p>\r\n<p>"Fine," replied Ador. "Looking forward to seeing you again. Will you be coming through soon?"</p>\r\n<p>"Soon as everyone else arrives," the young man answered.</p>\r\n<p>"Good. Then maybe she''ll be able to talk about something else for a while and give my ears a rest,” he grinned and slapped the pink-faced, young man heartily on the back. His face sobered. "Is Gwym about, Tielan? I need to speak to him about something."</p>\r\n<p>"He''s waiting for you in the Sharran’s caravan," Tielan nodded, gazing at Alyse and Cymon with open curiosity before adding, "has been for some days."</p>\r\n<p>"A vision?" Ador asked in surprise. </p>\r\n<p>"Not for me to say," replied Tielan, smiling to show he meant no offence. </p>\r\n<p>"So, when are you going to ask Lara and be done with it," Ador changes the subject and quizzed Tielan, as he led them down the slope to the Sharran’s caravan.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s still young. I want to give her the chance to meet others first, so she can be sure of her feelings."</p>\r\n<p>"My boy, Lara has been sure since you rescued her from the water-pool and carried her back home," laughed Ador.</p>\r\n<p>"But she couldn''t have been more than eight years old then,” argued Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>"And a skilled swimmer who was in no danger of drowning. Trust me boy," Ador laid a fatherly arm around Tielan’s shoulders, "when a woman sets her mind to something... or someone... age makes no difference. I saw the look in her eyes as you carried her in and I thought to myself then, ''there goes a doomed man''!"</p>\r\n<p>"But I spent the whole of that summer teaching her how to swim!" Tielan almost wailed. "And all the time she... was reeling you in like a fish," finished Ador, enjoying himself immensely. "Welcome to the family, son!"</p>\r\n<p>"I thought I recognised that laugh," interrupted a new voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Gwym!" Ador jumped the steps of the caravan and pumped the gypsy’s'' hand warmly.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s good to see you too, my friend," replied Gwym, who could have been Tielan’s twin if it were not for the greying temples and the lines of age about his face. His welcoming smile faded as he nodded to Alyse and Cymon. "Come on inside. The Sharran is waiting."</p>\r\n<p>The warmth of the caravan was welcoming after the growing chill outside. A thick rug lay on the floor, patterned in leaves of autumn colours, and a heavy curtain draped the closed door behind them to keep out draughts. A table, set with four glasses and a bottle of wine, stood in one corner with four chairs next to a dresser full of knick-knacks. A small cot and brazier were set opposite the dresser.</p>\r\n<p>"Come closer and warm yourselves."</p>\r\n<p>The invitation... or order... it was hard to tell which, came from the wizened, old woman of indeterminate years who lay propped up on pillows upon the cot. Hair white as snow, though still maintaining the thickness of youth, was braided and coiled like a crown about her head and held in place by a beautiful, ebony comb carved into a bird. Gold loops hung from her ears and about her neck she wore a golden torque, twisted from fine strands of silver and set with a single, oval shaped emerald into which was embedded a thin sliver of jet. As Alyse and Cymon moved closer the lamplight, reflecting on the milky-white opaqueness of her eyes, revealed that the old woman was totally blind. </p>\r\n<p>"Let me look at you." </p>\r\n<p>A thin, almost skeletal hand lifted from beneath the blankets as each knelt in turn to allow slender fingers, gnarled but agile, to trace the contours of their faces.</p>\r\n<p>"Ador,” the old face wrinkled even more as she smiled. "At last we meet. I knew your Grandfather well. It saddened me when I learnt of his passing...&nbsp;and your Father too, I''ve been told."</p>\r\n<p>"Both always spoke most highly of you Sharran and of your people. Grandfather especially so."</p>\r\n<p>"He was a rare man... tones of wistful sadness softened the dry voice, and your father like him... as are you, who follow in their footsteps of friendship and generosity," she patted his cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m honoured that you regard me as such, Sharran," replied Ador, taking the hand and placing a light kiss upon the wrist.</p>\r\n<p>"A flatterers'' tongue and manners to match. We shall make a gypsy of you yet,” she laughed delightedly. "Now, let me see your companions."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon hesitated, knowing his cloak might fool the eye... but not the hand. </p>\r\n<p>"You may remove it," she startled him by saying, as though reading his thoughts. "We know what you are...&nbsp;Elfin!"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon looked up at Gwym’s sharp intake of breath to find, not surprise, but an inexplicable expression of overwhelming despair on the gypsy’s'' face. He looked like a man drowning and just for a moment, the expressive brown eyes pleading with Cymon to throw him a lifeline. Cymon could only stare in puzzlement. The eyes hardened and Gwym turned his head away sharply and moved toward the door. </p>\r\n<p>"Stand!" The Sharran’s command rang through the room.&nbsp;"You cannot run from what must be."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym stopped. He laid his hand against the door and leaned heavily on it for a moment, then straightened his shoulders and returned to his place on the other side of the cot.</p>\r\n<p>''What was all that about? Any idea?'' Cymon asked Alyse silently.</p>\r\n<p>''The Sharran’s gift shields all knowledge imparted by her.'' Alyse replied vaguely. </p>\r\n<p>But it is... ''</p>\r\n<p>"Now then, Elfin," the Sharran’s voice cut off whatever Alyse had been about to tell him. "Hmm?" she mused. "I don''t know much about Elfin standards," her tone was alive with mischief, "but I''d wager you set a few hearts fluttering. Mine too, I shouldn''t wonder, if these old eyes could catch a glimpse."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon laughed, surprised but delighted by her flirting. </p>\r\n<p>"L''lanyi tuath allièn''ne sol''ai," He kissed her wrists. "All are but shadows beside the light of your beauty," he whispered, placing two fingers upon her forehead. </p>\r\n<p>"Ahh,” she heaved a sigh of regret. "Were I young again, I fear I should be lost."</p>\r\n<p>"Then we should be lost together." </p>\r\n<p>"Elfin,” she grinned. "You are worse than gypsies,” she rapped his knuckles sharply. Her head lifted and her eyes locked with uncanny precision upon Alyse’s. "Come child and save me from this one," she waved her forward. Unlike Ador and Cymon, questing fingers searched Alyse’s face in sombre silence, pausing a while on her closed eyelids. Then she nodded to Gwym and leaned back wearily into her pillows. Gwym beckoned the bemused trio outside.</p>\r\n<p>"My Grandmother has dreamt of this meeting many times, though not the when," he told them. "As a consequence, she''s barely slept these last few weeks. Now you''re here she can rest. It''s her wish however to speak with you as soon as she wakes. Will you eat with us, Ador?"</p>\r\n<p>"With all respect, I''d prefer to get back to Lara."</p>\r\n<p>"That''s what I thought you''d say." He went over to the adjacent caravan and tapped on the window. "Eona! Bring the pack for Ador, and food for our guests." </p>\r\n<p>Eona appeared in the doorway and held out the pack for Ador to take. A child of about twelve years of age but already showing signs of blossoming into a great beauty, like her father and brother, she had brown eyes but hers were flecked with green and yellow highlights that glinted in the sunlight and finished with impossibly long lashes. A lock of jet-black hair blew across her face and the gold bracelets on her wrist jingled up her arm as she lifted one hand to tuck it back behind gold-looped ears to join the rest that curled in loose waves down to her waist. She too wore a torque about her neck, a garnet-studded silver circlet that depicted her to be the next in line to the Sharran. Alyse offered the girl a friendly smile but Eona turned away and disappeared back inside. Alyse turned back to Ador who was saying his goodbyes while he waited for the child Gwym had sent for his horse to get back. She hugged, thanked him for his help and wished him a safe journey back. </p>\r\n<p>"First thing in the morning," said Ador, reading the unspoken reminder about Eiva in her eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," she hugged him again.</p>\r\n<p>Ador swung the reins over his horses'' head and mounted. He tied the sack to the pommel and nudged the horse forward.</p>\r\n<p>"Ador,” Gwym suddenly called out, running after the trotting horse. "Tell Lara... "</p>\r\n<p>"Yes?" asked Ador, puzzled as Gwym faltered awkwardly.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell her I said hello and wish her well."</p>\r\n<p>"Of course,” laughed Ador.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was just declining a second glass of wine when there was a knock at the door and Malinka, the Sharran’s companion, informed them the Sharran desired their company.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you... for your patience towards an old woman," said the Sharran, as they entered her caravan behind Malinka. "I trust you''ve been properly cared for?"</p>\r\n<p>"Very much so. Thank you," answered Cymon, sitting next to Alyse in one of the chairs that had been set beside the cot. The Sharran nodded, then wasting no more time came straight to the point. </p>\r\n<p>"The first vision came many months ago. It was an Elf, whose spirit was black as pitch, standing in a tall tower surrounded by the glowing marks of evil. In his right hand he held a crystal sphere. In his left... a piece of amber, large as a hens'' egg. He raised both hands in triumph and the ground trembled. I know the old stories even though I cannot read. I knew who it was...&nbsp;and I despaired...&nbsp;for night after night the Dark Elf gloated of his victory until another vision came, once more of Elfinkind. Young and pure of heart, I saw an Elf. On one side a mighty Dragon, on the other a child. Fire consumed the two and when the flames parted, there was only one. The child smiled at the Elf and the Dragon rose and towering over him cried out: We are the Powerwielder! Many times this vision brought me hope. A third vision descended and I beheld Death. Standing upon the shores of Rohansuk she cast forth her net, day after day, and great was her catch. The icy chill of Death flowed from beneath her black robes, across the land over the slopes of False Ridge. Drawing back her cowl, Death revealed her face to me. She offered me a gift... and I took it," </p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="Death" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Death" src="Death01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>She paused, overcome by emotion. Malinka appeared and held a glass to her lips. She sipped slowly then waved Malinka away. </p>\r\n<p>"In my hand was a scroll, stained red with the blood of innocence. She beckoned me to open it:</p>\r\n<p>''Powerwielder! Tarry not in Phelise. Seek ye the Crystal Tomb and those whom sorcery hath bound there. In that place lift thine hand... and with tears... break the spell that doth bind them.'' "</p>\r\n<p>As she finished speaking, the Sharran fell back onto the pillows, her face pale and drawn, her breathing ragged. Again, Malinka was there in an instant. Cymon felt Alyse’s touch in his mind.</p>\r\n<p>''What do you think?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Most we already know about... Duman... you... the probable war ahead. The last? Maybe she''s forgotten something?''</p>\r\n<p>''That is unlikely. Her recounting of it is clear and decisive. Still, I too find it strange that there is intent but no direction. The Crystal Tomb will be impossible to find without instruction.” </p>\r\n<p>Alyse sighed as she pushed back her hair, gazing thoughtfully out of the window at the caravan opposite where Eona sat solemnly on the steps, staring into the distance. </p>\r\n<p>"The dark days foretold are upon us," said the Sharran, breaking Alyse’s muse. "My people are yours to command, Powerwielder."</p>\r\n<p>"Dark days indeed," agreed Alyse. "But the commanding of your people is best left in the hands of those who know their strengths and skills. Gwym is far better suited than I."</p>\r\n<p>"It shall be as your appointing," affirmed the Sharran. "And you, Powerwielder... shall you still go to Phelise?"</p>\r\n<p>"We must, for I have promised Elfin aid to the other Races and so must speak with the Elders. But I shall heed the advice of your vision, Old Mother and stay no longer than I have to."</p>\r\n<p>"Then I bid you a safe and speedy journey. Gwym, see that the Powerwielder and Cymon have everything they need and send Tielan to guide them as far as the Great Plain."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym made no move, only stared darkly at her through hooded eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"The Sharran has spoken,” the old woman snapped sharply.</p>\r\n<p>"As you command, my Sharran," he bowed stiffly then beckoned them to follow him outside.</p>\r\n<p>Recognising Jarok’s voice amongst the sounds of squealing children coming from behind the caravans to their right, Alyse and Cymon made their way there and found him busily engaged in an archery lesson being given by Tielan. They came up behind the gathering just as Jarok was pulling back the string. The arrow sped towards the target. There was a cheer as the arrow ''thunked'' home into the outer edge.</p>\r\n<p>"I did it,” cried Jarok, jumping up and down in delight.</p>\r\n<p>"Very good," said Tielan, drawing another arrow. "But this time, don''t jerk your string hand. Sight along the arrow and just let it slip gently through your fingers."</p>\r\n<p>Face screwed up with concentration, Jarok followed Tielan’s instructions.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s the way," Tielan continued his encouragement. "Firm but not tight. Back as far as she will go... sight... and release."</p>\r\n<p>This time the cheer was even louder and Jarok was mobbed by the watching children as second attempt found centre target. </p>\r\n<p>Tielan retrieved him from the mass of tangled arms and rolling around on the ground and set him on his feet facing his audience.</p>\r\n<p>"Did you see? I hit the middle!"</p>\r\n<p>"We did. It was a good mark, well done," nodded Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"He''s a natural bowman," smiled Tielan. "With your permission Alyse, I''d like to make him a gift of the bow."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok eyes widened with delight and he gazed pleadingly at Alyse, that she might say ''Yes''. Alyse felt a firm pressure in her mind, as she was about to refuse. Beside her, Cymon gave an imperceptible shake of his head at her decision. </p>\r\n<p>''You have to let him grow up Alyse. Especially in view of what lies ahead.'' </p>\r\n<p>''I know. I just do not want to,'' she replied honestly but she nodded to Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>"It is most generous. Thank you. However, you must remember it is a weapon, not a toy and be careful with it Jarok," she could not stop herself from warning, though she did manage to keep the distaste for such a gift from her tone.</p>\r\n<p>"I will," Jarok promised absently, already immersed in showing it off to the other children.</p>\r\n<p>"Mikal will take over. I need to speak with you Tielan."</p>\r\n<p>"Of course, Father." Tielan handed Mikal the quiver of arrows.</p>\r\n<p>Once they were out of earshot of the children, Gwym told Tielan of the Sharran’s command.</p>\r\n<p>"It really isn''t necessary for Tielan to travel so far," said Cymon. "We''ll be fine once we''re through the pass. I''m sure Tielan has far more important things to do. Ador was telling us how anxious Lara is to see him again," he winked at Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>"The Sharran’s word is law," Gwym retorted curtly. </p>\r\n<p>Tielan frowned at Gwym’s uncharacteristic shortness. He had never known him to behave in such an unfriendly fashion to welcomed guests. He smiled at Cymon to make up for it.</p>\r\n<p>"My father''s right. Great-grandmother can be a real tyrant sometimes," he laughed. "When would you like to leave?"</p>\r\n<p>"First thing in the morning?" </p>\r\n<p>"I''ll wake you at dawn."</p>\r\n<p>"Then we had best get supper and to bed," advised Alyse, walking off to find Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>The weather it seemed was not inclined to agree with their plans. It was raining heavily the next morning and for two days it continued in a steady downpour, which Tielan told them would make the crossing too dangerous to attempt. They had no choice but to remain in camp. Jarok was quite happy with this news and the chance to spend more time with his new friends. Royle was less than happy, mewling grumbles every time nature necessitated a trip outside, and returning as quickly as possible to the stove in the caravan that had kindly been vacated for their use. Cymon went out regularly to check the horses, which were (he told the cat) no less miserable but not in any position to do anything about it. Royle glared at him through narrowed eyes and curled himself into a tighter ball but with conscience pricked, made future ventures without complaint. Alyse spent most of her time cooking and pondering upon the Sharran’s visions, or more precisely, the lack of them. She had this constant feeling that somehow the information they had been given was incomplete and found her eyes constantly straying to Eona’s caravan.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s there again," remarked Jarok, as he sat rubbing pine oil into his bow on the second evening of their enforced delay.</p>\r\n<p>"Who is?" answered Alyse absently as she prepared supper.</p>\r\n<p>"Eona. Alyse, have I done something to upset her?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course not!" Alyse wiped her hands down her apron and went to join him at the window, kissing the top of his head as she sat beside him. "What makes you say that?" </p>\r\n<p>"I keep waving to her but she just ignores me." </p>\r\n<p>Alyse peered through the window at Eona, standing in rain and staring straight back at her. She waved but Eona took no notice. </p>\r\n<p>''Cymon? Where are you?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Just on my back, why?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Eona is standing outside her caravan. How close do you think you can get without her hearing you?'' </p>\r\n<p>''How close do you want me?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Right in front of her.'' </p>\r\n<p>''I can be quiet as a mouse but I''m not invisible Alyse!'' </p>\r\n<p>''Just do it Cymon,'' the thought came with a sharp stab of irritation.</p>\r\n<p>''Fine.'' he sent back with a wave of pain, then followed it with amazement. ''She'' blind!''&nbsp;He waved to Alyse at the window then in Eona’s face. ''How did you know?'' </p>\r\n<p>''Go and ask Gwym to come over. And Cymon, don''t tell him.''</p>\r\n<p>Gwym was not happy to see Cymon and even less happy to be dragged out in the rain without a reason. He stood just inside the door with his arms folded and a dark scowl to make his feelings quite clear. </p>\r\n<p>"If you''re going to ask me to order Tielan to take you across, forget it. I wouldn''t let a dog try it in this weather. It would be suicide and the Sharran wants you to get there in one piece." </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s eyes widened slightly at his tone. Quite clearly he did not care how many pieces they arrived in. She took a deep breath to control her rising temper.</p>\r\n<p>"Forgive me for disturbing you," she smiled sweetly, "but I wondered if the Sharran had received any more visions?"</p>\r\n<p>"If she had, she would''ve sent for you," Gwym told her curtly. </p>\r\n<p>"I was certain she must have for I sense an incompleteness in what she has told me."</p>\r\n<p>"The Sharran cannot choose what she will see. Now if... " he started to turn.</p>\r\n<p>"Such is the way of visions," agreed Alyse, nodding sagely. "It has always puzzled me, that all seers seem to be blind. Why is that?" </p>\r\n<p>''Excuse me?'' exclaimed Cymon silently. To his knowledge she had never met one until now. </p>\r\n<p>''I have not. Ecos has. Now be quiet, listen and follow my lead.'' </p>\r\n<p>''Yes, my Lady!'' </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s eyes flashed and he quickly stilled his thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>"A seer loses her sight of this world, in order to gain clarity in the other," Gwym was explaining, unaware of their exchange. "At least, that''s how Grandmother puts it."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse appeared to think this over before replying.</p>\r\n<p>"Now I understand," she said. "And what happens to the old Sharran... when a new one comes along? For I have noticed too, there is never more than one. Please forgive me," she added quickly, as Gwym’s eyes narrowed. "I did not mean to be impertinent. I am interested to learn more about your people."</p>\r\n<p>"When the ''Sight'' has passed on...&nbsp;so too, does the old Sharran." </p>\r\n<p>"That must be a terrible burden on the new Sharran. Knowing they are responsible for another’s'' death...&nbsp;so to speak." Cymon dutifully repeated the words Alyse gave him.</p>\r\n<p>"I hadn''t really thought about it before but yes, I suppose it must be."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse allowed him a moment’s pause to ponder on this observation before hitting him with her next question.</p>\r\n<p>"How long has Eona been blind?"</p>\r\n<p>"Eona isn''t blind!" His burst of laughter quickly turned to anger as he tried to deny the truth of it in her face. "I''m her father, you think I wouldn''t notice something like that?" he rasped.</p>\r\n<p>"She is very clever at hiding it. Please, sit down," she said as he swayed alarmingly.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t want to sit down,” he snapped.</p>\r\n<p>"As you wish," she sighed. "If Eona has not always been blind there must be a reason for it and logic dictates it is because she is having visions."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym’s mouth dropped open in astonishment and now he did sit, flopping into the nearest chair and hanging his shaking head in his hands.</p>\r\n<p>"No, it''s impossible. My grandmother... "</p>\r\n<p>"... Does not know either," Alyse finished for him, filled with remorse at the sight of his hunched figure. She had honestly thought that he knew. How else could Eona have managed to avoid detection if not with his help? Her estimation of Eona increased tenfold. To hide her blindness, not only from the tribe but from her closest family as well was indeed a feat of great courage and skill, especially when one of them was the Sharran! Gwym on the other hand, had no room in his head for thoughts of any kind relating to his daughters'' character just at that moment. He looked up, white faced and bewildered, at these three strangers who were turning his life upside down.</p>\r\n<p>"Believe me when I tell you... I understand exactly how you feel," Alyse told him.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m glad someone does... because I don''t," answered Gwym helplessly, "not any of it."</p>\r\n<p>"I did not tell you this to hurt you, or to betray Eona. Her secret is safe with us." </p>\r\n<p>"She no longer has a secret," he sighed wearily. "Tradition decrees the existing Sharran be told immediately the next in line is ''Sighted''. Eona knows this. She should not have hidden it." </p>\r\n<p>"Tradition is a powerful thing. And like all things of power, can be either good or bad," Alyse reached out for his hand as he rose to leave. "You see here a girl, with little or no knowledge of the world. But inside this frame dwells a being far older and wiser than you could imagine. All that he knows, I know. This is fact, for he was there. In ancient times, many of your people were gifted with the ''Far-seeing'', as they called it then. Over time, the numbers diminished until only a few were so gifted. By coincidence, some reached their allotted time just as another came to ''See'', and in this way your ''Tradition'' was born. Many spirits returned to the Mother long in advance of the years given them because ''Tradition'' dictated it was time to go and so they willed themselves to die."</p>\r\n<p>"You mean Grandmother will die just because she thinks she must?"</p>\r\n<p>"Unless this is her allotted time... Yes. The will to die can be as strong as the will to live, given the right motivation."</p>\r\n<p>"You could tell her... explain... as you have to me." His hope faded even before she shook her head. His Grandmother was too old to break from centuries of Tradition, even at the word of the Powerwielder. He was having trouble believing it himself! His body sagged, his mind cast adrift on a sea of doubt and confusion. He could either betray his daughter and cause his Grandmother’s death, or he could&nbsp;go against everything he had been taught and defy Tradition. He closed his eyes, almost choking on the anguish that swamped him. Alyse placed her hand gently on his knee.</p>\r\n<p>"Now, you understand Eona’s torment," she said quietly. "Believe me Gwym, I would have spared you this if I had any other choice. But Fate has decreed what must be and our destiny requires direction. If the Sharran has not received the vision we need it is because Eona has. It is vital to our quest that we know it. The Sharran could demand she reveal it to us but in light of the situation, that is a course I do not wish to pursue. However, I can request her fathers'' permission to speak with Eona and if, in the cause of that conversation, she should let slip what she knows... " </p>\r\n<p>For the first time since they arrived, Gwym smiled at them &mdash; a sad, sorrowful smile but genuine, for all its pain. </p>\r\n<p>"Would that I could hate you... but I can''t. In my heart I know that none of this rests on you and you would change it if you could." His chin began to tremble and he closed his eyes and sat silently for a moment. Then he got up and left.</p>\r\n<p>That Eona came with reluctance was blatantly obvious from the heavy, dragging steps with which she entered the caravan and the taut, unfriendly expression on her face. Gwym gave Alyse a shake of the head to let her know he told Eona nothing of their conversation.</p>\r\n<p>"Please, come and sit down Eona," Alyse’s voice was warm and inviting as she patted the chair beside her so that Eona might locate her position. Alyse could feel her trembling and squeezed the wringing hands reassuringly. She wanted to make it as easy as she could on the girl but could find no way other than head on. </p>\r\n<p>"Your father has agreed to allow me to talk to you about your vision."</p>\r\n<p>Eona stiffened and tried to pull away but Alyse tightened her grip. </p>\r\n<p>"Only the Sharran receives visions," Eona muttered into her chest.</p>\r\n<p>"I know you are blind," Alyse told her. </p>\r\n<p>Eona laughingly denied any problem with her sight.</p>\r\n<p>"Then tell me... how many fingers am I holding up?"</p>\r\n<p>Eona jumped to her feet, knocking the chair over behind her. </p>\r\n<p>"I will not be questioned by you,” she cried, drawing herself up proudly. "I am second only to the Sharran. You have no right!"</p>\r\n<p>"Second only. Until you are first, you are still my daughter," Gwym retorted sharply, setting the chair on its feet pressing her into it. "You will answer the Powerwielder...&nbsp;now,” Gwym ordered.</p>\r\n<p>Eona’s lips tightened and her eyes narrowed. She opened her mouth then closed it again. She shrank down into herself and began sobbing. Alyse put her arm about her and drew her close.</p>\r\n<p>“Cymon, perhaps you could get Eona a little wine, just to warm her through the shock?” </p>\r\n<p>Cymon brought a small glass and Alyse put Eona’s hands around it. Eona sniffed at it, then pushed it away. </p>\r\n<p>"Just a few sips. It will help calm you down. We understand and sympathize with the enormity of your burden. We have no intention of disclosing your secret to the Sharran," Alyse assured her as she drank the wine. "All we want is that you should tell us of your vision."</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t," sniffed Eona, pressing her lips tightly together. </p>\r\n<p>“Can''t you just take it from her?” Asked Cymon silently.</p>\r\n<p>“I have no access into her mind.” </p>\r\n<p>“You did it with Sylo,” he reminded.</p>\r\n<p>“No, I merely skirted around the edges of that which possessed him. It was not being quiet.”</p>\r\n<p>“And with me?”</p>\r\n<p>“I tore an opening,” she admitted. “I could have killed you... or worse... but you would have been lost had I not tried. I thought you would prefer to take the risk.” </p>\r\n<p>Cymon stifled his shocked gasp. </p>\r\n<p>“I should have stopped to ask?” The question arrived with flashes of memory. </p>\r\n<p>“Maybe not!” he conceded. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse turned her attention back to the problem in hand and her eyes to Gwym. </p>\r\n<p>"Listen to me, daughter." Gwym knelt down in front of Eona, his voice as gentle as the hands that cupped her face. "So far you''ve been lucky that only Alyse and Cymon have discovered your secret... but how long can you keep it up? Before long, someone else will begin to suspect and they may not keep silent." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Alyse has explained certain things to me and, well, maybe it''s time for change, but not yet, Grandmother is too old.&nbsp;Still, Alyse needs to know. Tell her your vision and I''ll help you to keep your secret until Grandmother passes of natural causes."</p>\r\n<p>"You would do this?" Eona gasped in amazement. "Go against all Tribal Law and Tradition? Go against the Sharran?"</p>\r\n<p>"If you had asked me that question yesterday, or even this morning, I would have said ''No''," he answered her honestly. "But now I see with a clearer perception," he quirked a grin at Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"But if anyone finds out that you''ve aided me in my crime? It would mean exile!"</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a risk I''m prepared to take to keep you both."</p>\r\n<p>"I won''t let you do it!"</p>\r\n<p>"I am your father. You can''t stop me... unless of course you become Sharran, but to do that you will have to tell your vision and then it will be too late."</p>\r\n<p>"In other words I have no choice in the matter?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course you have a choice," Gwym squeezed her hands gently. "You can either tell Alyse and let me help you or I can tell the Sharran and she will make you. I would rather do it my way. I love you both and don''t want to lose either of you. But there are bad times ahead Eona, and I doubt this will be the hardest decision you will face in them."</p>\r\n<p>Eona buried her head in his chest and he stroked her hair gently. Gwym sought Alyse’s eyes, silently asking her to wait until Eona was ready before proceeding. Alyse’s nodded. She felt the weight of Eona’s burden keenly, that now she was responsible for the fate of two of her loved ones, and from that empathy her own hatred (aside from that inherited from Ecos) of Duman was born, frightening in its intensity. She gazed from Eona to Jarok and back again. </p>\r\n<p>Children! </p>\r\n<p>They were just children! </p>\r\n<p>Somehow, she would make Duman pay for all the pain he was causing. Jarok slipped onto her lap and wrapped her arms around him protectively. He leaned up and kissed her cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"The Sharran’s word is Law... isn''t it?" he asked her.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, dear but I don''t see... "</p>\r\n<p>"Well then. Eona may not be ''The'' Sharran," he voiced his thoughts before she could finish, "but once she''s told her vision she''ll be ''A'''' Sharran. If she commands Gwym to keep silent, he would have to obey, wouldn''t he? So if anyone did work out Eona’s secret, he couldn''t be found guilty of anything."</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok,” exclaimed Alyse, kissing the top of his head. "When did you get so clever?" She turned to Gwym. "It may be stretching a point of Law... as it stands now... but I believe Jarok is right." </p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure? Father won''t get into trouble?" Eona asked anxiously, filled with doubt. </p>\r\n<p>"Gwym cannot be faulted for obeying the word of a Sharran," Alyse affirmed, with slightly more confidence than she was actually feeling. The reasoning was sound but an angry mob was rarely reasonable. She could only hope these two would never have to test the theory. Her own guilt grew as she saw the release of months of guilt and tension in Eona’s face and watched her whisper in Gwym’s ear. Gwym got to feet and moved to stand behind Eona’s chair.</p>\r\n<p>"My daughter, Eona, has consented to reveal her vision," he announced.</p>\r\n<p>"We are honoured by her kindness," answered Alyse with equal formality, inclining her head respectfully.</p>\r\n<p>Eona reached up for Gwym’s hand, resting on her shoulder. She closed her eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"Four nights ago a Lady came and took me to a high mountain. She blew softly and through the parting clouds I saw the Powerwielder and the Elf galloping on two white horses. They came to a river of white water, running swift and powerful, its churning depths barring their path. From the swirling foam rose a woman with eyes as cold as ice. Upon her head was a crown of polished silver; a circlet, plain at the back and rising to a peak in front; engraved with the likeness of a bear and studded all around with precious stones. She pointed to where another stood one far, far older than herself... older even than the Draconian. Swathed in gold with flaming hair, she was too beautiful to behold. She beckoned the Powerwielder and the Elf to follow her along the riverbank. She gave them a silver disc upon which was carved the name of the Ancient Heroes, the key to the Crystal Tomb. Then she bid them farewell and departed. I saw the two step forward, hand in hand... and then the Lady took mine and led me off the mountain." Eona bowed her head, breathing quietly. When she lifted it, opaque, milky-white eyes locked with uncanny directness onto Alyse’s. "Is it what you were hoping to hear, Powerwielder?" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>"I was hoping for something a little clearer," Alyse grinned ruefully before conceding, "But yes, it is the directions to the Crystal Tomb, as I expected."</p>\r\n<p>"A little clearer?" grumbled Cymon. "Ancient Huri would be easier to decipher!"</p>\r\n<p>"My Great-grandmother has taught me that visions, whilst often appearing vague and confusing are usually quite obvious once one has found the key."</p>\r\n<p>"And what might be the key to this one?"</p>\r\n<p>"My part is done," Eona grinned, with entirely too much satisfaction Cymon thought. "To find the key... that... is your task, Elf. And now if you will excuse me," she rose with a confident grace that drew the eye, commanded respect and had everyone rising with her. The Eona that had entered earlier that evening was gone forever. "I must return before Great-grandmother wakes." </p>\r\n<p>"Our gratitude for honouring us with this audience...&nbsp;Sharran," Alyse inclined her head, kissing the wrist of the hand Eona held out to her. "Your vision may yet make the difference between success or failure in the coming conflict." </p>\r\n<p>"Let us hope it is success, Powerwielder," replied Eona then turned and went through the door that Gwym opened for her.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 21, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

Tielan had dropped by just after sunrise to ask if they wanted to resume their journey that day and they told him they would. Royle was not so keen on the idea and mewling in disgust at the chill draught blowing in through the open doorway, he curled closer to the warmth of the stove. Cymon went over and picked him up, closing the caravan door firmly behind him before depositing him on the frost covered steps.<p></p>\r\n<p>"Sorry, Sir Cat but luxury is out for a while. Time to go."</p>\r\n<p>Royle spit at him and bounded off down the steps and over to the waiting horses. Some of the gipsies had generously donated saddle and bridle for the two roans and one thoughtful individual, probably at the insistence of one of the children, had even tied a basket onto the pommel of one for the cat. Knowing a good thing when he saw it, Royle leaped onto the roans'' back, totally ignoring its half-buck objections, and dropped down into the baskets'' fleecy lining.</p>\r\n<p>"You are going to get fat and lazy," scolded Alyse as she mounted. </p>\r\n<p>Royle lifted his head and gave her a lazy stare before flicking his tail over his nose and purring with snug contentment as Gwym joined them to bring the Sharran’s blessing. He embraced his son and bid them all goodbye. His voice was strained and gruff, then turned abruptly and strode off. Tielan frowned after him, wondering at his strange mood these past few days. It just was not like his father to be so unsociable. He hoped Gwym would snap out of before he got back. He wanted to talk to him about Lara. He kicked his heels and they moved off, tagged by children calling out for Jarok to ''come back soon''. </p>\r\n<p>"I wish we could''ve stayed longer," said Jarok wistfully, waving goodbye until they turned and went back to camp. "If I wasn''t a warrior... I think I''d like to be a gipsy."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure the Sharran would adopt you, if you asked her." said Tielan. Jarok’s eyes lit up for a moment but then he shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>"That would be nice but Alyse says I have to go Phelise."</p>\r\n<p>"I could always kidnap you and force you to stay. That''s what gipsies do best you know... steal little children when no-one is looking." Tielan screwed his face into a menacing scowl.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s not true,” laughed Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"I know... but you''d be surprised how many people think it is," he answered.</p>\r\n<p>"They must be the same silly people Ador knows," observed Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"More than likely," agreed Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>The two of them entertained each other in this manner all that day, and well into the following morning, as they continued to climb higher onto the Ridge. The further they went the colder it became and they gradually fell silent before the icy wind that swept across the open mountainside and bit deeply into their bodies and froze the previous days'' rains into glass beneath their feet. Alyse, warmed by the Power within her, felt nothing of the severity of the conditions but the others rode huddled under their cloaks, white breath hanging in the air before them. They spent a miserable night, huddled together with only a boulder at their backs to shelter them from the whistling wind. But after a while the shared heat from their bodies filtered through and they began to doze. Cymon protested silently to Alyse as the night progressed; he alone aware of where most of that heat was coming from and how much it was sapping her strength to give it. She promised she would rest on the morrow. </p>\r\n<p>Whether she would have kept her promise was doubtful, as Jarok’s lips began to turn blue with the cold, but they came upon the cave Tielan had been heading for and the subsequent fire made her intervention unnecessary. There were a number of such emergency caves dotted about the Ridge, which the gipsies kept well supplied, Tielan informed them.</p>\r\n<p>"We wouldn''t usually use them at this time of year but then we''re seasoned travellers on these paths and are used to the hardships. But there are times when someone''s forced to travel late and find themselves in need of shelter. When the snowfalls up here it usually comes down in a blizzard and this is no place to go stumbling around on when you can barely see your hand in front of your face. Actually, the idea was Ador’s grandfather. When we began regular wintering on the plateau, he encouraged us to set up this network. We didn''t really see the need then, but we''ve had many a reason to thank him for it since. Accidents happen: injured horses, broken wheels. These caves have saved many a life until help arrived."</p>\r\n<p>"What about when everything''s been used?" asked Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s customary to check the caves as one passes and give a little to replenish anything that has been used or spoiled," explained Tielan. Jarok’s hand rummaged about in his pouch.</p>\r\n<p>"Will it be all right if I leave this?" he asked Alyse, and then held it out to Tielan when she nodded her approval. "It''s fathers'' spare tinderbox. I noticed Cymon had to use his own to start the fire. What if the next person hasn''t got one? I''d like to leave it, if I may?"</p>\r\n<p>"That''s very generous Jarok, but surely... if it was your fathers you’d want to keep it?" Tielan hesitated. </p>\r\n<p>"I''ve got other things to remind me of father." </p>\r\n<p>"If you''re sure?" Tielan checked again, thanking Jarok when he said he was. "Then it will be most welcome." He put it in a niche above the stack of kindling.</p>\r\n<p>They ate and rested for a while, chatting amiably around the cheering fire before, warm and replete, they stepped once more into the wind-swept chill of the exposed trail. As they struggled up an exceptionally steep incline, littered with loose rocks and shale, Tielan began to cast a worried eye to the upper slopes. Cymon joined him as he dismounted and the two of them disappeared around the bend ahead. </p>\r\n<p>''What is wrong?'' Alyse voice echoed in Cymon’s mind.</p>\r\n<p>''Landslide.''</p>\r\n<p>''How bad?''</p>\r\n<p>''Tielan is checking now.''</p>\r\n<p>"What d''you think?" he asked aloud to Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>"Not good but I think we can get passed. The difficult part will be getting the horses over. They may panic with all the loose ground under hoof," he replied scuffing the ground with his toe.</p>\r\n<p>"Is there another pass we can take?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes... but it''ll mean going back the way we came for some distance. Add that to it being a longer route anyway and you could be looking at another three... maybe four days. Longer with bad weather," he answered.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ll cross," said Cymon firmly. </p>\r\n<p>They returned to Alyse, gave her the details and unsaddled the horses.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll take mine first," said Tielan. "He''s used to coping with these sort of conditions and it might calm the others if they see him cross safely."</p>\r\n<p>Tielan’s horse picked its way carefully but calmly over the fallen rocks. When they reached the other side, Tielan beckoned Cymon to follow. Defiant snorted as Cymon reached for his bridle, disgruntled that the elf should even think he needed assistance. Whispering in his ear to be careful, Cymon let Defiant find his own way over. Safely across, Defiant gazed back and tossed his head, whinnying encouragement to the two roans standing white-eyed and trembling, at the sight of the rocks and rubble ahead and the sheer drop to their sides. They were having none of it and backed off, stomping their front hooves and snorting loud refusal. Alyse whispered soothingly as she rubbed between their eyes, moving her hands upwards to linger on their foreheads. She blew gently into their flaring nostrils until they stopped quivering and relaxed.</p>\r\n<p>"I have given them an image of safe, green pasture," she told Cymon. "Take them quickly... it will not last long."</p>\r\n<p>Once the horses, Alyse and Jarok were all safe, Cymon and Tielan made several more trips carrying the saddles and packs. Cymon was on his final crossing when ominous rumbles echoed from overhead. He looked up in surprise and saw the side of the mountain collapsing down on top of him.</p>\r\n<p>"RUN,” three voices shouted simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>The first edge of stones and dirt was already breaking over him and he knew he would never make it. He glanced down. To his right was a small gap in the rocks and, praying to the Mother it was neither too small nor too deep, he made a dive for it. Landing with a thud, he immediately doubted his decision as the space about him began to fill with loose debris. He tucked his head protectively beneath his arms under the rain of stones. The earth shook as the mountain thundered down. Then there was only darkness and the muted roaring of the sliding earth beyond the large rock that now sealed his hiding place. Soon he could hear nothing at all. </p>\r\n<p>“Perhaps I should''ve run for it after all,” he thought self-deprecatingly. </p>\r\n<p>"Ever wise after the fact," he mocked himself in the dark silence. </p>\r\n<p>He wriggled down into a more comfortable position and, closing his eyes, began conjuring up images of Phelise to keep calm. There was no point in panicking &mdash; all he could do was wait, either for the others to find a way to get him out... or to meet the Mother. He was wandering the banks of the S''ahen Ani when he felt the searching, anxious touch of Alyse in his mind.</p>\r\n<p>“Cymon? Are you hurt?”</p>\r\n<p>“Just a few cuts and bruises,” he told her. “ What''s it like on your side?”</p>\r\n<p>“Not too bad,” she answered, just a little too quickly. </p>\r\n<p>“You''re a terrible liar,” he replied, injecting a smile into his thoughts. “Don''t cry for me... and don''t deny it, I can feel it. Take Jarok and go. Defiant knows the way home and Tielan will look after you till you get there.”</p>\r\n<p>A sharp stab jarred his temple.</p>\r\n<p>“Stop talking nonsense and listen!” </p>\r\n<p>“Alyse... Ow! That hurts,” he objected when she delivered another.</p>\r\n<p>“It was supposed to,” she snapped. “Stop trying to be a hero and do as you are told. Place your hands on the rock so I can locate your position.”</p>\r\n<p>“Alyse, there''s no time for this. Duman... the weather... your promise to the Knights... Leave me here and go on.” </p>\r\n<p>“I cannot!” </p>\r\n<p>“You must! Once you''ve crossed the Great Plain the sentries will spot you and take you in.”</p>\r\n<p>“Even if I were strong enough to do as you ask, you forget the vision. We both must journey to the Crystal Tomb.” </p>\r\n<p>“Nice try... but Eona didn''t name me personally... just the Powerwielder and an elf. The Elders will choose another to accompany you.” </p>\r\n<p>“I do not desire another.” Pain stabbed his head again. “Just put your hands on the rocks, Cymon.”</p>\r\n<p>The space seemed smaller than before after her touch left him but he resisted the temptation to reach out to her again, knowing that she needed to concentrate. He kept his attention on the feel of the rock under his palms, certain that he could feel the brush of her hands across his. Whatever happened, she would come back. He continually encouraged himself with that thought when the air grew thick and stale. There was a faint draught near his feet and he shifted his position to bring his face, as close to it as he could but the little air it provided was not enough to replenish what he was using. He grew drowsy and disorientated and his mind drifted. It seemed an age that he sat, crouched and cramped, alone in the darkness. At one point he thought he heard voices along with the vibrations of the rock beneath his fingertips and then dark became darker as he slipped into unconsciousness.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse had not been entirely untruthful. His position was not so bad... at least, not as bad as it might have been. The moment she had seen him jump she had lifted her arms... palms thrust outwards with a pushing motion... and mentally leaned into the path of the falling debris. She knew she could not stop it but she hoped at least to divert it a little and protect the place where Cymon had disappeared. Tielan and Jarok watched with wonder, as the deluge of rock and mud appeared to rebound off thin air and bounce away down the far side of the pass. Even so, some of the finer dirt and stones found their way through and trickled down into the gap. When a large, flattish rock passed close, Alyse caught it in a mental grip intending to position it so that it would lay slightly askew, shielding the opening while allowing air in. But the boulder was heavy and she was already weak with her efforts and it slammed down, sealing the hole completely. She cried out her anguish, pushing Jarok forcefully aside when he ran to her. She had to keep as much of the slide off as possible, she screamed to herself. Sweat ran down her face, despite the increasing coldness of evening, as the weight of the avalanche pressing upon her drove her to her knees. Panting and crying with the effort... eyes paling from rich amber to an insipid yellow... she forced herself to maintain the invisible barrier until the fall subsided and she collapsed, exhausted onto the ground.</p>\r\n<p>"We canst do no more," a faint voice gasped to Jarok as he rushed to kneel at her side and cradle her burning head in his arms. "Mine Sisters'' power is stronger by far than mine alone, even in its entirety."</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t try and talk. Drink this." Tielan handed her a water skin. "It''s laced with herbs. The Sharran’s own recipe."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse sipped the cool liquid. It trickled soothingly down her throat then turned to fire in her belly. She sat up and drank some more, feeling her energy return.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know how you did it but most of the fall went in the other direction. Still, it''ll be near impossible to dig him out... even if he''s still alive," Tielan told her bluntly. Alyse jerked her head up and glared at him angrily. "I''m sorry, but you have to be realistic. It''s hardly likely that he survived," he pointed to the mass of earth and rock that had overcome her waning strength. Alyse clenched her teeth and forced herself to her feet. Tielan had to admire her determination, so even though he thought it a complete waste of time, he slipped his arm around her waist and helped her to the edge of the fall. Desperation and fear added to the lines of exhaustion already etched into her face, as she knelt and placed one hand on the earth, moving it in slow circles. He was about to make her come away when she heaved a gasp of relief and looked round at him through tears of joy.</p>\r\n<p>"He is alive,” she cried. "Through here," and began clawing at the dirt.</p>\r\n<p>Though disbelieving, Tielan took pity on her and thought he could at least make a show of trying to rescue the elf. Marking the place with his neck scarf, he picked her up and carried her back to a safe distance to rest then resumed her digging. Jarok appeared at his side and insisted on helping. It was a tricky (and necessarily slow) business. Once, as they rolled aside a medium-sized boulder together, the mound of mud it had been holding at bay slid down, almost sweeping Jarok away with it. Tielan grabbed his hand just in time to pull him to safety. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s getting too dangerous," he insisted, when Jarok protested at being sent back to sit with ALyse. "Cymon will have my hide if I let anything happen to you, not mentioning what Alyse might do to me."</p>\r\n<p>While Tielan dug, Alyse used what little strength she had left to take Cymon down into unconsciousness, slowing his heartbeat and his breathing and hoping to conserve the little air he had. As the digging went on she feared they would still not be in time. It was with great relief then, when she heard Tielan’s cry of dismay as he came to the solid rock of the boulder behind which Cymon lay. The gipsy avoided her gaze and she knew he must have thought her cry of joy quite mad. Right now she did not care, only Cymon mattered.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok, help me over."</p>\r\n<p>"You can''t. You''re too weak," argued Jarok, gazing at her white face and shaking limbs. He loved Cymon like a father but he would not help Alyse kill herself.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I will do it myself," she spat out and gave him such a look that he gasped and backed away, hiding his face in his drawn up knees. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s all right, Jarok. You go and make sure the horses are okay," Tielan gave the boy’s shoulder a quick rub as he passed. He carried her to the boulder. She knelt down and placed both hands upon it. Gritting her teeth she allowed the Power to seep through her fingertips. Gently at first keeping a close eye on the volatile debris about her as the boulder began to vibrate, she gradually increased the flow. Within the rock, the separate particles of its mass began to ground upon each other. Tielan’s mouth dropped open as the eroding rock filtered from beneath her palms like fine sand. He fell to his knees and began shovelling away the pile accumulating in front of her. As soon the last layer of rock fell away, Tielan lifted Alyse aside and wriggled his upper body into the hole.</p>\r\n<p>"I have him,” came his muffled shout as he began wriggling back out, grunting and heaving, dragging Cymon by the wrists. Pulling the elf clear, he carried him back to safety and laid him carefully on the ground then went back for Alyse who was trying to crawl after them. Alyse took Cymon’s head into her lap and wiped the dust and dirt from his face with the corner of her shirt, then lifted his head slightly while Tielan poured a little of the herbal wine into his mouth. Cymon coughed and spluttered, spitting out the dirt and dust that clogged his throat. He reached for the skin and took long gulps. His eyelids fluttered open and he smiled wanly at the three worried faces peering down at him.</p>\r\n<p>"If I hadn''t seen it I wouldn''t have believed it," Tielan shook his head in wonder, now that it was all over and beginning to sink in. "How d''you feel?" </p>\r\n<p>"Like a mountain fell on me," Cymon forced a hoarse croak over his sore throat. "Remind me never to do that again,” he joked, and then fell into another fit of coughing. Tielan poured some more wine into his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Lie still and I will heal your wounds," ordered Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll do no such thing,” he refused swiftly and winced at the dry pain that shot through his chest. "A few cuts and bruises won''t kill me. You''re worn out... I can see it in your eyes."</p>\r\n<p>"I am a little tired," she admitted.</p>\r\n<p>"She held back the whole mountain,” exclaimed Jarok. </p>\r\n<p>"Jarok, I am sorry about before," Alyse held out her hand, guilt-ridden as she recalled how she had treated him. Typically, Jarok took the blame on himself. </p>\r\n<p>"I should have trusted you," he hugged her and kissed her cheek. </p>\r\n<p>"She was incredible," agreed Tielan. "She wouldn''t give up on you."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m supposed to be looking after you," Cymon gazed up into the shimmering cornflower-blue eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"That was before," she smiled, blinking away the moisture that threatened to overflow. "Now we look after each other."</p>\r\n<p>"There''s a lesson in here for you, my lad." Cymon glanced at Jarok. "Number five... or is it six? Anyway... Always listen to good advice."</p>\r\n<p>"Now that, ” laughed Tielan, “is good advice!"</p>\r\n<p>Their shared laughter lifted their spirits a little more and they assured Tielan they were quite capable of riding. Still, he kept the pace slow and only took them as far as the next cave where they could rest in relative comfort and recover properly from their ordeal. Woozy and tired, Cymon fell asleep straight after supper... much to Jarok’s disappointment, since he was halfway through his recounting of the rescue at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse was not far behind, exhausted more than she revealed from the days efforts. After his third story, Tielan told Jarok that it was about time he too got some sleep. Awake alone in the quiet of the night, Tielan gazed at the sleeping group and wondered at their strangeness. </p>\r\n<p>"If such as these are here now, then what lies in the future?" he whispered quietly to himself. </p>\r\n<p>Usually possessed of a good imagination, he found it strange that when he tried to imagine what that future might hold he could see nothing but darkness and the image of his father’s face torn by grief. Finally he too, fell into a troubled sleep.</p>\r\n<p>The air outside was crisp and fresh. Tielan forecast snow before the day was out and consequently they skipped lunch, pressing onwards to cover the final ascent. The majority of the time they spent on foot, until they slid down into a gorge running parallel with the jagged backbone of the Ridge. From there they were able to go on horseback once more, following the rocky bed of the crystal-clear river that ran through it. Luckily it was still running low, allowing them to travel its shingle banks rather than wading through its flesh numbing coldness. Later, after the winter snow and spring melts, the entire gorge would become a raging torrent and be impassable until the summer, Tielan told them. Around mid-afternoon they came to an arched opening shaped by weather and time, the company followed Tielan through and stepped onto what Jarok later described as ''the top of the world''. Jarok was the first to dismount and rushed to the edge of the cliff, leaning forward to stare over the precipice. </p>\r\n<p>"Careful," warned Cymon, pulling him back a few steps. "Even Defiant couldn''t run fast enough to catch you before you hit the bottom!"</p>\r\n<p>"Isn''t it wonderful!" Jarok eyes vied with the sun for brilliance, as he spread his arms wide across the breathtaking panorama before them.</p>\r\n<p>"Glorious," agreed Cymon, taking a deep breath as they sat down together to enjoy the view.</p>\r\n<p>Silver-speckled blue thread wound its way through multi-hued green cloth embroidered with rich highlights of yellow, russet and brilliant orange. Dark splashes of brown and black added depth and texture to the pattern, alongside the rolling hills and dipping valleys that bobbed up and down like frozen waves on a green sea. Trees lifted their boughs to the heavens, stretching muted shadows on the ground beneath them. Jarok laughed at the animals and people, no bigger than the thumbnail he measured them against, as they moved about oblivious to his presence, comparing them to the ants he had watched on their nest so many times back home. He tried to imagine who they were, where they were going and what they might be doing. He leaned forward unconsciously, unable to fill his eyes full enough, breathing deeply of the cold mountain air and exhaling it in misty vapour that floated like a soft veil before him, softening the scene still further. He felt both exhilarated and insignificant at the same time. Captive of its beauty and yet filled with a wondrous sense of freedom of spirit, he wanted to stretch his arms and soar like a bird on the wind. To be wild and free, high above the Earth where the clouds billow and drift in lazy aimlessness. </p>\r\n<p>"I could sit here forever," he sighed dreamily, then straightened and mused in sombre tones. "Why would anyone want to destroy such beauty?" </p>\r\n<p>"The Sharran would say... ''If there''s no beauty within... how can one recognise the beauty without?''" said Tielan quietly.</p>\r\n<p>"I feel sorry for Duman, if he can gaze upon wonders like this and truly feel nothing," Jarok murmured sadly.</p>\r\n<p>"Do not waste your pity on Duman!" Alyse’s harsh voice grated behind him. "He chose his own path to darkness and he would have none for you."</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps not, but," began Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"But nothing," she snapped so curtly that he flinched. "Duman is dangerous. You cannot afford one drop of pity. If he sensed any such in you, he would not hesitate to use it and destroy you. We do not know what the future holds and even though you are taken safely to Phelise, there may come a time when you must protect yourself. Save your pity for those who deserve it." His hurt and shaken expression finally registered through her anger and her face softened. She leaned over and kissed his forehead. </p>\r\n<p>"You mean more to me than a thousand such scenes." Her voice caught in the back of her throat and she turned and walked away before any of them saw her tears. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok sagged forward, his elbows in his lap and his face in his hands, his enjoyment spoiled by the mixed emotions Alyse had raised in him. Tielan glanced quizzically at Cymon over the boys'' bent head. Cymon shrugged, he had no idea why she had been so hard on Jarok and doubted she would tell him if he asked. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m going to see to the horses," said Tielan getting to his feet, leaving Cymon to coax Jarok out of his melancholy. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon gazed about for some kind of inspiration. </p>\r\n<p>"Look over there," he said, nudging Jarok with his elbow. Jarok lifted his head reluctantly and politely turned his eyes to where the cloud-heavy skyline met the immense, purple wash splashed dominantly along the horizon. </p>\r\n<p>"That''s where we''re going. The Anatol Mountains. This Ridge is no more than foothills compared to them," Cymon told him proudly, his face alive with the eagerness of homecoming. Even from this distance the majestic presence of the Anatols towered over them, their lavender hue raising higher and higher before fading into lilac, snow-capped peaks that paled as they merged and disappeared into the clouds. Jarok gasped, awed by both the sight and by the thought that sprang immediately into his mind. He swallowed apprehensively.</p>\r\n<p>"Do we have to climb those too?"</p>\r\n<p>"Why, do you want to?"</p>\r\n<p>"Definitely not,” replied Jarok, quickly and firmly.</p>\r\n<p>"Me neither," Cymon winked, pulling Jarok to his feet when the boys'' easy laughter confirmed his mood had been restored. "Come on, we''d better give Tielan a hand." </p>\r\n<p>Even though there was still a certain amount of daylight left, they bowed to Tielan’s advice and spent the night there, sheltering beneath the archway. It was a cold camp, so to cheer Jarok the men swapped childhood memories to which he listened avidly, forgetting all about the cold rock under him and the whistling north wind that stung his cheeks. A certain amount of wistful longing crept into his face as they spoke of brothers and sisters and countless friends... his own life had been so solitary. But not unhappy... Alyse had made sure of that and he loved her for it. He would not swap one Alyse for a million siblings or friends. Unconsciously, his hand slipped into hers and soon he had drifted off to sleep. Alyse warmed him and then laid her blanket over his own to keep off the night chill. She asked Tielan for his hand. The gypsy raised an eyebrow at the strange request but he obliged, quickly jerking it back when he felt the heat move up his arm.</p>\r\n<p>"Do not be afraid, it will not harm you. It is my gift on a cold night. It is the least I can do for your help in saving Cymon."</p>\r\n<p>"She''ll have her way anyway, so you may as well give in and be done with it," grinned Cymon. Later, as the temperature dropped even further and the first flurries of snow thickened into a heavy fall, both were grateful for the warm fire that radiated through their bodies. </p>\r\n<p>Something woke Cymon from the blissful dream of summer in Phelise in which he, Alyse and Jarok were lazing by a burbling brook and throwing biscuit crumbs to a growing flock of white feathered birds filtering down from overhead. He opened his eyes. Tielan and Jarok were rolled in their blankets, deep in sleep. A turn of his head confirmed Alyse’s place was empty.</p>\r\n<p>''Alyse? Where are you?'' he reached out urgently.</p>\r\n<p>''Over here,'' the delicate echo floated softly in his mind, along with an image of her sitting near the cliff edge staring up into the night sky. </p>\r\n<p>"What are you doing out here?" he whispered, sitting beside her and throwing his blanket about them both.</p>\r\n<p>"Watching the snow fall. Did you know that each flake has a pattern all of its own &mdash; perfect and delicate? I never realised just how amazingly beautiful snow was until now. It is indeed one of the masterpieces of the Mother’s creations."</p>\r\n<p>"No, I didn''t know but I''ve always loved snow. Makes everything looks so fresh and new." He pointed to the ground far below. "Like a blank piece of paper waiting for someone to come and write on it."</p>\r\n<p>"What would you write?" she asked curiously. </p>\r\n<p>"That they all lived happily ever after," he replied without hesitation.</p>\r\n<p>"If only it were so simple," she sighed deeply, slipping her arm through his and leaning into his shoulder. They sat quietly, uncaring for the passing time, each thinking their own thoughts as they gazed upon the silent serenity of the snow covered world below. It was hard to remember, in the face of such peaceful beauty, the dark evil that threatened to overtake them. It stopped snowing and Cymon lifted his eyes to a clear sky sparkling with stars. He lay back, tucking his hands behind his head. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s been a long time since I did this," he murmured softly. </p>\r\n<p>"Think?" she grinned down at him, her eyes twinkling as brightly as the stars above.</p>\r\n<p>"No," he gave her a scolding look and pulled her back to lie beside him. "Stargazing. When I was child, my father would often take me up to Loi S''huñ. We would lay there all night just watching the sun go down and the stars twinkling in, one by one. He knew them all. See that cluster there?" He pointed to Alyse’s left, where a thick sprinkling of white stars lay across the midnight-blue surface of the sky resembling a woman in a long flowing dress, her hair billowing out behind her. "That''s Y''siel. Beside her is the constellation of Te''norèn... the black stallion that was the father of all equine. Legend says that Te''norèn was the first animal ever created... " </p>\r\n<p>Alyse knew all this through Ecos'' memories but she loved to hear Cymon’s voice, especially when it was soft with longing for home. She snuggled closer, content enough to purr as he stroked her hair while he talked. </p>\r\n<p>"His coat was blue-black, sleek and glossy, his mane, long and silky, hanging the full length of his arched neck. He carried his head high and proud, that all might see the hand of the Mother that blazed, brilliant white, upon his forehead. He was swifter than the wind. Sparks flew from his hooves as he galloped the virgin earth, sweeping tail streaming out behind like a banner. Speed, stamina, courage, perfection of shape and movement... Te''norèn had them all. Yet he wasn''t vain or conceited but gentle and placid, pure and honest of heart. Te''norèn sired many children... each as exquisitely formed, strong and brave as himself... but not one could ever match him for fleetness of foot. Nor, to her surprise (for She loved them all) did any touch the Mother as deeply as he. Such is often the way of first born... my father used to say. When Te''norèns'' span came to an end, the Mother cast his spirit into the heavens where she might behold him forever... galloping in graceful splendour as he keeps watch over his children. Elfin lore says; that as long as</p>\r\n<p>Te''norèn walks beside Y''siel, horses will continue to grace the Earth."</p>\r\n<p>"It is a beautiful story," Alyse breathed softly, still caught up in the mood of it.</p>\r\n<p>"None of it probably true though. Few myths and legends ever are," he gave a wistful sigh, lost in his wonderings so that he did not realise Alyse had sat up and was looking down at him with a mischievous glint in her eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Woulds''t thou knowest the truth, Elf?" The deep, archaic tones made Cymon jump and he sat up, clutching his thumping heart. Amber orbs swirled with amusement. "Thine love and reverence for the Mother, mine Sister, hath not gone unnoticed and doth please mine heart. I maketh this offer unto thee... for wert I not there? So, Elf... Shalt I tell thee whether thy legend is truth or no?"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s pause for thought could barely be called such. He shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m honoured, mighty Ecos, that you think me worthy of such a boon but I can''t accept it. The Mother’s secrets will be revealed to me when my time is come, until then they should remain hers'' and hers'' alone."</p>\r\n<p>"Again thou hast pleased mine heart. I shalt not forget." Amber orbs swirled brilliantly and then inner lids closed and dancing blue eyes laughed into his.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s really most disconcerting when you do that," Cymon complained, once she assured him the Dragon was gone. "Anyway, I thought you said you shouldn''t do that?"</p>\r\n<p>"He wished to talk to you," she shrugged. "A few moments will not hurt. You have made quite an impression on him. I think he wanted to test you," she laced her fingers through his and lifted his hand to her lips.</p>\r\n<p>"And what if I''d given the wrong answer and said yes?"</p>\r\n<p>"I knew you wouldn''t." She smiled smugly.</p>\r\n<p>"I might have. It was a very tempting offer," he said thoughtfully. "To know the truth of Creation."</p>\r\n<p>"What? And spoil a good story... not you! See, even Y''siel thinks so," she teased as the constellation of Y''siel suddenly flared brightly. Cymon laughed and pulled her close, nipping her ear. She wriggled, pretending to complain and then the stars winked out, plunging them into darkness. It was only for a heartbeat but it left Alyse white-faced and shaking.</p>\r\n<p>"I do not like this, Cymon," her voice trembled as she turned in is arms. "There is a great heaviness in my heart." </p>\r\n<p>Cymon cradled her like a baby, laying his cheek on the top of her head as he rocked her gently back and forth. The awesome beauty of the previously innocuous heavens was now spoilt by the mysterious presence of foreboding and he was glad for the renewed fall of cleansing snowflakes that obscured it from his sight. Next morning, Cymon told Tielan and Jarok about the strange portent. Alyse had not wanted to tell Jarok anything but Cymon had insisted, arguing that he would be safer warned than ignorant and besides, the boy was too discerning not to sense something was wrong. The decision to forgo breakfast and set off immediately while the weather remained clear was unanimous.</p>\r\n<p>Their descent proved quicker, if not easier than their climb up. It was definitely more painful as they slipped and slid through the soft snow down the steep slopes, the horses on their haunches and the rest of them on their backsides. Royle, naturally, could not pass up the opportunity to show off and ran on ahead, leaping nimbly from rock to rock, washing himself with an air of bored superiority as he waited for them to catch up. A day and a half of increasingly sore behinds and a growing impatience for the aggravating cat later, they all heaved a sigh of relief as the trail connected with the wider, winding track used by wagons and livestock. At this lower level there was as yet only a fine dusting of snow and they were able to push on at a good pace and at supper that evening, Tielan informed them that they were more than halfway down. Alyse made pretence of looking pleased by the news but inside she was extremely troubled. The further they descended toward the Great Plain, the greater her sense of foreboding grew and it was not helped when they ran, unexpectedly, into a gipsy family on their way to the Plateau.</p>\r\n<p>"Fenor! I''m surprised to see you here. We had word you weren''t coming this year."</p>\r\n<p>"Nor we were," answered the worried-looking driver of the caravan.</p>\r\n<p>"So what''s changed your mind? It must be something important for you to risk travelling this late. We''ve already had snow on the high top."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s Tenora. She," his voice cracked and he had to take a moment to steady it, "she''s come down with a strange illness &mdash; red with fever yet cold as ice to the touch. Our own healer has tried everything she knows but to no avail, so we''re taking her to the Sharran. She''s our only hope." He pushed trembling fingers through grey-flecked hair and stared back at the group, from eyes ringed black with lack of sleep, with such an air of hopelessness that Alyse did not wait to be asked before demanding to be taken to the sick child.</p>\r\n<p>"But you are Puchka! Why would you want to help a gipsy child?" Fenor asked suspiciously.</p>\r\n<p>"I care nothing for her race. She is the Mother’s child and I can heal her. What more is there to know?"</p>\r\n<p>"You know of this illness?"</p>\r\n<p>"I do not need to know," replied Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>While Fenor hesitated, Alyse was already climbing the steps to the door. Inside, Tenora laid tossing and turning upon the cot, her mother beside her changing the cooling cloth upon the child’s brow. The soft, soothing tones that filled the room, like the cloths, were having little effect on the child who moaned and flailed her arms. The woman turned up the light, when she realised the approaching footsteps did not belong to her husband, revealing a haggard, tear-streaked face and the same despairing gaze. </p>\r\n<p>"Fenor? What''s going on?" she demanded of her husband, hurrying in behind Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s alright Magra. She''s with Tielan," Fenor waved Tielan in. "She says she can heal Tenora."</p>\r\n<p>"What sort of sick joke is this," screamed Magra, already stretched beyond her tether. "A Puchka! And a child to boot! What can she know of healing that our own old and learned don''t? Get her out of here Fenor and let our child die in peace." Unable to sustain her anger in her grief, Magra fell sobbing into the chair beside her daughter.</p>\r\n<p>"Judge not by mine outward appearance, my daughter Magra. For I am older by far than any of thine. Trust me and she that we art. Thy daughter will soon be well." Alyse smiled and squeezed Magra’s hand, then seated herself on the edge of the cot. She placed her left hand on Tenora’s forehead and allowed her right to move over the child’s body, seeking the centre of her disorder. It finally came to rest on Tenora’s right ankle. Closing her eyes, she focused upon the wound beneath her palm. Tenora’s body began to glow, shimmering in the lamplight, while her flesh rippled in the wake of the Power passing through it. The glow intensified as first Tenora’s legs began to twitch, then her whole body was claimed in the throes of stiff, jerking spasms. Her eyelids flew open, showing the whites of her eyes as she screamed so violently, that Cymon and Jarok came rushing though the door. Magra cried out in alarm and jumped up, clawing at Alyse to drag her away from her child. Cymon reached her first, clamped her arms against her sides in a vice-like grip and pulling her away. </p>\r\n<p>"Let me go,” she shouted, struggling to free herself. "She''s killing her!"</p>\r\n<p>"Calm yourself,” he hissed into her ear. "If you interrupt her now, you risk harming them both. Your daughter could not be in better hands. Trust her."</p>\r\n<p>"He''s right Magra," Tielan whispered to terrified woman. "If you had seen what I''ve seen her do, you''d know it." </p>\r\n<p>Alyse blew gently across Tenora’s face. The child’s eyelids fluttered back down and her struggles grew weaker. She sagged into mattress, still and silent.</p>\r\n<p>"Tenora,” Magra screamed, her grief giving her the strength to wrench herself from Cymon’s grasp. </p>\r\n<p>"She is but sleeping," Alyse told her calmly as she rose from the cot to allow Magra to take her place. The fiery red of Tenora’s skin had faded to a healthy pink. Her breathing was soft and easy and her body completely relaxed in a natural, peaceful sleep. Magra stroked one, cool cheek in disbelief, she had been certain her child was dead. A raking sob escaped her as she gathered her daughter up into her arms. Eyes, overflowing with tears and grateful apology, said more than any words. Alyse rested an understanding hand on the woman’s shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"She will sleep now until the morrow and when she awakes will remember only that she has been unwell. What you saw was but the edge of her agony and I would not leave her suffer such memories," Alyse explained gently.</p>\r\n<p>"Can you tell us what was wrong with her?" asked Fenor, coming to stand beside Magra and holding her hand. </p>\r\n<p>"Tenora was bitten but it was not a natural toxin. Had we not chanced to meet," she paused uncertainly, scanning their faces and then continued honestly," then even the Sharran would have been unable to save her. Go to Gwym when you reach the camp, he will explain everything to you fully if you ask him. Until then I advise that you be extra vigilant, especially with Tenora. No more running around in bare feet! Things are happening in the world, bad things, and we must all keep alert."</p>\r\n<p>"Words aren''t enough for what you''ve done for us. Is there nothing we can do for you? Anything. Just ask and it''s yours," Fenor’s voice was thick with pent up emotion.</p>\r\n<p>"There is... " Alyse was about to say ''no need'', when Cymon’s voice whispered in her mind.</p>\r\n<p>''Gwym might need a little help in the near future,'' he suggested.</p>\r\n<p>"One thing," she continued instead, "that you will pledge yourself to stand beside Gwym in all matters."</p>\r\n<p>"I have yet to go against him, he''s a good and just man," Fenor was clearly puzzled, wondering what could have occurred for her to make such a strange request.</p>\r\n<p>"I think so," agreed Alyse. "Do we have your pledge then?"</p>\r\n<p>"Without hesitation if that''s your wish but is there nothing more we can give?" </p>\r\n<p>"That will be enough," Alyse shook her head and his hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Will you stay and eat with us?" Magra came out of the caravan to ask. "We would be honoured to share bread with you."</p>\r\n<p>"And we with you," Alyse returned her hug, "but unless the others are hungry I would rather we pressed on. We still have a long way to go."</p>\r\n<p>"Then we bid you safe journey," said Fenor and helped her mount her horse.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, Fenor, I nearly forgot!" Tielan swung his horse around and walked it over to where Fenor was standing on the steps of the caravan. "When you see my father, tell him there''s been a landslide on the High Pass. I think it''s irreparable but he''ll want to send someone out to check, I didn''t have the time for a proper look. And tell them all we''re making pretty good time and I''ll be back before they know it."</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll make sure Lara gets your message, and I''ll give her your love as well," grinned Fenor.</p>\r\n<p>"Is there anybody that doesn''t know?" groaned Tielan.</p>\r\n<p>"Not now Tielan, " Fenor winked, "I''d say you were the last one!"</p>\r\n<p>Red-faced but smiling, Tielan swung his horses'' head, kicked his heels and urged it back into the lead of the group. Riding behind, Alyse stared at his back with a troubled expression.</p>\r\n<p>“Do you want to share?” Cymon’s touch stroked the edges of her mind.</p>\r\n<p>“I am not sure?” Alyse replied hesitantly. She turned her head to face him. “Tenora. When I was healing her, she kept crying out.”</p>\r\n<p>“There is nothing strange about that. You said yourself she was in agony and near death. Dying people often cry out.”</p>\r\n<p>“Cymon... she was calling out for Tielan!” </p>\r\n<p>“Now that is strange. You''d expect her to call for her parents. Then again, these gypsies seem pretty close. They could be related for all we know. He might be a favourite uncle or cousin,” he mused. </p>\r\n<p>“I suppose that is possible.” Her mental sigh was like a chill wind and Cymon felt a shiver run up his spine. “I have a bad feeling about this Cymon.” </p>\r\n<p>“I have a bad feeling about everything lately,” he returned tightly and reached for her hand. “The sooner we get to Phelise the better I''ll like it.” </p>\r\n<p>Three days later they were moving easily through the foothills, heading for the border between Westbrooke and the Great Plain. As they drew closer to Talgheer, Cymon all but forgot their conversation, his attention claimed by the uneasy quietness and distinct lack of activity on the roads. Considering the time of year they would have expected to encounter any number of merchants and travellers. The few that they did meet gave them a frosty reception or a wide berth. In fact everywhere they went, they received short shrift, suspicion and even, in some cases, outright fear. Villagers kept themselves behind closed shutters and locked doors they refused to answer. Some of the inns declared themselves full, despite the fact that they were devoid of people and there were no horses or wagons in sight. Farmers ordered them off their land and told them keep moving. They were hard pressed to find assistance anywhere, save for the odd, kindly old soul who invariably had little enough for themselves, let alone enough to share. All of these told the same story. More and more robbers and cutthroats were prowling the roads and villages, alone and in groups. Strange things prowled in the shadows, lengthening the night with their eerie cries. Everywhere it seemed, there was fighting, deaths and disappearances.</p>\r\n<p>"Tis a sad state of affairs the world is coming to," they would say, shaking their heads sadly. </p>\r\n<p>"And worse to come," Cymon or Alyse would reply, warning them as best they could and telling them to spread the word amongst their friends.</p>\r\n<p>They travelled cautiously, weapons always at the ready. Alyse probed the way ahead for danger and thanks to her ability to do so. They were able to avoid trouble on more than one occasion. Cutting down their rations by half meant they did not go completely hungry but even so, they knew they would not have enough to see them to the gateway. They would have to try and pick some up in Talgheer, where the lights were now an orange glow on the horizon. Rather than risk the danger of them all going into city, Tielan volunteered to go alone, since he had been there many times and knew it well. </p>\r\n<p>“We cannot let him go!” Alyse cried silently to Cymon, though outwardly her expression remained calm and placid.</p>\r\n<p>"It''ll be better if I go," Cymon said to Tielan. "I can cloak myself in whatever appearance I choose, so if anyone''s watching out for us, they won''t know who follow from one moment to the next. Plus I''ll have Defiant... so I won''t be alone if it comes to a fight."</p>\r\n<p>So it was Cymon that, early the next morning, set off at a gallop towards Talgheer leaving Alyse and Jarok under Tielan’s guard in a small coppice, heavy with brambles and undergrowth that any unwelcome visitor would find difficult to penetrate without being heard. He did not intend to be long and had warned Alyse and Jarok not to stray outside the coppice. Royle had padded off patrolling the perimeter and so, knowing Tielan was with them inside, Cymon felt confident that they would be safe until his return. He could not have known how wrong he was. </p>\r\n<p>Tielan calculated that Cymon was unlikely to return before late evening, so they had all day to rest and relax away the aches of travelling. Alyse and Tielan talked for a while and played ''I spy'' with Jarok until, growing tired of the inactivity, he asked if he might go and see if he could find anything interesting for his pouch.</p>\r\n<p>"Remember what Cymon said. Stay this side of the trees, where we can see you," Alyse reminded him.</p>\r\n<p>"I will," he promised, walking off with his eyes glued to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse leaned back on one elbow, watching him turning over the soft dirt and fallen leaf covering. Every so often he would pick something up, examine it and either pop it in his pouch or put it back in the exact spot he had taken it from.</p>\r\n<p>"He reminds me of a magpie I saw once," laughed Tielan. "Hopped right in the window, bold as brass. Had that same gleam in its eye as it searched through the things lying on the table before it grabbed my Mother’s earring in its beak and flew off. Talking of which... " Tielan slipped his hand into his shirt pocket and pulled out a carving he was working on.</p>\r\n<p>"I would value your opinion," he said, holding it out for her to take.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse turned the half finished article over in her hands. The exquisitely carved bird was tiny... no bigger than her thumb and it clung, one wing outstretched onto the stem of a delicate, half opened rosebud.</p>\r\n<p>"It is beautiful, Tielan. For Lara?"</p>\r\n<p>"Her betrothal gift," he nodded. "D''you think she''ll like it? It''s more customary to buy a bracelet or a necklace. Perhaps I could bore a hole and thread?"</p>\r\n<p>"No, that would spoil it," she quashed the idea quickly, handing it back to him. "Lara will love it exactly as it is, I am sure."</p>\r\n<p>Her smile of reassurance froze on her lips as a tingle ran down her spine. She reached out to locate Royle. Alert but undisturbed, he continued his patrol of the perimeter. If there was something, it had not come his way. The horses were also calm and there was no noise except for the faint rustling of leaves in the breeze. She rose to her feet, turning slowly...&nbsp;probing for any consciousness that was not their own. She could find nothing. No stray thoughts or leak of psychic energy so common in the untrained mind. She frowned. She was tense, she told herself, on edge with Cymon gone and had probably imagined it. She looked across to where Jarok was engrossed in his searching. There was no sign of any movement in his vicinity and her enhanced vision could see no danger lurking in the undergrowth. Yet her anxiety grew. Her heart was thumping, her palms were sweating and her mouth became suddenly dry. </p>\r\n<p>"Alyse?" asked Tielan, eyes scanning the area.</p>\r\n<p>"There is something out there," she replied uneasily. "At least... I thought I sensed something but... "</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t see or hear anything, just the... Again?" he interrupted himself as the colour drained from her face. </p>\r\n<p>"Stronger than before," she nodded, rubbing her palms down her trousers.</p>\r\n<p>"Stay here... I''m going to fetch Jarok... if we shout, it may provoke an attack." He strode almost casually to where Jarok was squatting on the ground, squinting into the dim light between the trees as he listened intently for any tell-tale noise that might tell him who, or what, the mysterious presence might be. There was nothing... except...</p>\r\n<p>As he drew closer to the boy he began to notice a strange aroma. It was like nothing he had smelt before and he stopped for moment to sniff the air. A sudden gust of wind through the coppice picked up the scent and carried it to where Alyse stood trembling beside the fire. Her nostrils flared as she breathed in the heavy, yet light fragrance laced with an underlying tang of evil. She centred her search upon the smell as the undergrowth continued to rustle despite the fact that the wind had died and the trees in the coppice stood quietly motionless. </p>\r\n<p>"The plants, Tielan! It is the plants,” she shouted as Jarok, taken by the exotic mix of the Sectii lure, rose and stepped towards the mottled green mass of flora. </p>\r\n<p>At the sound of her voice the Sectii immediately sprang to life. Six of them... dotted about the area where Jarok had been. Startled by her cry, Jarok swung around, lost his balance and stumbled directly within striking distance of the nearest. Its eye cluster opened as it unfurled its wings, a deadly tendril whipping out and aiming straight for Jarok’s neck. With lightening speed, Tielan hurled himself through the air... knocking Jarok off balance and landing on top of him. The tendril struck the empty space where Jarok had been and recoiled. Tielan jumped up, dragging Jarok to his feet with him and shielding him from their attacker with his own body. They had taken only a couple of steps when another Sectus unfurled beside them. Tielan slashed out with his sword, slicing at the Sectus just below the eye cluster and severing it in two. But it was too late... its barbed sting had already penetrated deep into his side. Almost immediately he felt the numbing influence of its venom beginning to take hold. His legs began to drag and other Sectii struck at him. With the last of his strength and mobility, he lifted Jarok and threw him... as high and as far as he could... away from the reach of the Sectii. Alyse cried out and ran towards her brother as he crashed heavily to the ground, his leg twisted, and obviously broken, beneath him and blood spurting from his nose and mouth. The Sectii were faster and already had him surrounded and they were closing in for the kill. Hissing and spitting, Royle erupted from amongst the trees but was unable to find a way past their lethal stings to protect the helpless boy. Alyse watched with surging panic as Duman’s minions flicked death closer and closer to the moaning body of her brother.</p>\r\n<p>"No,” she cried, her insides heaving and swelling with angry desperation. </p>\r\n<p>"No! NO! NO! "</p>\r\n<p>The first wave came as a blast of air. Screeching through the coppice like the wail of an avenging banshee as her emotions snapped and the energy within surged outwards, raging, screaming out of control.</p>\r\n<p>The second burst caused a loud rumbling and shifting of the earth. A deep crack opened up in the ground next to where Jarok lay. At the same time the earth rose up over the roots of the Sectii and turned to stone, trapping the Sectii where they stood. </p>\r\n<p>The third and most powerful wave, erupted in a belt of molten lava... white hot and hissing with sizzling intensity... that rose up from the ground beneath her feet, gorging everything in its path as it raced towards the Sectii. </p>\r\n<p>It was at this moment that Jarok’s eyelids flickered open and he watched with horror as Alyse’s fury advanced towards him. He did not know that it was not directed at him and would sweep harmlessly around him. He knew only terror.</p>\r\n<p>"Mother! Help me,” he cried out as, screaming with pain, he tried to roll out of its path. Suddenly he was falling through the air. Down and down into the chasm Alyse had created to save him. Endlessly deeper, away from terrified screams that echoed upwards to the rapidly disappearing pinprick of light. The air pressed in on him as he fell, crushing the breath from his lungs until there was nothing. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s screams were echoed by Alyse’s own, as she watched him disappear. By some extreme effort she manage to reel in the Power she had unleashed. Grabbing a brand from the fire she rushed across to where Jarok had been and thrust the light downwards. Horror and grief ripped her apart as she realised she could not see the bottom.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok,” she screamed desperately. </p>\r\n<p>"Jarok... arok... rok."&nbsp;The empty echo returned from the depths to taunt her.</p>\r\n<p>"What have I done?" she sobbed. "What have I done?" </p>\r\n<p>''CYMON!''</p>\r\n<p>Sinking to the ground and leaning over the edge of the gaping split she had rendered in the Earth, she stared for an endless age into the blackness. The distressed whinnying of the horses finally impinged upon the edges of her grief and slowly she looked up to where they stood quivering, eyes rolling in terror as they strained at their tethers. To her left was Royle, stunned unconscious, his breathing laboured as blood dripped from a gash upon his head. The blackened ashes of Sectii and other plant life encircled her and beyond this, just a few feet away, lay the remains of Tielan. His insides were dissolving from the acidic venom injected into him and seeping out in sticky goo from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Fists clenched against her mouth, she gazed as from afar at the chaos around her and at the trail of blood leading to nowhere that was all she had left of her beloved brother. Guilt, grief and shock thrust like knives into her heart and throwing back her head, she screamed Jarok’s name with all the pain and anguish of a wounded Dragon. </p>\r\n<p>Her cry rose up into the night and was answered by a thunderous roar as the heavens shed tears of rain for her loss. </p>\r\n<p>So it was that Cymon found her some time later, still collapsed limply in the spot where Jarok had last lain. Her body soaked to the skin and her mind so numbed with grief and pain that she responded to neither word or touch. He had returned as quickly as Defiant could run when her scream had torn through his mind. Unable to make contact with her after that, he had feared something had happened to her and worried too about the state Jarok would be in. It never occurred to him that it might be the other way round. </p>\r\n<p>Receiving no answer to his approaching hails, it was with some trepidation that Cymon had forced himself to enter the coppice. The horses came into view first, still tethered, as they had been when he had left. Then he spotted Alyse, sitting in a bedraggled heap and though his heart leapt to see her safe, his stomach was a hollow pit of sickness as he realised there was no sign of Jarok or Tielan. He leapt from Defiant’s back.</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse?" he called, dropping to his knees in front of her but she remained silent and unmoving as a statue. He laid his palms against her cheeks. She was stiff and cold. Gently he lifted her head and found blank eyes staring into nothing. With a cry he gathered her into his arms, kissing her softly on the forehead and whispering her name over and over. No matter how much he pleaded, she would not respond. He would have to try another way. He set her down beside him and began shaking her roughly. </p>\r\n<p>"Alyse? What happened?" he demanded, shaking her some more when she did not respond. "I need to know what happened here. Alyse, please. Jarok and Tielan? Where are they?"</p>\r\n<p>Her head flopped back and forth as he shook her again and again, until he feared her neck might break and stopped.</p>\r\n<p>"Answer me,” he shouted, slapping her cheeks with both sides of his hand. At last something moved. Her eyes strayed past his head towards the trees and a pile of old rags on his right. On dragging feet, he went over to where they lay. Horror and revulsion washed over him and he dropped to the ground, retching violently. When his stomach was empty, he forced himself to look again.</p>\r\n<p>"Merciful Mother,” he breathed. "What could have done such a thing?"</p>\r\n<p>Though there was little left, he knew it was Tielan... he recognised the earrings the gipsy wore and his ring, floating atop the puddle of oozing stickiness, a silver eagle inlaid in a gold circle. Taking a deep breath to steel himself, he reached out and retrieved it. He cleaned it on his jacket and slipped it into his pocket. Then he noticed something else, a small carving that he also retrieved, cleaned and slipped into his pocket with the ring. His heart heavy with sadness and fear, he forced himself to search the coppice for Jarok’s remains but found only Royle, battered but still alive. He took off his jacket and laid it over the cat, telling him to ''hold on'', then went back to Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t find Jarok," he told her, in as calm as tone as he could manage. "Alyse? Where''s Jarok? Where is he?"</p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s body quivered and her eyes blinked open onto pools of remorse. Then it was gone... and she with it. He grabbed her to him. Tears of despair that this time he had lost her forever were mixing with the rain on her hair. He reached out but her mind was sealed tighter than the Vaults of Wisdom in the Oaken Chamber. He kissed the top of her head then released her slowly, placing two fingers against her forehead before he stood up to see what he could do for Royle. Tielan’s remains accused him as he turned and suddenly all his pity and fear was gone in a flood of fury. His arm rose of its own volition and his hand came down across Alyse’s face with all his strength.</p>\r\n<p>"Your brother, Alyse?" he leaned over, dragging her head back by her hair and breathing hot scorn into her face. "Remember him? The boy you claim to love so dearly? Where is he?"</p>\r\n<p>The flaming welts rising on her face failed to soften his mood and when she sat silent, his arm lifted again. A hairsbreadth from her flesh his wrist was caught in a vice-like grip, his arm was twisted back until he was on his knees.</p>\r\n<p>"Stay thy hand, Elf. For though we doest love thee truly... we shalt not permit thee to strike us again."</p>\r\n<p>It took a while for the deep-toned command of Ecos to register and even when it did,</p>\r\n<p>Cymon continued to tug and prise at the fingers that held them until, unable to do so, his mind cooled and his body sagged in surrender.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry. I don''t know what," he pressed his palms against his temples and took a deep breath. "Tielan is dead. I can''t find Jarok. She... I just need her to tell me... to wake her up from her stupor. I have to make her... to find, " his voice began to rise in desperation.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou wilt not succeed, for she hath no desire to return and her will is stronger than thine. Truly, she wouldst rather die."</p>\r\n<p>"But why?" demanded Cymon, his brow riddled with confusion. "I know she must be hurting about Tielan but I can''t find," he hesitated, "anything else, so whoever did this must have taken Jarok with them. All we..." </p>\r\n<p>"Jarok is dead." </p>\r\n<p>The flat, blunt tones in which the statement was issued hit Cymon like a blow and sent him toppling onto his backside, eyes wide and his mouth hanging open in his shaking head. </p>\r\n<p>"How? Where? Who...? Cymon heard himself babbling from afar.</p>\r\n<p>"Twas Alyse that struck him down."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon stared at the damning lips in frozen disbelief. </p>\r\n<p>"Alyse?" his puzzled whisper echoed in his mind. </p>\r\n<p>"Alyse?" </p>\r\n<p>He dropped his head tugging his fingers roughly through his hair hoping the pain might bring order to the shattered pieces of his mind. </p>\r\n<p>"No. Alyse would never hurt Jarok." </p>\r\n<p>He was talking to himself but the Dragon answered.</p>\r\n<p>"As with thee, t''was not her intent. Duman’s minions attacked us and she sought to protect him. Jarok didst not understand the nature of the Power and sought to evade its path." Alyse’s hand lifted and Ecos pointed to the crevice beside them. "Now he is gone. Now there is nothing. We grieve for our loss and for the world. Leave us in peace."</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t do that," answered Cymon, his love for Alyse shimmering through his tears. </p>\r\n<p>"Thou canst and wilt," Ecos words were strung with anger, "for wast it not thine own failure to protect us that hath brought us to this? Thou shouldst not have abandoned us,</p>\r\n<p>Elf. Jarok is gone... through thy hand, as well as hers... and we art all lost."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon closed his eyes. Yes. He had failed to protect Jarok, as he promised but Alyse was still alive and though his heart was ripped apart, he put aside his grief for the boy with a determination that he would not fail Alyse... nor allow her to fail herself. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he wiped away his tears and stared the Dragon straight in the eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"I loved Jarok too. He was very special: brave and full of promise. But I can''t help him now and it will serve no purpose to lose Alyse as well. Jarok wouldn''t want that any more than I do. Please, you must help me to reach her. The world has no chance against Duman without her."</p>\r\n<p>He drew back, confused by the Dragon’s bitter laughter.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou understandeth nothing. Go home Elf." </p>\r\n<p>The dripping condescension of the Dragon’s tone re-ignited Cymon’s earlier anger and he jumped to his feet, leaning over with his fists on his hips and, at any other time would have laughed at this almost perfect imitation of Alyse herself. But his thoughts were far from amused right now.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re right," he agreed with scathing self-contempt. "I don''t understand... not any of this whole, sorry mess, but then I''m just an Elf &mdash; a mere mortal. Young and quite obviously stupid, since no one seems to think I can manage anything except basic commands. </p>\r\n<p>“Go fetch the girl,” order the Elders, as a child sends a dog after a stick.</p>\r\n<p>''Trust me,”says Alyse, while she does things beyond my imagining without explanation.</p>\r\n<p>“And you...’ He paused for a moment, taking a deep breath to stoke the burning fire in his eyes that even scorched the blazing orbs in Alyse’s otherwise colourless face. "Well, you are the worst of all! Ecos, the mighty Dragon, sneering down his nose at the lesser mortal. Brushing me aside as if I were nothing. By the Mother... Duman would be so proud of you!"</p>\r\n<p>Amber flashed red in warning but Cymon was now full spate into his tirade and disregarded it, always supposing that he even noticed it at all!</p>\r\n<p>"Well, let me tell you something...Sir All-powerful and Mighty Dragon,” he spat vehemently. "Of the three of you that I''ve known, only one has proved to have the backbone to stand strong through all adversity, to be utterly selfless and think of others before himself. Jarok wouldn''t have sat wallowing in self pity while his friend was hurt, maybe dying," he pointed to Royle, still unconscious on the ground. "He wouldn''t have abandoned the world to hide from his pain. He would''ve faced his grief, accepted his pain and sacrificed anything to save them both. Why? Because the Mother’s love for Her children was stronger in him than his love of self. I guess all those grand speeches of yours were just words after all. You disgust me!" </p>\r\n<p>Anger spent, he spun on his heel and started to walk away. Suddenly he was grabbed from behind and spun back around to confront the Alyse of the Knights'' camp. His heart skipped a beat but he stood his ground, refusing to let his fear show.</p>\r\n<p>Time hung suspended as he waited for the Dragon to make its move. When the grip on his arm loosened, he began to believe he might yet see the morrow. Red was banked to anger and then to a yellow so pale it was almost white. There was no anger in the Dragon’s voice, or even irritation. Cymon would have preferred either or anything in between, to the flat tones of defeat.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou speaketh truly, Elf. Thou hast indeed been sorely used. We art sorry now that we didst not reveal this secret unto thee sooner... perhaps things mayest hath turned out differently... but our thoughts wert ever for the child’s protection. Thou thinkest ''tis we who shalt battle the wizard." There was no amusement in the Dragon’s laughter. "Thou thinkest wrong. We art no match for Duman and never shalt be. ''Twas Jarok who wast the ''Chosen''... not Alyse."</p>\r\n<p>For a second time, Cymon hit the ground with a thump. Ecos sat Alyse beside him. </p>\r\n<p>"This union wast not of mine doing, mine brothers acted of their own accord. There wast nothing I couldst hath done even hath I known. Not without placing the child in danger. I didst try to remain dormant, secreting mineself in the farthest reaches of her psyche. Hath I been able to do so, then mayhap Jarok wouldst hath grown enough to embrace his destiny. Alas, events unfolded as they didst and thus twas imperative that he reach the safety of Phelise."</p>\r\n<p>"Who?" </p>\r\n<p>The single word could have started any number of questions but Ecos replied to the one stuck on Cymon’s tongue. </p>\r\n<p>"Twas the Powerwielders'' decision to act as decoy, to delay and divert Duman’s attention for as long as we wert able, since he wast already aware of our existence &mdash;twas our hope to gain enough time for Jarok to reach his full potential. So now thou knowest everything and that everything is pointless. Doth the knowing set thy mind at peace? </p>\r\n<p>Without the Chosen we art doomed to failure. Duman hath already won!"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s mind was reeling, tying itself in knots trying to sift and make some sense of what he had just heard. It was so unbelievable it had to be true and what reason would the Dragon have to lie. He recalled Jarok’s feyness, his often-strange behaviour and his intimate rapport with nature. Jarok’s face flashed into his mind, that moment when the boy understood exactly who was after Alyse. Features torn with fear and desperation he had clutched at Cymon’s arm but his cry had been fierce with determination to get Alyse to Phelise. Cymon took that determination and made it his own. Promising the absent boy he would not let him down, he got up and took a deep breath. The image of Jarok’s face seemed to smile before it faded.</p>\r\n<p>"You say our cause is hopeless. Maybe so," he said over his shoulder, as he went to pick up Royle. "But that doesn''t mean we should simply give up. There''s a vision to be unravelled. A vision in which, I remind you, Alyse has a part: a tomb to find, and the Elven Elite to set march on, and promises to keep. With or without you, I''m going on. Duman’s not going to have it all his own way... whether it''s fated to be so or not! If I''m to die, then I''ll die on my terms. Fighting and resisting to my final breath! All I ask from you is to heal the cat." He laid Royle on Alyse’s lap. </p>\r\n<p>"Spoken in the true spirit of the A''mathan! Thou shamest me and rightly so. I wilt heal thine friend and then I must leave thee. I hath held sway in this body for too long of mine own accord and the urge to remain grows stronger. How long before the Powerwielder wilt return, I knowest not. She is too deep in her grief at this time to heed thy words or mine, but I wilt keep trying."</p>\r\n<p>Royale’s body glowed beneath Alyse’s hands. His mewl was weak but his injuries were gone and Ecos laid him gently aside, nodded and departed. Cymon caught Alyse’s limp body and rested it alongside Royale’s then gathered all their possessions together between one of the roans and Tielan’s black. The other roan he saddled for himself, along with the basket for Royle, so that he could commit Alyse into Defiant’s care. When he had done this, he piled some sticks and branches over and around Tielan’s remains. It was not the customary manner but the gipsy deserved something and since the Elfin in him could not bring itself to place the remains underground in the fashion of men and there was no way he could get them atop the pyre, he decided it was the next best thing &mdash; a sort of merging of the two customs. He lit a lantern and held it high, so that Tielan’s spirit might have light on his journey to the Mother, while he recited the Elfin... ''Farewell to the Dead''. </p>\r\n<p>"... I knew him for only a heartbeat of his life but he was a good friend, loyal and selfless to the end. I shall carry his memory till the end of my days and his name shall henceforth be included in my lineage," Cymon finished in his own words as was the custom. "Guide him home swiftly, Mother of all and send comfort to his family. Fare thee well, friend</p>\r\n<p>Tielan, until we meet again in the arms of the Mother." He bowed his head in respectful silence for a moment before throwing the lantern onto the pyre. When he was certain the fire had taken hold, he strapped Alyse safely onto Defiant, mounted the roan and led his sadly depleted group out of the coppice.</p>\r\n<p>Grief rose in him with the smoke from the crackling flames of the pyre. He hardened his heart, swallowed his tears and set his mind to Phelise. There was too much ahead to let go now... later he would grieve. Thus resolved, he nudged his horse into a fast trot towards home.</p>\r\n<p>Thunder roared overhead like the bellowing trumpet of a tormented Dragon. Rain lashed upon the window of the caravan where the old Sharran lay, skeletal fingers plucking at the sheets. A grim-faced Gwym sat beside her, a vigil he had kept almost constantly since Tielan’s departure. As days went by, he began to hope her vision would not come to pass. Then she uttered the words he had been dreading.</p>\r\n<p>"So it was seen... so it has come to pass!"</p>\r\n<p>The flat, expressionless tone smashed into his heart like a sledgehammer and it splintered into a million pieces. He clenched his teeth against the trembling of his chin. Behind closed lids, Tielan’s face emerged. Smiling. Laughing. Eyes aglow with joyful humour. A young face full of life and promise. Eyes that still had a lifetime of things to see. A youthful face that would remain eternally so, would never grow old and wrinkle, never be ravaged by grief and loss, never gaze in wonder upon his children and his grandchildren.</p>\r\n<p>"You should have chosen me," he told his grandmother, so angry in his grief that he could not bear to look at her any more and so he rose and walked to the door. "I don''t know if I can ever forgive you for what you''ve done."</p>\r\n<p>"You were not the choice offered," he voice stopped his hand on the door handle. "And Eona will need you. She''s still so young to take on the mantle of Sharran."</p>\r\n<p>"Eona is strong. She would have had Tielan. You... "</p>\r\n<p>"Aiee!" </p>\r\n<p>His grandmother’s anguished scream rent the air and all else forgotten, he rushed back to her side and cradled her quivering body in his arms. </p>\r\n<p>"Grandmother. What is it?"</p>\r\n<p>She ignored him, turning instead to Eona, who had come bursting through the door at her cry.</p>\r\n<p>"It can''t be! Was not to be! The vision was clear! Clear,” she clawed at Gwyms hand. "Why else would I have given the blood of my blood? What sick and cruel twist of fate could do this? What good the sight if bears me false? False and cruel, no longer will I follow it, no longer,” she began clawing at her eyes. Gwym grabbed her hands and pinned them down.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s happened? What''s she talking about?" Eona asked fearfully, dropping to her knees beside the cot.</p>\r\n<p>"Tielan is dead."</p>\r\n<p>"Tielan? No! He can''t be,” denied Eona, shaking her head. "Not Tielan!" Hot tears spilt down her ashen face.</p>\r\n<p>"She knew it was going to happen and she sent him anyway," Gwym could not stop the bitterness from spilling out.</p>\r\n<p>"But why?" cried Eona. "Why?" she demanded of the old woman, grabbing her hands and squeezing them painfully in her distress. "Why? You told me there is always a choice, and that visions aren''t set. That they''re only a possible future, that there''s always hope, always a choice," her voice tailed off in disbelief. "You chose him," she breathed softly and then her anger rose. "You chose him?" she screamed.</p>\r\n<p>The Sharran snatched her hands away. For a moment the strength and authority of her position returned to her face and stared at Eona in disdain. And then her features crumbled once more.</p>\r\n<p>"It was all for nothing. Nothing,” she cried. "His life... his death... our pain... my agony, all were for nothing... lies, lies and deceit,” she raved, clutching her chest. "Aeii! I cannot bear it!" Her hands reached for Eona’s face, fingers pressing against the girls'' closed eyelids. "Show me thy sight!" She demanded and pleaded together. "Let me be gone from this place. Let me leave this service. Please... I beg you... show me thy sight!"</p>\r\n<p>Eona slumped to the floor, leaning her head on the edge of the cot. She felt torn and sick in mind and body. She longed desperately to lie. Part of her filled with anger bitterness, wanting the old woman to suffer for Tielan’s death, to deny her the peace of release while Eona and her father must carry on in grief and torment. Part of her wanted her grandmother to stay because she loved her. It was this part that made her sit on the edge of the cot. Take the old Sharran’s hands, kiss their wrists and then place their fingers upon her eyes. It was this part that spoke the ceremonial words.</p>\r\n<p>"You have served the people long and well, Sharran that was. But now your task is done. The circle of your life has reached its beginning. My eyes see clearly now through the Mists of Time for I... the Sharran... have received a vision and given it to the Powerwielder. And so I relieve you of your burden. You may sleep in peace knowing that I shall guide the footsteps of our people with all the wisdom that you have taught me." She wrapped her arms about her grandmother, kissed her forehead and then gently rested her back on the pillows, arms folded across her chest. "From my arms... to the Mother’s arms."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you my child." The old woman’s voice was so weak they could barely hear it. "If anyone can know happiness in the midst of tragedy, then know you have made me happy this day." Her eyelids fluttered down and her last breath escaped on a soft sigh.</p>\r\n<p>"It is done!"</p>\r\n<p>Eona rose to her feet. Took off her torque and replaced it with the one from about her grandmothers neck. She closed the curtains and turned up the lantern.</p>\r\n<p>"Father, we must go and let her make her journey. Our presence here will only make it harder for her to find the path home."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym did not move. Eona laid a hand on his shoulder but he shrugged it off.</p>\r\n<p>"Why?" the soft question rose from inside his crumpled spirit. "You waited for months. Why couldn''t you wait a little longer? Why both today?" He rose and turned slowly. There was no accusation, no anger or bitterness in his tone. He was too numb to raise the energy. He just wanted to know why.</p>\r\n<p>"Because I loved her too much to let her suffer. Her belief in the ''Sight'' was shattered. Without this she had nothing left. Nothing to give her the strength to shoulder the pain of her decision or bear the loss of Tielan."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"And you? Are you strong enough?"</p>\r\n<p>"My feelings are irrelevant, there is none to take my place. Only my duty is of any consequence."</p>\r\n<p>"But...?"</p>\r\n<p>"We will speak of this no more,” she commanded. "We must leave now."</p>\r\n<p>Taken aback by her forceful tone, Gwym opened his mouth to argue. The light from the lantern reflected in the golden torque as she turned. His mouth closed. She was no longer his daughter, he suddenly realised and moved passed her to open the door.</p>\r\n<p>"As you wish Sharran," he bowed his respectfully as she passed through it.</p>\r\n<p>Back in their own caravan, Gwym made some tea for Eona and poured himself some wine. They sat quietly, each coming to terms with their loss in their own way. As Gwym looked up from his glass, he noticed Eona’s stiff posture and the white knuckles gripping the edge of the table.</p>\r\n<p>''So, it begins already,'' he thought, moving quietly outside to find Malinka and ask her to prepare some of the old Sharran’s restorative. By the time Malinka tapped gently on the door, Eona was back. They waited, refusing to let her speak until she finished the mug Malinka had brought. Eona swallowed the last drop, thanked Malinka and handed her the empty mug and the turned to Gwym.</p>\r\n<p>"A woman lay on her bed, covered in the sores of a plague that ravaged her body. She tried to fight it, taking all manner of herbs and medicines. They slowed it for a while but each time the plague returned and each time she grew weaker. A man came to her, a man with golden loops in his ears, bearing a rare herb known only to a few. She took the herb and the man went on his way, to give it others who were sick."</p>\r\n<p>"What does it mean?"</p>\r\n<p>"The woman is Rohansuk... her health... the people thereof... the plague... the enemy... the herbs and medicines... places of safety and hiding... </p>\r\n<p>The man is clearly gipsy. The rare herb... there is only one place I know of that is a rare and secret place known only to a few... "</p>\r\n<p>"Ador’s plateau,” cried Gwym.</p>\r\n<p>"Once again it will become a safe haven for those in need. We shall move the camp there tomorrow. We will talk to Ador about setting up a refuge. I''m sure he will agree."</p>\r\n<p>"But the Sharran’s Felkira?" gasped Malinka from her seat in the corner.</p>\r\n<p>"Will be held tonight."</p>\r\n<p>"Tonight?" repeated Gwym. "The tribe will never accept... "</p>\r\n<p>"The tribe will do as the Sharran commands,” Eona pronounced, striking the table forcefully. She took a deep breath. "I''m sorry, father," she continued in gentler tones. "I know what you''re going through but this can''t wait until the full moon. You spoke to me once of changes," she laid a hand over his. "This will be the first of many. A second arrives on the morrow. The Felkira must be over and my position fully established before she arrives."</p>\r\n<p>Gwym kissed her wrist and then stood and kissed her forehead.</p>\r\n<p>"I understand. I will gather the tribe and prepare for the Felkira." </p>\r\n\r\n</div>', 1, 21, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(27, 'City of stone', 'CHAPTER FIFTEEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="D" src="D.gif">avin and Tynan had ridden hard and fast after they had left Alyse and Cymon now they scoured Port Canest for passage to Katatuk. It was not easy; the port was unusually full of less reputable captains that looked as though they might throw them overboard the moment they were out of sight of land. Neither Davin nor Tynan were happy about these travelling arrangements since both made poor sailors but as Katatuk was the largest in a chain of volcanic islands rising up out of the Straits of Dorda, they had very little choice. It was sail or swim! Eventually though, with the help of a friendly tavern keeper, they managed to track down the necessary party. After agreeing a fair price, they stabled their horses and board ship ready to sail on the morning tide. <p></p>\r\n<p>Two weeks after leaving the mainland, they stood in the prow of the cargo vessel that bobbed up and down on the gentle waves, just east of Katatuk. Both wore pale green complexions. But beneath his sickly pallor, Davin’s face was worn with a great weariness of spirit. His shoulders were slumped in defeat as he leant over the rail and stared at the wave-crested waves below. Tynan watched him quietly, his own face filled with pity and concern. He had suggested a walk about the deck when the captain had told them they were coming into sight of the Dwarven Isles, in the hope it might bring some inspiration. Less than one day out and they still had no plan of action. Davin was wishing he had stayed in the cabin were he could be sick in peace. He had agreed to Tynan’s suggestion for similar reasons. That seeing the Dwarven homeland might give him some feel for the people. All he had seen so far was stark, bald rock. And all he felt was a sense of something solid, immeasurable, immovable. Tynan’s cheerful voice fell like a millstone into the pool of his depression.</p>\r\n<p>"So? Any ideas yet?"</p>\r\n<p>Davin ground his teeth as he swung to face him.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, yes! How about... grab your weapons you''re going to war," he snarled impatiently.</p>\r\n<p>"Hmm!" Tynan frowned thoughtfully, choosing to ignore his friends'' show of temper.</p>\r\n<p>"Succinct and to the point," he nodded. "Slightly lacking somewhat in the diplomacy department... but it''s not bad. The ''let''s not beat about the bush approach''. I like it!"</p>\r\n<p>Davin thumped the rail with his gloved fist, in no mood for Tynan’s jesting.</p>\r\n<p>"I told her I wasn''t cut out for this!"</p>\r\n<p>"No, you didn''t actually. You might have thought it but... "</p>\r\n<p>Davin thumped the rail again, so hard that somewhere along its length it objected with a loud crack. Tynan looked at Davin’s dark scowl and thought it best to be quiet before the next one landed on his jaw. He was starting to think he wasn''t cut out for his part in this mission either. He had never known Davin to fall into so foul a mood.</p>\r\n<p>"How long has it been now? Two weeks... three?"</p>\r\n<p>Tynan opened his mouth then shut it again. Perhaps it was better Davin did not remember exactly how long it had been. </p>\r\n<p>"Long enough. We''re almost there and that''s the best I''ve come up with. It''s pitiful!" He spun back to stare into the water. The maltreated rail creaked again. Tynan groaned. They were going to end up having to buy the captain a whole knew ship if he kept this up. Very carefully, he laid a hand on Davin’s shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"You’ll do better on the day, you''ll see," he promised, crossing mental fingers. "You know you always think better on your feet."</p>\r\n<p>"Not this time, Tynan. It''s hopeless," Davin shook his miserably, but at least he left the rail alone; which Tynan took as a good sign. </p>\r\n<p>"Rubbish,” snapped Tynan. "You''ve already made a start... Okay, I''ll admit it''s not much," he said, holding his hands up in defence as Davin’s eyes narrowed angrily, "but it is a start. And it''s honest," he thought quickly, stepping back as Davin straightened and pushed himself away from the rail. "Isn''t that why the Lady Alyse chose you in the first place, because you were honest and trustworthy? Then there''s still the Dragonmark and Cymon’s medallion to fall back on. Or you could beat them into submission," he looked down at Davin’s curled fist. </p>\r\n<p>"Sorry, Tynan. I don''t know what''s the matter with me," he uncurled his fingers and pressed his hand flat on the rail. </p>\r\n<p>"Not enough sleep and nothing in your stomach, and probably a chill from standing up here in the cold. Whose stupid idea was this, anyway?" Tynan shivered and pulled his cloak closer about himself. "Let''s go back below. I''ve got a bottle of fine purple grape in my bag. If nothing else, it''ll give you such a blinding headache you''ll forget about all your other problems," he laughed, slapping Davin heartily on the back, who at least tried to smile in return.</p>\r\n<p>"Excuse me, Good Sirs," piped a gruff voice. The smallest man they had ever seen stepped out from behind a stack of crates lashed down a few strides ahead of them. No taller then waist height with shoulder length brown hair and a thick beard, down to his bulging middle, that accentuated his bulbous nose. At first sight he was a funny-looking thing however, his sturdy, muscular upper body, assured posture and the large axe tucked prominently into the belt holding up his baggy trousers, repelled ridicule. Solid and immovable, the words jumped back into Davin’s mind. He pushed the lock of hair back from his forehead, noting that he was not going to need Tynan’s wine to start that headache.</p>\r\n<p>"What?"</p>\r\n<p>Tynan frowned at Davin, both for the tone and the rudeness of the words itself, but the dwarf seemed not to take offence so he kept quiet.</p>\r\n<p>"I couldn''t but help overhearing your conversation," the dwarf began.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s called eavesdropping," snapped Davin.</p>\r\n<p>The dwarfs'' eyes widened slightly but he let the remark pass, seeing that the man was clearly ill.</p>\r\n<p>"You appear to be in something of a quandary and while I hesitate to add to it, I fear there is a greater problem that you both seem to have overlooked."</p>\r\n<p>"No doubt you''ll be glad to enlighten us,” snarled Davin. All he needed now was another problem. The dwarfs'' eyes narrowed and his nostrils flared. One he had let go; two he had ignored: but three was altogether too much. His hand slid up to the handle of his axe. Then he noticed the men were unarmed and he took a deep breath.</p>\r\n<p>"If that''s the way you feel," he began walking back behind the crates. "I''m sure I don''t know why I bothered to try and help. Your kind is all the same."</p>\r\n<p>"Wait, please," cried Tynan, stepping passed Davin with a friendly smile and holding out his hand. "I''m sorry. You caught us a bad time. We''d appreciate any help."</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t need you to apologize for me. If and when I feel it''s needed I''ll do it for myself," Davin dragged Tynan back and hissed angrily in his ear.</p>\r\n<p>"Then do it,” ordered Tynan curtly. "Apart from the fact that he obviously knows something we need to know, do you really want the fellow going home and telling everyone about the rude, overbearing Knight he had the misfortune to meet aboard ship?"</p>\r\n<p>Davin’s cheeks reddened under the rebuke but he knew Tynan was right. He was supposed to be making friends, not antagonists. Squeezing Tynan’s arm, he approached the dwarf.</p>\r\n<p>"My name''s Davin, that''s Tynan &mdash; Knights of the Order of the Dragon. I apologise for my churlish behaviour. Like Tynan said, you caught us at a bad time. Still, that''s no excuse for bad manners. I hope you''ll accept my apology?" he held out his hand. The dwarf looked at it moment. Brown eyes twinkled. </p>\r\n<p>"Pych siq juddatuk bukh grodu Katuk qip?" he answered, taking the hand in a sure grip and pumping it so fiercely, Davin thought his arm was going to drop off.</p>\r\n<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"I said... ''Do either of you men speak Dwarvish?'' And there''s your problem," he added when they looked at each other aghast.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh dear,” groaned Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Damn it,” cursed Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"I take it the answer is no," grinned the dwarf, tugging at his beard.</p>\r\n<p>"This just keeps getting better and better," Davin stormed back to taking his frustrations out on the rail, this time with his forehead. "I knew it! I knew!" He punctuated each thump. He spun around and strode back to join them, granite eyes barely visible through slit lids. "I don''t suppose any of your lot speak Ansukese?" he grated harshly through clenched teeth, storming off below when the dwarf did not reply.</p>\r\n<p>"I''d be happy to act as translator,” the dwarf called after his back.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan heaved a sigh, rubbing the back of his neck as watched Davin disappear below deck. He gazed down at the dwarf. "I have some excellent purple grape in my cabin. I don''t suppose you''d...?"</p>\r\n<p>"Love to!"</p>\r\n<p>"So, what do they call you?" Tynan rested a companionable hand on the dwarfs'' shoulder as they crossed the deck.</p>\r\n<p>"Burtak."</p>\r\n<p>"Well then Burtak," Tynan stepped back to allow the dwarf to precede him down the stairs. "Welcome to the Order of the Dragon!"</p>\r\n<p>The island of Katatuk rose from the pounding, white-foamed waves with intimidating formidability. What had appeared from a distance to be featureless and uninspiring was rather, at close hand, a masterpiece of nature and Dwarvish workmanship that caught the eye and captured the heart.</p>\r\n<p>"Incredible... isn''t it?" breathed Burtak, in the voice of one coming home. </p>\r\n<p>The knights did not reply, enwrapped as they were in the ascetic beauty of the unadorned starkness that owed nothing to anything, save the pure contours of the living rock itself. The same hard, unyielding countenance that looked down upon the city of Qipcha, sprawling along its base, also surrounded and nestled it within an air of safety and security. Qipcha was itself built from stone cut from the mountains that protected it; the subtle blends of grey and black enhancing a sense of belonging and oneness rather than the boredom of uniformity. As soon as the ship docked Burtak left to take the scroll of introduction (that he and Tynan had drawn up over the purple grape) and request an audience of the Conclave, having convinced Sir Davin that it would be a better course of action to remain on board until they received official permission to disembark.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll create a much more favourable impression that way," Burtak advised and since that was all Davin really had at this time, he agreed readily.</p>\r\n<p>While they waited for his return, Davin and Tynan leant against the deck rail watching the familiar scenes of hustle and bustle that were the trademark of all ports everywhere. There were the milling crowds of merchants, tradesmen, the curious and the opportunists, children playing ''run the gangplank'' to see who could get the furthest before they were chased off again by the ships-watch, burly sailors chatting with giggling females or striding in noisy groups towards the nearest bar. Tynan watched with avid fascination as one group of dwarves further along the deck began setting up a strange contraption of ropes, wheels and supports that enabled them to lift the cargo from the hold and swing it out onto the dock, in half the time and with less workforce than the manhandling methods used by the harbour master in Port Canest.</p>\r\n<p>"Now that''s clever," he remarked. "They could sell that idea for a tidy sum on the mainland. I wonder why they haven''t? I''m surprised the ships'' captains haven''t mentioned it either."</p>\r\n<p>"Because the longer it takes to unload the ship, the more it costs," answered Davin with worldly cynicism and obvious disinterest, his attention caught by the sudden commotion around the massive iron gates of the city’s'' defensive wall, where the protesting masses were being shoved aside by six, grim-faced, spear-carrying soldiers. </p>\r\n<p>"Looks like Burtak''s brought a few friends with him," said Tynan facetiously, having turned his head to see what Davin found so interesting.</p>\r\n<p>"They don''t look too friendly to me," replied Davin, a touch of anxiety creeping into his voice at the serious expression on Burtak’s face. </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t start winding yourself up unnecessarily," advised Tynan. "Let''s see what he has to say first. Ho! Burtak," he waved. "We''re over here." </p>\r\n<p>Burtak strode unhurriedly up the gangplank and across the deck under the curious eyes of the now completely motionless port.</p>\r\n<p>"The Conclave have agreed to listen to you," he grinned.</p>\r\n<p>"There, what did we tell you?" Tynan gave Davin a satisfied nod. </p>\r\n<p>"Leave your bags here, someone''s coming from the inn to get them," said Burtak, as they started to gather up their packs. "Bring your bows and wear your swords." </p>\r\n<p>"Is that such a good idea?" asked Davin, looking down at the armed dwarves below.</p>\r\n<p>"A male without a weapon is considered a weakling in Dwarvish society and you won''t be taken seriously without them," he explained.</p>\r\n<p>Seated on the petitioners’ bench in the centre of the Gathering Hall, Davin could see the truth of Burtak’s words. The Conclave consisted of sixty-six dwarves. Six on stone chairs against the back wall and thirty more on benches running the length of the two sidewalls. Every one was conspicuously armed with their chosen weapon resting upon their laps. Unconsciously he fingered the feather on the tip of his bow, grateful for the reassuring weight of his quiver across his back as he surveyed the tight-lipped, suspicions in their eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Those to the side are Clan representatives," explained Burtak. "They''re here to give a wider viewpoint to any issues. Ultimately though the decision will be made by the six Clan leaders, the Katas," he nodded towards the six sitting directly opposite. </p>\r\n<p>Silence fell over the muttering crowd when one of the six, a lean and muscular dwarf with an air of easy authority, rose and, tucking his long-handled axe into the broad belt about his waist, took two paces forward. With legs slightly apart and his hands on his hips, he began to speak. The tone was firm but not unfriendly, though it seemed to Davin that as time went on a note of disappointed impatience began to creep in. However, he put this down to the increasingly long pauses in Burtak’s translating and persevered in his efforts to pay attention despite his growing boredom. Tynan was doing less well and stifling yet another yawn under the guise of wiping his nose, he leant across to Davin behind Burtak’s back.</p>\r\n<p>"How much longer d''you think this going to take?" he whispered out of the corner of his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh!"</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t help it. Just how many heroic deeds is it possible for one person to do... even if he is a Dwarf... when he''s not left this island for a thousand years? I''m all for a good tale but this is ridiculous! My legs are aching, my behind is numb and my stomach is growling so loud they can hear it in Symtar. We''ve been here for ages and we haven''t got a word in yet!"</p>\r\n<p>Davin cut him an irritated glance, then let out an exasperated breath as the speaker strode forward, the angry redness of his face an almost perfect match for his deep-red beard and short-cropped hair. His thumbnail clipped the blade of his axe as he stopped in front of them, his stout chest thrust outwards and his eyes narrowed and challenging as they searched the faces of the three. Tight lipped, he rattled off a short, clipped sentence, pointing from Tynan to himself and then at Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>"First Kata Rhodka wants to know what''s so important that you felt it necessary to so rudely interrupt his flow of words."</p>\r\n<p>"I thought he might," said Davin, turning to scowl at Tynan who flushed guiltily.</p>\r\n<p>Burtak bowed to Rhodka and waving a flourishing hand in Tynan’s direction spoke at some length. Rhodka’s expression remained unchanged and he maintained his fixed gaze and stance, though Davin thought he saw his head shake just before Burtak’s shoulder lifted slightly in a weak shrug. He got the impression there was something going on but he could not decide what it might be.</p>\r\n<p>"What did you say?" he asked Burtak. </p>\r\n<p>"I told him that Tynan was over-awed by the First Kata’s skill and prowess and could not help but observe that the dwarves must be a very mighty race indeed to have such a strong and just a leader," replied Burtak, adding with a hint of amusement, "and that if only Man were so fortunate, they wouldn''t be in the mess they are!"</p>\r\n<p>"You said what,” exclaimed Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"Did he believe it?" asked Tynan desperately holding back his laughter. Davin was already going to scour the floor with him, best not compound his crime.</p>\r\n<p>"No more than you believed his tales," quipped Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>"Whether he believed it or not, is not the point," snapped Davin angrily. "It''s not true."</p>\r\n<p>"Does that matter?" asked Burtak. "It has diffused the situation."</p>\r\n<p>"Of course it matters," Davin growled. "We''re here to make friends. Friendship can''t be struck from falsehood." </p>\r\n<p>He rose slowly to his feet, bowed and held out his hand. Keeping his gaze locked and steady with Rhodka’s, he ordered Burtak to translate his words.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell the First Kata that, though I agree with the sentiments of your explanation, that''s not what Tynan said. Then tell him exactly what Tynan did say. Tell him, I regret and most humbly apologise for Tynan’s rudeness and will not even attempt to make excuses for it. We came to Katatuk to enlist the dwarves aid but I would rather my mission fail than have its success based upon a lie. It would be pleasing if Rhodka would accept my apology and this hand of friendship but I would understand should he reject it, in which case we will leave these islands on the next available ship."</p>\r\n<p>"Are sure about this? It could put you in a very tricky position... there are only two of you. Dwarves can be very... physical... in response to insults," warned Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ll cross that bridge if and when we come to it, though I''m hoping we won''t have to," replied Davin keeping his voice calm and his body tensed and ready for action. "Tell him."</p>\r\n<p>"That won''t be necessary."</p>\r\n<p>To the knights'' utter amazement, Rhodka answered in perfect Ansukese as he took Davin’s hand in a firm shake.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s going on?" Both Davin and Tynan glared accusingly from Bartok to Rhodka and back. "You... "</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka lifted his hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t blame Burtak. He was only following orders. He overheard you talking in Port Canest and sent word. We decided to put you through a little test. So we could, how do you say it... ...measure your worth?"</p>\r\n<p>"Did we pass?" Asked Davin, dampening his anger. The dwarves had every right to be careful.</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka looked at him long and hard but did not answer, turning instead to Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell me, would you have spoken so freely if you''d known I could understand you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Probably not," admitted Tynan, shame-faced but without hesitation.</p>\r\n<p>"Patience and honesty. Not traits we come by often in your race. Come, let''s eat."</p>\r\n<p>Davin gazed around the rapidly emptying room with confusion.</p>\r\n<p>"What about the meeting?" </p>\r\n<p>"It''s just about to start," replied Burtak with a grin. "This was merely a prelude. All serious talking is done over the table... Dwarves think better on a full stomach."</p>\r\n<p>"People after my own heart," agreed Tynan, pushing Davin on his way. "By the way, how did you manage to get a message from Port Canest?"</p>\r\n<p>Burtak put his fingers to his lips. A handsome hawk answered his shrill whistle, flying in through one of the open windows and alighting on his raised forearm.</p>\r\n<p>"Meet Mirka." Burtak introduced them to the hawk. Mirka cocked her head; intelligent, deep, brown eyes regarded the two men. She ruffled her feathers and gazed back at Burtak. </p>\r\n<p>"Aren''t you afraid she''ll fly off?" </p>\r\n<p>"It''s her choice to make," Burtak shrugged, raising his arm and sending Mirka aloft as they left the room. "She''s not a captive, she''s a friend." </p>\r\n<p>The supper hall was at least twice the size of the Gathering hall and that had been big.&nbsp;Overhead, four enormous wheels hung on chains from the ceiling, with candles set into the rims that (though not presently lit) would supply ample lighting throughout the hall.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s another novel idea. We really could learn a lot from these dwarves," Tynan observed, eyeing the contraptions with great interest, until the mouth-watering aromas drifting beneath his nostrils set his stomach to growling again and he began moving towards the three, long, stone tables that ran halfway down the length of the room. The windows behind the tables gave a full view of the harbour and the Straits of Dorda beyond, where the waves were cresting high, white tips lost in the falling snow.</p>\r\n<p>"Wasn''t the sun shining when we came in?" Tynan frowned towards the windows.</p>\r\n<p>"They certainly have some strange weather here," Davin agreed.</p>\r\n<p>"This isn''t normal." Burtak’s voice was filled with bewilderment as he too, frowned at the view. Davin and Tynan looked at each other with concern. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly there was a clanging and crashing from the far end of the room where a whole pig was being turned slowly in a massive fireplace, dripping its spitting juices over the hot coals. On either side of the fireplace were two enormous stoves. Two females wearing aprons were bustling before them, checking steaming pans and stirring bubbling pots. Another, red-faced with embarrassment, was busy mopping soup off the floor around one of the tables standing in front of the stoves, accompanied by the sharp eyes and scalding tongues of the two. Each table was laden with a variety of foodstuff: vegetables, fruits and pastries either waiting their turn in the oven or having just come out. Younger females hurried back and forth through a side door setting the tables with cutlery, plates, mugs and jugs of foaming beer. Rhodka beckoned the two knights to be seated, filled their mugs and raised his own.</p>\r\n<p>"Habak brüjh! Good eating,” he cried.</p>\r\n<p>The other sixty-five members of the Conclave echoed his toast and downed their beer in one, slamming their empty mugs onto the table and almost immediately, the females brought forward the food. Rhodka filled and emptied his plate before turning to Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"No doubt you''ve heard that we''re an insular and taciturn race. Most translate this as uncaring, selfish and suspicious. But we prefer to think of ourselves as cautious and judicious. It''s a way that''s stood us in good stead for centuries. We''ve lived peaceably, disturbing no-one and being disturbed by no-one." </p>\r\n<p>He stopped to re-fill his plate with thick slices of succulent pork, a baked apple, Rosen berries (a type of plum) stuffed with mushrooms and creamy, mashed cabbage, urging Davin to do likewise. Davin helped himself to a small portion, for politeness'' sake, though his appetite was no more than a twinge in the rising indigestion pushed upwards by his sinking heart. Rhodka’s opening speech did not bode well.</p>\r\n<p>"We already know why you''re here, so let''s get straight down to the questions. Duman defeated the Dragons easily after the Hurian War, why should we believe Man can do any better?" Rhodka piled his fork and emptied it into his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman didn''t battle the Dragons, he tricked them with lies that played upon their trust and desire to get home," answered Davin. "Though it isn''t to our credit, Man is well versed in lies and deceit... it''s part of our nature...and because of this Duman won''t find us so easy to manipulate. Also, we have the Power of Ecos with us."</p>\r\n<p>"Ah, yes, this Powerwielder, again I ask, if Ecos were no match for Duman then, what makes you think he is now, even with Man’s help?" insisted Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>Davin deliberately took a bite of pork, chewing slowly to give himself time to think while he ran through everything Alyse and Cymon had told them, seeking a plausible answer. When he had one, he swallowed.</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos discovered Duman’s treachery too late. He could''ve tried to stand up to Duman but he was faced with the dilemma of not knowing how to release his brothers... should Duman’s death not suffice. And not only his brothers," he added quickly, "but the lives of the other four Heroes was also at stake... one of them a Dwarf," he added for good measure.</p>\r\n<p>"We know our history,” a voice cried out.</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos took the only course left open... to keep his Power from Duman and leave hope for the future." Using the excuse of reaching for the beer jug, Davin cast a surreptitious glance at Tynan who mouthed a ''well said'', while Burtak nodded encouragingly. Buoyed by their support, he allowed himself to relax a little. Despite the surly aside from the other table, he began to feel he had made a good start, he only hoped he could keep it up. </p>\r\n<p>"Has Man discovered the secret to releasing the Dragons then?" Again, the question came from the table behind him. </p>\r\n<p>"No," he turned in his seat and answered truthfully, then quickly swung back to explain further to Rhodka. "But we won''t be part of that anyway. Our task is to fight Duman’s army."</p>\r\n<p>"This Powerwielder then, she has the knowledge?" another dwarf, this time on his own table, refused to let the matter drop. Davin did not fail to notice the sly nudge the dwarf gave his neighbour when he hesitated. </p>\r\n<p>"Possibly." </p>\r\n<p>"Possibly?" mocked the dwarf. "It''s either yes or no, surely?"</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka came to his rescue by inviting him to try a new dish being served, insisting it was delicious. Davin gave him a grateful glance as he took a bite of the tomato filled with crispy-fried flaked carrot. He chewed slowly and thought quickly.</p>\r\n<p>"I''d like to say ''yes'' but I can''t," he finally answered, unable to ignore the dwarfs'' derisive sneer any longer and was drowned out by angry shouting and jeering guffaws. </p>\r\n<p>"Cruwj nahgè jûdd volx grdu,” bellowed Rhodka jumping to his feet. "Uskba juddatuk zek''grodu Bhytiq!" He pulled out his axe and laid it in front of his plate. The noise level lowered but was not silenced. Davin looked to Burtak for translation but aside from a swift, sideways glance he kept his face fixed straight ahead. Obviously this was something Davin had to work out for himself, and equally obvious, much hinged on him doing so. His gaze swept over the gathering, coming to rest on Rhodka, stiff and proud at the head of the table and at his axe, a hands'' reach before him.</p>\r\n<p>''A male without a weapon is considered a weakling...&nbsp;Dwarves can be very physical in response to insults.'' </p>\r\n<p>Burtak’s words flashed in his mind and his eyes hardened as he pushed back his chair. Casting a scathing glance over those before him, he reached for his bow and with slow deliberation, laid it along the middle of the table. There was a ripple of approval and at last, silence. Rhodka (and many of the others within his fixed frame of sight) looked at him with renewed respect and tipped his mug. Davin nodded, picked up his own mug and took a long swallow to steady his nerves.</p>\r\n<p>"To finish answering the question. I can''t say ''yes''... but neither can I say ''no''... the Powerwielder didn''t tell us."</p>\r\n<p>"Didn''t anyone think to ask?" cried a contemptuous voice.</p>\r\n<p>"That would give them credit for brains,” laughed another.</p>\r\n<p>Davin recalled the frightening vision that had stood before him and his knights, the awesome anger of the Dragon, Ecos. The molten gaze that burnt straight into the heart, the horrifying scenes of the future that filled their minds. Davin shook his head to clear his thoughts as the impatient murmurings along the table intruded.</p>\r\n<p>"No-one would have dared at the time... not even the bravest of you. And afterwards, it didn''t matter. She had given us our tasks to do and left upon her own. It wasn''t for us to question her plans...&nbsp;any more than you would expect one of your soldiers to question an order from their Kata," he added scornfully.</p>\r\n<p>"A valid point," agreed Rhodka over the grumbling murmurs. "But give us a reason, Sir Davin, why the Dwarves should come to the aid of Man." </p>\r\n<p>Davin sat down. With a long, drawn out sigh, he placed his elbows on the table and, resting his mouth upon his clasped hands, closed his eyes as he struggled to find a way to avoid admitting that he did not know. He turned his head and lifted his lids to glance at Tynan with a look of hopelessness. </p>\r\n<p>"Just speak your heart," Tynan advised.</p>\r\n<p>Davin took a deep breath and got to his feet. He stepped into the space between the two tables, so that he could address the whole room. Grey eyes were as soft as shadows, as he gazed about the room. Then, lifting his hands in an open shrug of resignation, he began honestly.</p>\r\n<p>"First Kata... members of the Dwarven Conclave. No one was more surprised than me... or more dismayed...&nbsp;when Ecos placed this task on my shoulders. I’m not an ambassador. I''m a soldier. I have no great education or public skills, just a strong arm and good eye. Indeed, as Burtak will testify, after weeks of desperate mind wracking the best speech I could come up with was...&nbsp;''Grab your weapons, you''re going to war!''"</p>\r\n<p>There was a ripple of amusement. Encouraged by this, for Davin had expected rather a roar of derision, his tongue loosened itself from the top of his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Not very much, or very persuasive but in truth... that''s the nub of it. The world is at war, if not right at this minute at least in the very near future. Where it will end, I don''t know but I know where it will begin: in Rohansuk. Only Fate knows what this war will hold in store for those who fight it. This though, I do know...&nbsp;Man cannot stand-alone and if we try, we will inevitably lose. Ecos has shown us the horrors that wait under Duman’s domain, and not just for Rohansuk. When Duman is done there, he will turn to the rest. Oh, you may be safe for a while, it''s only logical that his arm will reach to S''yûmerra and Fellamund first...&nbsp;but rest assured, your turn will come. Anything that doesn''t bear his mark, even to the last blade of grass will be annihilated. This is why we''ve come here: to ask you to unite with us, as you did before, and fight this common enemy &mdash; not just for Man, but for Dwarf, Soyex and Fellis, for all the Mother’s children, and not just for ourselves, but also for our children and our children’s'' children, for the future of all. As I said, alone Man must surely fail... but we will fight anyway, for we too are stubborn and intractable in some matters... and our freedom is one of them! We won''t just lie down and die. We''ll carry on till the bitter end, though our doom be written and sealed before the first arrow flies. But together,” he slammed his fist into his palm. "Together, we have a chance! Think of it: all the Races under one banner. How could we fail?" he asked stretching out his arms to encompass the entire room. Davin’s impassioned speech stirred his blood, lighting his face with a radiance that reminded Tynan of Alyse as, inside his sleeve, the Dragonmark throbbed in response. Never had Tynan been so proud to be Davin’s friend as at that moment. The dwarves however appeared less impressed and seemed not to hear the plea for survival he had so eloquently expressed.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman''s not our enemy," shouted one.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ve done nothing to him," cried another. </p>\r\n<p>"... Why should he bother with us?" added the one next to him.</p>\r\n<p>And so it followed around the tables until had had enough. He put his fingers to his lips and gave a shrill whistle as he pushed himself to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you all deaf?" he shouted back at them all with scornful disbelief. "The man has just told you why." </p>\r\n<p>"I must have missed it,” someone sniggered.</p>\r\n<p>Davin eased Tynan back into his seat with a gentle pressure on his shoulder and a grateful smile for his defence. Then he lifted his eyes to look down the table, struggling to control his temper in the face of boorish ill manners, for the majority of the dwarves had already dismissed their attention back to the food upon their plates. Davin smashed his fist on the table so that the contents jumped and rattled. An angry curse upon whoever was responsible for his spilt ale was cut off as Davin pierced the speaker with a granite glare shot through with steel. </p>\r\n<p>"Duman needs no reasons for anything. His whim and fancy suffice. He may not be your enemy now but when the rest of us are gone, who then will come to your aid when you stand alone?"</p>\r\n<p>"We don''t need anyone’s aid! Katatuk isn''t just a string of islands. They are strong fortresses with many hidden defences. We can hold them against Duman’s minions... and anybody else that thinks to come calling," sneered an arrogant tone.</p>\r\n<p>It was one of the Six and he fixed Davin with a look of open hostility and hatred. Davin glanced quickly at Burtak for identification.</p>\r\n<p>"Fourth Kata Annuk, of the Clan Fishers," Burtak whispered. "He doesn''t like Man very much."</p>\r\n<p>"I would never have guessed,” quipped Tynan sarcastically, raising his mug to Annuk. Beside him, Tynan could hear Davin’s teeth grinding at the deliberately provocative gesture but he refused to look ashamed and curled the corners of his mouth in a smile of total insincerity. Unable to do anything else, Davin made do with the satisfaction of seeing Tynan wince as he kicked his ankle under the table. He turned a curious gaze upon the Fourth Kata.</p>\r\n<p>"For how long?" he asked mildly.</p>\r\n<p>"What?" Said the dwarf rudely. </p>\r\n<p>Again Davin struggled with his self-control at having been so impolitely dismissed once more. But he kept his mask fixed and repeated his question calmly.</p>\r\n<p>"How long can you hold Katatuk?" </p>\r\n<p>"For as long as need be," answered Annuk, returning the cheers of his fellow countrymen with a raised mug. </p>\r\n<p>"Forever?" </p>\r\n<p>Davin allowed the question to fall softly so that only those closest to him could hear. Their silence washed gradually around the gathering, like gentle waves upon the shore, as the word was passed around. </p>\r\n<p>"Forever?" Davin asked louder. No one offered a response and now it was his turn to sneer, and he held nothing back as he let his contempt fall upon Annuk. "That''s how long you''re going to have to hold for. Maybe you have the defences, I''ll take your word for it. I''m told your people are skilled soldiers and possess great courage. But... do you have the resources to withstand, forever? The ship we came over on was loaded with foodstuffs and trade goods. When these supplies run out... when the avenues of trade disappear... how will you keep warm... what will you eat?" He stared pointedly at the blazing fire, the heavily laden tables and their round bellies, then sat down and picked up his fork while they thought about it. </p>\r\n<p>"That got their attention," whispered Tynan. "Look at their faces."</p>\r\n<p>Davin eyed the room as he began eating. Every one of the dwarves was huddled in conversation, their brows lined and thoughtful, their eyes filled with anxious doubts. Only Rhodka seemed to remain impassive, leaning back in his chair, mug in hand. Davin dared to allow himself a small taste of victory. </p>\r\n<p>Annuk was not done yet, however.</p>\r\n<p>"We listened to Man once before and look what happened," he shouted down the table in bitter tones. The gathering ceased their conversations. A hardness falling over their features once more as a unified cry of ''Aye'' almost deafened the knights with its vehemence. Davin frowned.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know what you''re talking about." </p>\r\n<p>"Hah,” cried Annuk, now clearly playing to his audience. "Typical Man! How easily they forget their promises and their wrongdoings!"</p>\r\n<p>Davin might have been in the dark but the dwarves clearly were not and he could tell by their expressions that Annuk’s passion was having its desired effect and that he was rapidly losing what little ground he may have gained. His fist curled in frustration and once again he turned to Burtak for enlightenment. </p>\r\n<p>"With your permission, First Kata?" Burtak looked to the head of the table first. Rhodka nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"Before the Hurian Wars," Burtak explained to Davin, "Man gave us a number of promises in exchange for our help. As far as Annuk and the Clan Fishers are concerned, one of the promises given was the right to fish in what is now known as the Bay of Respite. Afterwards however, when we attempted to do so, our boats were attacked and burned, and more than this. Man, with its expanding population overflowed into Kataphel, as our homeland was called then, which once ran from Tacha Mund; the Borinian Heights; down through what you now call the Westbrookes and Provinces and the Great</p>\r\n<p>Plain. In fact, in those days, Ansuks'' southern border ran along the Sarwater, continuing straight to the western border when the Sarwater turns sharply south. It was not much bigger than Middle Province is today. Anyway, it wasn''t enough and one by one, Dwarven families were ousted off their land until the last took ship and came here... to make a new homeland in Katatuk," explained Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>"Now that''s not written in the history books,” exclaimed Tynan in surprise.</p>\r\n<p>"Typical Man,” repeated Annuk. "First pretends he didn''t know, then pretends it didn’t'' happen!"</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka silenced the shouted jeers, banging fists and stomping feet.</p>\r\n<p>"You really didn''t know about this, did you?" he asked, convinced by the sincerity of Tynan’s tone and the sheer disgust for their fellow Man written on both their faces.</p>\r\n<p>"No, we didn''t. And I know I speak for Tynan too when I say we are shamed by it," replied Davin, turning to address them all and was rewarded by seeing some of the faces soften. It had not passed them by that he omitted saying: ''if such a thing happened''. One or two glanced questioningly at Rhodka. </p>\r\n<p>"You are accepting that Annuk speaks the truth, even though you claim your own history has wiped these deeds from its memory?" he asked Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"The Fourth Kata has no reason to lie," answered Davin without hesitation. A ripple of approval went round the room.</p>\r\n<p>"He''s sweet talking you," Annuk rounded on his fellow dwarves immediately. "You fall for it and the same thing will happen all over again."</p>\r\n<p>"No! It won''t," snapped Davin tersely, jumping to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"How can you be sure? D''you think our islands not good enough for your race?" </p>\r\n<p>In view of what he had just learnt, Davin could not blame Annuk for his doubting and contemptuous tone. An image flashed in his mind of Mirka, the falcon. </p>\r\n<p>"Because this time I''m making no promises. I''m asking help for free. No lures. No enticements. No strings on either side," his eyes slid from table to table with each statement. His gaze stopped at Burtak, to whom he nodded, acknowledging his help in advance, knowing that the dwarf would recognise his own words "You either help or don''t help. It''s your choice." His flat, expressionless gaze swept the room once more and then he resumed his seat and his meal. He was halfway through his fruit and cheese before anyone spoke directly to him again. Strangely, it was not Rhodka but the white-haired dwarf opposite who posed the question.</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s say we should agree to help. Who else stands with you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Bhulef," said Burtak quietly.</p>\r\n<p>"Granted," answered Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s the Third Kata’s name. Bhulef, of the Chroniclers," explained Burtak hiding his grin as he nodded respectfully to old dwarf. "He''s not actually a member of the Conclave anymore but it was voted to allow him to take Mawbek’s place as this was too important to wait for his return. Mawbek is Kata of the Clan Chroniclers. He''s away on business."</p>\r\n<p>At the head of the table Rhodka’s eyes gave the barest of flickers in Bhulefs'' direction as he waited for Davin to answer but Davin spotted it. He wouldn''t have been surprised to learn he had prompted the old dwarf to speak. Why, Davin wondered, did Rhodka not ask himself? He kept his expression bland however, raising his hand for indulgence as he took a drink to wash down his cheese, when Bhulef asked his question again.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re the first we''ve approached," Davin told him, "though we do have a pledge from the Elfin."</p>\r\n<p>There was more than one snort of derisive disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>"The Elfin wouldn''t even leave Phelise to help their own, ask the A''mathan!" </p>\r\n<p>"More like you asked and they sent you off with a flea in your ear!"</p>\r\n<p>"That''s if they ever let you into Phelise...&nbsp;...assuming you could ever find it!"</p>\r\n<p>"On the contrary," retorted Tynan smugly, over the noisy laughter. "We''ve got proof of their pledge. Show them the medallion Davin," he elbowed Davin in the ribs. Davin drew Cymon’s medallion over his head and handed it to Bhulef, who examined it thoroughly. </p>\r\n<p>"The Rùyi Sh''œrè is authentic," he confirmed as he passed it up the table to Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>"They could''ve stolen it," cried the dwarf at the end of the table opposite, his eyes raking the knights, not for the first time, with dislike.</p>\r\n<p>"I said you''d say that!" Tynan slapped his palm hard on the table. "Didn''t I tell Cymon they''d accuse us of stealing it?" Tynan reminded Davin, snatching up his mug so sharply he splashed ale down the front of his shirt. </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t be so ridiculous Veskai," Bhulefs'' rebuke washed loudly over Tynan’s angry aside.&nbsp;"When was the last time you ever heard of an elf showing himself openly outside of Phelise? And no elf would part with his Rùyi Sh''œrè except under extraordinary circumstances. They are kept safely hidden at all times."</p>\r\n<p>"Concealed by an illusion," agreed Davin, just to show he knew something about the</p>\r\n<p>Elfin.</p>\r\n<p>"Unless the elf was dead," insisted Veskai, ignoring Davin completely. "Perhaps they killed him!"</p>\r\n<p>"Though I''m sure these knights are skilled soldiers, there''s no way... no disrespect," Bhulef nodded apologetically in their direction, "that they would be capable of such a deed."</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t know that,” cried Veskai.</p>\r\n<p>"We certainly wouldn''t do such a thing," stated Tynan in their defence, totally misunderstanding Bhulefs'' meaning, and turned puzzled eyed to Burtak at the resulting shouts of laughter and numerous derisive jokes aimed equally at Veskai and themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Fuming with rage that his argument had backfired on him, leaving him to share the butt of mocking ridicule rather than casting the knights in a bad light, Veskais'' hand moved instinctively to the sword at his waist. He stopped it before it arrived. There were too many to demand satisfaction and the two men against whom his anger really centred had done nothing to warrant any such challenge. Though it was none of their doing, Veskais'' glare upon the knights darkened as he pushed his plate across the table and rose.</p>\r\n<p>"Well? Are you going to let us in on it or not?" Tynan asked Burtak irritably as Veskai stomped his way to the door.</p>\r\n<p>"Only the Elite are permitted to leave Phelise," explained Burtak pulling his mouth straight under Tynan’s glare. "Ten men against an Elite may have stood a chance but just the two of you," he shook his head. "I''m sorry. It''s just too funny to even think about!"</p>\r\n<p>Davin jumped to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Veskai!" he shouted. "Please, rejoin us. You could''ve been right. When we met up with Cymon there were fifty men in my company."</p>\r\n<p>All eyes turned to Davin with surprise, except those of Veskai that narrowed suspiciously.</p>\r\n<p>"Why would you admit to this?" he asked, his face hardening. "You''ve placed yourselves under suspicion of murder. If you''re trying to butter me up into being an ally, you''re wasting your time. As far as I''m concerned Man can still go to the Depths and we''ll look after our own!"</p>\r\n<p>"Fair enough," returned Davin waving towards Veskais'' empty chair. "Please, sit anyway."</p>\r\n<p>Veskai hesitated in the doorway undecided, then shrugged. He still hadn''t finished his supper.</p>\r\n<p>"This doesn''t change anything," he growled as he returned to the table.</p>\r\n<p>Davin held back his smile, moving his attention to Rhodka instead, He had the feeling the First Kata knew exactly what he was thinking and was sure he saw him give a slight nod of approval. It was time these Dwarves learnt some Knightly manners!</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon was alive and well last we saw him... you have my word as a Knight on this," he paused to stare pointedly around the room. "Sometimes," he began firmly, "it''s wise to ascertain the facts before resorting to mockery. As it turned out Veskai made a valid point and has been sorely wronged. I think he deserves an apology." One eyebrow rose expectantly.</p>\r\n<p>It was too much for many in the room: their dislike and mistrust of Man given credence in their eyes by this knights'' audacity in trying to tell them what to do in their own Conclave. Bursts of outrage bounced off the walls and ceiling, as the Clan representatives demanded the Six do something about these infidels.</p>\r\n<p>"By Tacha’s hammer, they''re right," exclaimed one and motioned that proceedings be terminated immediately and that Davin and Tynan be expelled from the hall with a definite refusal. Annuk went one better and demanded they be expelled from Katatuk itself.</p>\r\n<p>"But Annuk, there are no ships in the harbour," observed Bhulef softly, trying to calm the situation.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I say we throw them into the sea,” cried Annuk to cheering applause.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh dear," muttered Bhulef and gave up.</p>\r\n<p>"This is getting ugly," whispered Tynan in the sight of the shaking fists. </p>\r\n<p>More than half the dwarves were already on their feet, eyes dark with anger in faces contorted with the high emotions of the mob. Of the few that remained aloof, Veskai sat still confused by the knights'' defence, while Rhodka leaned back in his chair and rubbed his belly, clearly amused. Davin turned his head to the deliberate sound of a scraping chair at the other end of the table. A large, solidly stocky dwarf stood like a bull preparing to charge, the analogy reinforced by the flaring nostrils and the furry, horned helmet on his head. There was no mistaking the hate in his bloodshot eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Skortaag. Miners," Burtak answered Tynan’s inquisitive glance softly. </p>\r\n<p>"Chaknughe drwysin virdug phlyx rabta,” spat Skortaag, puffing out his chest as he tugged fiercely upon his curly, black beard before hoisting his trousers. Davin looked down at Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t want to know," Burtak shook his head. </p>\r\n<p>That, and Burtak’s flaming cheeks, was translation enough for Davin and he reached for his bow. A sneer twisted the dwarfs'' lips as his hand found his axe. But before he could clear it from his belt, there was a ''twang'' and a rattling thud. Before him, a quivering arrow impaled his plate to the table. When he looked back up at Davin, another arrow was already notched and waiting, and pointing at his chest!</p>\r\n<p>"That was a warning shot," Davin’s voice was hard and threatening. "The next one won''t be! I don''t know what you said... and my friend here assures me I don''t want to... but you will retract your words."</p>\r\n<p>Skortaags'' dilemma was plain. Lose face... or lose his life. He scanned the room for support but all he found was avid curiosity. Even Fourth Kata Annuk, into whose allegiance he had thrown his lot over the knights’ proposal, refused to catch his eye or rise in his defence. His shoulders slumped. He was not prepared to die over such a triviality as a Man. He lowered his eyes so that he would not see the looks of scorn and contempt from his neighbours and pushed his axe back into his belt. From somewhere in his great beard he muttered an apology. </p>\r\n<p>"That''s one," said Davin curtly. "Now the rest of you."</p>\r\n<p>"You can''t shoot us all." Annuk’s contemptuous sneer echoed Davin’s own thought and, quite neatly, provided his answer.</p>\r\n<p>"No," replied Davin, his mouth twisting at one corner with a smile of pleasurable anticipation that was not lost on the Fourth Kata as the knight swung his arrow towards him. "But I can shoot you!"</p>\r\n<p>"And I''m sure I can make for one or two others," added Tynan, who was now standing beside Davin, his own bow ready and waiting. Annuk’s face went white. The rest gazed anxiously at Tynan wondering upon whom the swinging arrow would stop.</p>\r\n<p>"Now, shall you tell them to apologise or shall my little friend here do it for you?" Davin waggled the arrow a little, just for effect. He just hoped Annuk would not call his bluff. He could tell by Burtak’s expression that he had furthered his cause no end with this show of force and if he had to back down now... </p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, Annuk was not calm or astute enough, to see past Davin’s ruse or the mask of indifference as to Annuk’s future health that Davin plastered upon his face. The atmosphere was thick with tension, apprehension and anticipation... depending on the individual. Later, Tynan went so far as to remark that he was certain that there were one or two... Rhodka not excluded... that were almost gleeful at the prospect of Annuk sporting the latest fashion in arrow accessories! At the present, Annuk wiped his sweaty palms down the legs of his baggy trousers. He was shaking and leant against the edge of the table for support for... like Skortaag... a quick glance around the table told him he would find no other.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s possible... that is... there were more of... Urkha curse you,” he spat. "Veskai deserves an apology." He jerked his head around to stare down at Rhodka, the animosity between the two now plain. "I won''t forget this Rhodka. My vote is against." And then he was gone and eight of his most ardent supporters with him, each shooting hostile glances at the two knights as they passed. Surprisingly, Skortaag was not one of them, neither was</p>\r\n<p>Veskai. Davin felt a ray of hope that these dwarves were not as close-minded as he feared... a ray that was to be severely dimmed, as Rhodka quickly got back to business before any could motion the meeting void.</p>\r\n<p>"Was this ''Cymon'' an Elder?" </p>\r\n<p>The question was to be expected but the hopeful gleam in Rhodka’s eyes was not and Davin realised that the Kata was letting him know that the absentees were not the only ones who had already cast a negative vote, while at the same time throwing him a lifeline that would keep his mission from drowning beneath a sea of refusals if he could. All Davin had to do was tell a little lie. Not even that really because for all he knew, Cymon could be one of the Elders... he had never said he wasn''t. He opened his mouth. </p>\r\n<p>''Thy tongue hath never known the taste of falsehood.''</p>\r\n<p>The Dragon’s words came back to haunt him and his shoulders sagged. He gathered his resignation in a deep sigh as he was forced to admit that he didn''t think so. That he was an Elite sent to fetch the Powerwielder to Phelise. He watched the light go out in Rhodka’s eyes to be replaced by a look of sadness as he held out the Rùyi Sh''œrè for Davin to take. </p>\r\n<p>"Then unless any here wish to re-cast their votes, I have to tell you that... "</p>\r\n<p>"Wait!" The cry came from Veskai. "I propose that the final decision is not given based on this revelation. It''s quite possible the Elders may bow to this Powerwielder; therefore such a basis is invalid. Plus, I say the knight deserves a chance on the basis of his truthfulness. Three times now he has proven his honesty and his honour, regardless of the damage to his cause. I say, we respect that honour and are in turn, honour bound to give him more time."</p>\r\n<p>Mixed cries of disapproval and denial drowned the murmurs of assent as Rhodka stared at Veskai with undisguised surprise. When Burtak had first come to them off the ship, Veskai had physically opposed the notion of even allowing audience to the two men, snatching the scroll from Burtak’s hands and shredding it into tiny pieces. His people were slow to change in lifestyle or opinions, a product perhaps of their long lifespan, so it was inconceivable to Rhodka that Veskai should be capable of such an abrupt about-face. </p>\r\n<p>Could this be some kind of ruse &mdash; one that might well be detrimental, to the knight’s hopes or even health? </p>\r\n<p>Was he trying to keep them here longer in the hope that a similar confrontation to the one they had just witnessed may not go so favourably for the knights? </p>\r\n<p>Could Veskai be working on behalf of Annuk? </p>\r\n<p>Though the two had never openly sided together, Veskai had nevertheless always been a staunch opposer of all things un-Dwarvish. He had been a continual thorn in Rhodka’s side every time the First Kata had tried to implement changes over the years. Rhodka was extremely unsettled by the suddenly unprecedented notion of having Veskai as an ally. </p>\r\n<p>Veskai was equally unsettled. His motive for speaking up had been his acute discomfort at feeling indebted to Davin and a sense that it was his duty, as a matter of honour, to return the gesture. At least that was what he told himself, for the mutinous thought that he might actually like and admire these two men left a bad taste in his mouth and a roil of confusion in his heart. For he was forced to acknowledge to himself that having placed these strangers; their worth and their values; against Annuk and others of his kind, his own people had come away sadly wanting. </p>\r\n<p>"Does anyone second?" Rhodka’s voice finally cut through the babble of dissent.</p>\r\n<p>"Er... yes. Yes, I do," Bhulef suddenly jumped in his seat after uncomfortably long pause and raised his hand aloft. Rhodka turned to Davin and Tynan. </p>\r\n<p>"There''s a ship due in two days. You have till then to convince the Conclave to agree to your petition. I will place a guard at your disposal to take to you to their various homes."&nbsp;Which should put paid to any schemes Veskai or Annuk might be hatching, he thought to himself. "I wish you good luck... and good night." He rose and left the table. The room began to clear.</p>\r\n<p>"Damn,” cried Davin, crashing his fist upon the table for punctuation, once he and Tynan were alone. "Damn! Damn! Damn!"</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t be so hard on yourself," chided Tynan, pouring a mug of ale and pushing it towards him. "Drink up, it''ll make you feel better."</p>\r\n<p>"You think ale makes everything better," scowled Davin but he took the mug and drank it down in one swallow. </p>\r\n<p>"It could be worse... Well, it could!" Tynan insisted as Davin scowled at him. He refilled his mug. "Drink...then you think. Rhodka all but admitted the decision was already made before we got here. At least you won a reprieve, so it''s not a total loss yet. You''ve got two more days. One on one, they might be easier to persuade...&nbsp;like Veskai and that other one...&nbsp;Whats-his-name?"</p>\r\n<p>"Skortaag."</p>\r\n<p>"Granted," said Tynan and managed to tweak a grin from the corner of Davin’s mouth. "And there''s still the Dragonmarks." he continued, pushing up his sleeve. "By the way, why didn''t you show them?"</p>\r\n<p>"Truthfully? I forgot! I was so nervous to start with. It was all I could do to think of answers to their questions. Then I decided there was little point."</p>\r\n<p>"Why?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because I didn''t think it would make any difference. We can''t waste it just on a demonstration and it seemed, the mood they were in, that unless we could show them what it''s capable of they would''ve seen no more than a tattoo."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re probably right. Cymon’s Rugi... Ruyi... thingy...&nbsp;didn''t make much of an impression did it?"</p>\r\n<p>"Well, it got us those two days," reminded Davin taking his turn at encouraging.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s true. And talking of which, though it goes against all my principles to leave while the jug''s still sloshing, we''re going to need clear heads and bright minds if we''re to make any progress. Let''s get back to inn. Early to bed...&nbsp;early to rise and all that." He yawned and stretched his arms. The Dragonmark glinted gold in the candlelight as they twisted over his head. From the end of the table came a mighty crash. "That woman really is very clumsy," he whispered to Davin, who gave her a sympathetic smile as she hastily gathered the broken pieces of pottery onto the dropped tray.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s probably tired too. You know, I think Rhodka is on our side so we needn''t bother with him tomorrow... or Bhulef. We''ll go see Veskai first. I''ve got a feeling about that one," said Davin thoughtfully as they stepped out into the night. </p>\r\n</div>', 1, 21, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

How anyone could possibly refer to this loathsome landscape as home was beyond his reasoning...&nbsp;even the bog rats, the lowest class of his family, would not deign to inhabit such unwholesome terrain. So depressed was he, that even the company of those of his brothers who had accompanied him failed to lift his spirits and it was in this low state of mind that the runner from the fortress reached him.<p></p>\r\n<p>On hearing what the runner had to report, the growing ball of rebellion rose within him, perhaps gaining momentum because of his mental and physical discomfort. Sick and tired of the impotent frustrations of years of doing nothing but swallowing pride and pain while he waited for the outside world to make the first move, he had sent the runner back with the message to get word to those of their family that lived around the village of Willoway, on the banks of the Westbrooke River. He urged his cousins, the water rats that colonized the river in large communities, to converge upon the village and once there to watch and protect all those against whom Duman’s hand was raised. Kretos agreed with his brother that their cousins would find the idea of defending those whose race had for aeons persecuted them, offensive and extremely difficult to accept but he reasoned that better their persecutors be those of a lesser intelligence, than it be Duman. At least Man and his kind tended to ignore what did not bother them. Duman however, would send his minions to actively seek them out and eradicate all to the very last.</p>\r\n<p>He had no worries that whatever their objections, in the end, his cousins would band with him. Despite their various differences, they were all members of a single extended family and could, when all was said and done, rely on each other. Now, two days later, as he stared at the glowing lights of the Gracht campfires, Kretos had a fleeting wish that for once it would not be so as he suddenly realised exactly what he had set in motion and wondered whether he should live long enough upon his return to Ak''thai to regret his impulsive decision.</p>\r\n<p>Picking up the fastest of his companions, he sent him back with instructions to double the watch everywhere. They were to let him know immediately if Duman received any information or revealed any suspicions regarding Kretos himself. His brother rat nodded and sped back to Ak''thai. Kretos watched him go, filled with anxiety. Despite these precautions, for the first time in his life he was going to have to rely on luck...&nbsp;and it scared him. His knees felt weak and his legs began to shake. Anxiety dried his mouth and he took a drink from his water-skin, rolling the liquid over his tongue and spitting the taste of fear onto the ground before swallowing some to relieve his tickling throat.</p>\r\n<p>"Show yourself or die,” a harsh voice demanded from the camp as he was replacing the skin onto his belt. Pushing his true identity back inside the guise of ''Kretos the cringing minion'', he stepped into the camp.</p>\r\n<p>"Great G''narch,” he whined. "I bring orders from our master, the Mighty Duman."</p>\r\n<p>"Then step forward, snivelling wretch and give thanks to him for your life," replied the empty, black-pitched tones of the Grachtan general.</p>\r\n<p>Much later, Kretos still found himself sitting on the wet log and held in place by the strong grip of the grachtan soldier seated next to him. The damp, drizzly night air seeped into his bones making them ache, adding to his overall misery. He did not think he could feel any worse until someone shoved a plate of wriggling slug worms into his hands. His stomach heaved at the sight of their fat, squirming bodies and then again as the smell of them assaulted his nostrils. Turning to his neighbour he began to politely refuse, but ended up holding his breath instead as the stench from the open, leering mouth breathed into his face, intensifying his nausea and making him wonder if, in fact, he wasn''t actually doing the worms an injustice. Not for the first time that evening, Kretos cursed the general.</p>\r\n<p>Kreto’s intent had been to deliver his message, get a quick answer and be on his way without delay. </p>\r\n<p>He had intimated as much to General G''narch who had only sneered menacingly and told Kretos that he had other business to attend to first and Kretos would just have to wait until he had time to deal with him. Kretos had little option but to obey, for he dared not return without the information Duman desired. So he was stuck here, enduring the taunting jeers and threats of the group of grachtan soldiers until G''narch deigned to put in an appearance. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, his head was yanked back and a filthy hand rammed a scoop of worms into his mouth, while another pair clamped his mouth shut and forced him to swallow. Kretos felt himself go green as the worms writhed and wriggled down his throat. Those around him shouted snorting guffaws like the mindless animals they were and slapped each other on the back.</p>\r\n<p>Snivelling Kretos whined and cried but put up no resistance to their spiteful handling, nor did he retaliate verbally to the cruel jibes and insults aimed at him.</p>\r\n<p>Rebellious Kretos seethed with hatred and silently vowed he would see them all dead. Until then he would take comfort in another way. Plastering a look of pathetic helplessness on his face, Kretos allowed his churning stomach to retch violently and his unwanted supper was neatly deposited into the lap of his nearest tormentor. The gracht loosed his grip on Kreto’s neck as he jumped up to clear his lap and round angrily on his laughing companions. Kretos seized his chance and, under the guise of apologetic cringing, backed away towards the darkness at the edge of the camp. The grachtan soldier was not to be appeased by words and advanced upon him threateningly. Though unable to understand the words the soldier uttered, the accompanying gestures translated quite plainly that Kretos was about to get his neck wrung. He decided it was time to drop the act and make a run for it. He turned quickly but just as quickly found himself seized by the nape. His legs pumped in uselessly in mid-air as he was turned to face his tormentor. With a sick grin the gracht slowly raised his other hand and placed it upon Kreto’s head ready to make the final twist. Spots flickered in front of Kreto’s bulging eyes and the world began to spin. Flashes of memory raced through his mind as consciousness started to recede. </p>\r\n<p>"G''DACK! Drop it!" The voice of General G''narch roared over the shouting mob. "Unless of course, you really want to explain personally to the Master why his messenger did not return."</p>\r\n<p>G''dack froze in the sudden silence. With a grunt of disappointed disgust, he threw Kretos forcibly to the ground. He rolled across the dirt to G''narch’s feet, who kicked him viciously in the face. Blood spurted from his lip and nose.</p>\r\n<p>"Get up,” he ordered, raising his voice so that his next words might reach across the camp. "Tell His Mightiness that three hundred thousand Gracht plus an equal count of lesser forces, shall await his bidding in the time and place of his command." </p>\r\n<p>Thankfully the distortion caused by his rapidly swelling face disguised the grimace of dismay that Kretos could not control. </p>\r\n<p>"I shall go immediately and inform the Master. He will be most pleased," muttered Kretos, cowering submissively as he backed away. </p>\r\n<p>The General dismissed him with a grunt, already turning away to accept the cheers and accolades of the other gracht. Kretos kept running until his legs were so tired that he was forced to sit down. A little grey rat with black legs popped its head from inside his shirt. He lifted it out onto his shoulder. Standing on its hind legs, it squeaked softly in his ear.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, too many," said Kretos. "And that''s not counting all the other minions at his disposal. The two-legs have no chance."</p>\r\n<p>The rat squeaked again, scratching its side and rubbing its foot on his shirt.</p>\r\n<p>"I know," Kretos lifted him round so he could look into his face. "I despise them too... but at least we can exist beside them. ''Out of sight-out of mind'' is their way. It''s not his way. I know his plans. He intends to leave none of the Mother’s children alive. The two-legs may be the first but eventually he''ll get round to us...&nbsp;aren’t we the Mother’s children too? This is no longer about our revenge Darkpad, it''s about our survival. And as ugly and distasteful as it may be, we have to do what we can to aid the two-legs. Duman must be stopped." He slipped Darkpad back inside his shirt and jumped to feet.</p>\r\n<p>Hurrying the final distance through the bogs, Kretos saw the flashing lights of energy sparking from the tower room and wondered what was happening there. His first thought was that it was yet another mess he would probably be left to clear up. His second thought was that luck was with him. If the wizard were going to be busy for a while it would give him the chance to do a few things he wanted to do before he announced his return. He slipped silently into the fortress, having first sent Darkpad ahead to ensure there were no prying eyes about. His first destination was the holding pens to make sure that what he needed was still there. Then it was back up into the main fortress, keeping low and close to the darkest shadows of the walls as he made his way to one of the smaller, un-warded rooms. Inside, the dust and cobwebs were thick and plentiful, indicating that no one had entered here for a long time. It was highly unlikely that the wizard would miss anything from here, he decided. He rummaged around. He tried not to disturb the dust too much, until he found what he sought...&nbsp;an old scroll, a quill and some ink. Secreting them in his shirt, he slipped back into the corridor and carefully closed the door behind him. Whispered squeaks alerted him to Duman’s presence and he hid behind one of the columns that separated the various levels in the fortress. He held his breath, fearful that the wizard might spot him and demand to know why he was skulking about the corridors. He need not have worried Duman was in no condition to take notice of anything. He looked old and haggard as he dragged himself along. His clothes and hair were a mess and he was muttering and moaning as though in great pain. Kretos smiled and wished him worse than he looked.</p>\r\n<p>When the coast was clear, Kretos emerged from his hiding place and hurried down into the tunnels. His family swept out to greet him and he sat amongst them, listening to all that had happened while he had been away and scribbling as best he could, a crude map of the interior of the fortress. It was not an easy task, given the fortress'' unnatural dimensional structure and the total, architectural disregard for what was and was not possible under the laws of physics.</p>\r\n<p>"Still, it''s more than they have now," he said aloud as he scrawled the final X’, which marked the location of the Summoning Chamber. He had also marked the other rooms wherein the Dragons were secreted, a rough guide of the main corridors and especially the runic safeguards and traps lain at specific points and rooms throughout the fortress. He held it up, nodding with satisfaction. A soft squealing and a large amount of nose twitching broke out amongst those around him.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, of course you wouldn''t recognise it," he said. "You travel Ak''thai along different passageways. These are routes the two-legs use." He turned the scroll over and wrote a short note upon the back, then folded it up and slipped it back in his shirt. He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes for a short nap while he waited for the runner to return with Duman’s whereabouts. All too soon, a gentle nibbling on his ear awoke him. Duman had disappeared into his casting room and seemed set to be there for some time. Kretos jumped to his feet. It was now or never. </p>\r\n<p>He had just entered the first floor holding pens when the shaking began. He paid little mind to it. The pens were situated directly beneath the casting room and the upper levels often bore the brunt of the violent overspill from above. It would settle down soon enough. Suddenly, there was a sickening wrench that turned his stomach and a great chunk of stone fell from the ceiling. Kretos was flung to the floor as tremor after tremor rumbled through the rock. Huge cracks appeared in the walls and some of the heavy, metal doors of the pens groaned and screeched as they twisted and bent. Only the magic with which they had been constructed prevented their buckling altogether and allowing the occupants to escape. Kretos heart raced. He had never known it this bad before. Whatever Duman was delving into must be very potent if the warding runes were having trouble containing it, he thought to himself as he was thrown yet again off his feet. He picked himself up with the happy thought that whatever it was might save them all a lot of trouble and do for the wizard right now! With one eye on the ceiling and the other on the shaking staircase in front, Kretos descended. A few floors down and the fortress'' reaction to Duman’s activities was less violent, merely a steady showering of dust, and he made it to the far end without further mishap. He slipped the bolt on the final pen and swung the door open. Crouched in one corner, on a pile of filthy straw and rags, sat an equally filthy and ragged human youth.</p>\r\n<p>"Two-legs!" Kretos kept his voice just barely above a whisper. "Come with me."</p>\r\n<p>The youth raised his head slowly. There was no trace of fear in the eyes that stared into Kreto’s own, just defiant hostility and a smattering of boredom. Kretos was impressed and decided that he had made a good choice.</p>\r\n<p>"What for?" The youth asked in unhurried insolence, making no move to do as he was told.</p>\r\n<p>"To live! Unless you prefer to end up a quivering mass of jelly in a jar somewhere?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yeah! Sure! And I''m supposed to believe that?" laughed the youth.</p>\r\n<p>"The only reason you haven''t already been sent for is because I''ve kept your presence here a secret. But it''s your choice," shrugged Kretos. "Be free or die?"</p>\r\n<p>The youth stared at him suspiciously, his eyes narrowing thoughtfully as if considering his options... though in truth his decision was already made. But it did not pay, experience had taught him, to appear too eager for it lessened ones'' bargaining power, so he waited until Kretos turned away and began to close the door before springing to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>He was fascinated by the weird shrieks and wails emanating from behind the locked doors as Kretos led him through the pens. However, it was impossible to see the nature of the creatures that made the sounds for the small barred holes were too high up. Finally though, a deep, sorrowful wail pierced his heart and he could contain his curiosity no longer. Grasping the bars, he pulled himself up to peek inside.</p>\r\n<p>"Fool,” spat Kretos as he yanked him down. </p>\r\n<p>"I only wanted to," the youth began, then stopped in horror as a razor-edged tongue whipped through the bars where only a moment ago his face had been. A shudder rippled down his spine and he swallowed hard, wiping his suddenly sweating palms down his legs.</p>\r\n<p>"Follow me. And stay away from the pens,” ordered Kretos. The youth nodded vigorously and followed Kretos to a small chamber just off to the side of the entrance to the pens. </p>\r\n<p>"We wait here until I know the way is clear," Kretos told him, crouching near the door.</p>\r\n<p>The youth slid down against one of the walls, pulling up his knees and hugging them to his chest in a deceptively relaxed posture. His head tilted slightly as he looked at Kretos from curious eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Okay?" he asked coolly. "What''s your angle?"</p>\r\n<p>"Angle?" Kretos frowned and shook his head. "I don''t understand?"</p>\r\n<p>"Why are you doing this? Helping me escape?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because I have a task I wish you to do for me."</p>\r\n<p>"Ah! I didn''t think it would be for free. What is it?"</p>\r\n<p>"I want you to take something to someone in a place called Symtar. You know this place?"</p>\r\n<p>"For my sins," groaned the youth, it was not his favourite place. "Why don''t you take it yourself?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because I can''t leave the fortress. I''m the Masters'' servant. If I leave, he''ll know, his eyes are everywhere. He would find me and then all my efforts would''ve been wasted."</p>\r\n<p>"Sounds feasible," agreed the youth through pursed lips. "So, what is this something...&nbsp;and who gets it?"</p>\r\n<p>"A map of Runic Ak''thai... this place," Kretos explained when the youth gave him a quizzical look, " and the number of the wizards army."</p>\r\n<p>"An army? War''s broken out?" The youth let out a low whistle. "How long have I been here?" </p>\r\n<p>"Not long and not yet. But it will, as soon as Duman has made his final preparations."</p>\r\n<p>"So you want me to take this map to... whom? The King? One of the Orders?"</p>\r\n<p>Kretos frowned. Who should he send it to?</p>\r\n<p>"I leave that to you to decide. So long as it gets to someone that will use it."</p>\r\n<p>"And what if I just decide to throw it away and run? After you get me out, I mean."</p>\r\n<p>Kretos studied the youth carefully. His face was open as was his manner. Though it went against the grain for him to admit it, there was something about this two-legs that he liked.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t think you will... or you wouldn''t be asking me that question... but so that you know, my family is many. When they find you... and they will... you die," answered Kretos bluntly.</p>\r\n<p>"Clearly put,” laughed the youth. "I like honesty in negotiations. It''s a deal!"</p>\r\n<p>Rising, he spat into his palm and extended it towards Kretos who stared at it blankly. The youth took one of Kreto’s hands and pumped it firmly, twice. Kretos shrugged and gazed at him in bemusement as he wiped his hand down his leg. The strange ritual was totally lost on him.</p>\r\n<p>"You haven''t been about much, have you?" grinned the youth. Kretos shrugged again, then turned away as a faint scratching from the other side of the door told him the coast was clear. He beckoned the youth to follow. </p>\r\n<p>Though he moved quickly along the maze of stairs and corridors, the youths'' mind and highly developed sense of direction was even quicker and he memorised every twist and turn. It was more from habit than a deliberate action since (the more he saw, the more he was sure) he had no intention of ever returning to the place! When they arrived at the tunnel mouth on the cliff face, Kretos gave the youth the map and instructions on how to get away without detection.</p>\r\n<p>"It will demand a great deal of patience, but it can be done," he finished.</p>\r\n<p>The youth nodded and stepped out onto the ledge, paused, then turned and gazed at curiously at the filthy, ragged, strange-featured creature to which he was about to owe his life.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re taking a great risk. Not only setting me loose but sending out this information," he tapped the map in his pocket. "Will you tell me why?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because Duman’s plans are not restricted to just the two-legs, they include all life. For your kind I care nothing but when he''s done with yours... he will turn to mine." </p>\r\n<p>"Your kind, my kind... you said that before. I don''t understand?"</p>\r\n<p>A high-pitched squeak left Kreto’s lips and scores of rats swept out of the tunnels. Some ran up his legs and settled on his head and shoulders, eyes blinking, noses twitching as they gazed at the youth. </p>\r\n<p>"My kind," said Kretos, eyes fixed on the young Man’s face, waiting for the typical two-leg reaction of loathing and disgust. To his surprise he saw only acknowledgement and to his further surprise heard himself explaining. "The wizard turned me into what you see now but this is what I truly am. These are my true family. I''d risk anything for them."</p>\r\n<p>"That, I understand," said the youth, placing a hand on Kreto’s shoulder. Kretos frowned at the unfamiliar gesture before looking back at him doubtfully. The youth smiled.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps one day we can share stories. Oh! And in case you''re wondering? My name''s Velkaan," the youth smiled and then fell serious as he warned in a low tone. "If this Duman is all that you say, then you''re walking a very dangerous road. Be very careful, my friend." He gave Kreto’s shoulder a squeeze, stroked the rat that sat there and was gone, leaving Kretos confused and unsure how to react. A two-leg had called him ''friend'' and worried over his safety. He ran to the opening and leaned out.</p>\r\n<p>"Kretos,” he called up in a soft whisper. "My name''s Kretos."&nbsp;He felt a strange sense of disappointment when there was no answer. Why should he care anyway whether the two-legs knew his name or not? He shouldn''t... but he did. He picked Darkpad off his shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"Go with him," he ordered. "He may need help. Let others in the family know he''s a friend." A warm feeling swept through him as he said the word ''friend''. Family, Kretos had in plenty but he had never had a friend before. It was a new experience and it felt good. </p>\r\n<p>While Kretos made his way out of the tunnels to finally make his report to Duman, Velkaan was skimming up the cliff face with an ease born of long practise. Crossing the causeway however, was another matter. Kretos had not been joking when he said it would take patience! It was slower than slow, edging backwards on his belly then lying stiff as a corpse on the ice-cold stone until the red-beam eyes of the guardian passed over and by. Kretos had told him that if he so much as twitched, it would spot him. As he lay for the umpteenth time, waiting to snatch another few wriggles toward safety, he thought about Kretos and what he had said. Velkaan understood his love for his family, no matter what kind they were! And he understood his willingness to risk all, even death, for them. They were more alike than Kretos knew! </p>\r\n<p>The gargoyle’s eyes were almost directly over him. The redness of their beam reminded him of the colour of his fathers'' hair and his thoughts drifted to the past. He remembered his father; tall, strong, fearless and yet quiet and gentle. A Soyex raider, he had met Velkaan’s mother, a human woman, during an attack on a merchant ship in the Mungarra Straits. He had loved her from the moment he had set eyes on her and had forgone his share of the booty for her alone. The Captain of the ship had married them there and then, and though she had protested at the time, his mother had admitted later that she had felt the same way. As soon as the ship docked, they had gone to his fathers'' home. His family had been outraged by his affront in taking a foreign wife and worse, daring to bring her home to shame them. For a few years they had tried to remain in S''yumêrra... isolated... ostracized by all...&nbsp;until his mother had eventually persuaded his father to return to Rohansuk... there to start a new life with their two sons. They had bought and settled on a small farm. Had a daughter and two more sons, Velkaan and T''maih and for many years were happy. Velkaan had been seven years old when the brigands arrived. They had come galloping across the fields and had filled his father full of arrows before he had a chance to cry a warning or defend himself. Then they had broken into the house. His two elder brothers had died before they could even rise from their chairs. Playing on the floor on the other side of the table, Velkaan had jumped up, grabbed a fork and vaulting from a chair had managed to stab one in the neck before he was clubbed to the ground. Another of the men had kicked him across the room into the pile of logs stacked beside the fireplace. The pile toppled over onto his inert form. Out of sight and forgotten, it had saved his life. Much later, he awoke and crawled out from beneath the logs into his worst nightmare. He could still clearly remember the pools of blood on the bed linen and the torn clothing strewn about the room in which his mother and eight year old sister had been viciously abused. By the bed lay the crumpled body of T''maih, only two years old. His brains decorated the wall above the bed. Vomiting, he had run out of the house screaming for his father, only to find his lifeless body in the field. Velkaan had become a man that day. According to Soyex custom, he had lain his family in a single grave. He had cut off his left earlobe and placed it in T’maih’s hand and had taken a lock of hair from each, so that part of him might go with them and part of them might be ever with him. Then he had covered them with straw and lit it. Sitting beside the fire, he wept and kept weeping until it burnt no more. Covering the remains with dirt he had maintained his vigil by the grave, neither eating nor drinking until the mourning period was over. One day for each of the dead. At midnight on the sixth day he rose; custom satisfied and set out after those responsible. </p>\r\n<p>They were easy enough to find by following word of their bragging and the family pieces they had stolen and sold. He tracked them down to a village inn. Knowing he was outmatched for face-to-face confrontation, he had waited until they slept the deep sleep of the drunkard and then, calmly and without remorse, had climbed into their room and slit their throats. Afterwards he had marked the forehead of each man with a drop of blood from each of his victims, as was the Soyex way. </p>\r\n<p>To him it was the N''tùhk: The Rite of Reparation.</p>\r\n<p>Amongst his fathers'' people it would have been understood, even expected, and according to the manner of the N''tùhk, he had entered the inn and announced what he had done to those gathered there. Unfortunately, none of those in the inn were Soyex and instead of pity and understanding, they had called him an evil murderer and shouted that he should be strung from the nearest tree. He had run from the inn and, in need of comfort in which to grieve, had sought out his paternal family looking for love and solace. It was not to be. His grandmother had refused him family, name and home and told him to go. </p>\r\n<p>''Abomination of lust'' she had called him. </p>\r\n<p>He had spat on the sand and ground his heel upon the wetness that she might know he considered her less than the dirt beneath his feet. Then he had run from her presence, so she would not see his tears and he had been running ever since, living off his wits and skills to survive in a world in which he was an outcast. Shunned and despised, neither belonging to one race nor the other, he had never again returned to S''yumêrra.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh yes, Kretos, my friend. I understand you perfectly and that''s why I''m helping you!"</p>\r\n<p>A soft squeak in his ear made him jump. The guardians'' gaze had passed. He tweaked Darkpad’s tail gently in thanks and wiggled himself backwards. He felt the hard stone give way to spongy, wet grass. A bit further and he was on the top of the slope. Never taking his eyes from the sweeping head of the guardian, Velkaan pulled his knees up beneath him, took a deep breath and, whispering his Mother’s name for luck, flung himself backward down the slope. Over and over he tumbled until he was at the bottom. In one fluid movement he grabbed Darkpad and was up and running, as fast and as far as his legs would take him, away from the fortress.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 22, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

The spell had acted as a conduit and a backlash of power had travelled through it, across the astral plane to where he sat in his tower. Even though he had released some of the influx into the stone of the tower (now minus a roof and half a wall), he had still sustained a lot of damage himself. The backs of his eyes had been burnt, his only vision now being thousands of black and white spots. His ears were ringing deafeningly and trickles of blood dripped off his lobes and ran down his neck. Frazzled tufts of hair stuck out at odd angles from his otherwise baldhead, that pounded nauseously, and smoke filtered from his nostrils and mouth as he gasped for breath. His hands were black, his fingernails completely gone. But worse than all this was the fact that the overload of energy had caused his own power to earth which led to a draining of his life force. He cursed himself for having allowed it to run so low in the first place. He had been so pre-occupied of late that he could not even remember when was the last time he had re-charged it. Bowed so low he was almost doubled over, he dragged one painful limb after another in slow, agonizing steps out of the door. With clenched fists pressed hard against throbbing temples he lurched blindly along the corridors, having commanded his feet to take him where he wanted to be and allowed himself to be drawn along. <p></p>\r\n<p>How long he stood motionless before his burning brain realised he was no longer moving, he had no idea but eventually the fact registered and he dropped to his knees, feeling for the great eye that should be carved into the stone beneath his feet. It was there. Shaking hands pulled the key, hanging from a chain about his neck, from inside his robe. The top was round and flat, etched with the rune of a black flame. The length of it was cross-shaped, misaligned into three sections. He ran his hand over the lines of the carving until he found the centre and there he inserted the key. He turned it left until the first section slotted down into place, then right for the second and right again so that it clicked home, flush with the stone. With a great shuddering, stone grated harshly on stone as the statue of Ecos pivoted on its base, disclosing a cramped, spiral stairwell. </p>\r\n<p>With unsteady, doddering steps, Duman descended to the arched doorway below. A heavy portcullis clanged down behind him and five rune-marked stones protruded from the wall. Panting with exertion and pain, he banged the heel of his palm against his forehead willing his over-taxed brain to think clearly. One false move and metal spikes would extend from floor and ceiling to impale him there until he rotted. He squeezed his hands tightly together to still their trembling then cautiously traced the runes upon the stones. With a deep breath he pushed the first... then the second... the third. He paused. </p>\r\n<p>Four?&nbsp;Which one was number four? </p>\r\n<p>He couldn''t think through the rising pain. He pulled at the singed tufts on his head and bit down on his lip until it bled.</p>\r\n<p>"Think,” he screamed at himself. "''Iptu'' or ''Kadas''? Hurry! It''s taking too long. Think! Think!"</p>\r\n<p>His hand hovered uncertainly over the two stones, jumping from one to the other. Dust began to drift down from the ceiling as the spikes started to move. He had to make a choice or he was dead anyway. Taking a great gulp of air and holding it, he pushed in the stone marked with the rune of ''Iptu''. The spikes held, and then began to recede. The dust cleared in front of his face as he expelled his breath in a great ''whoosh'' of relief and slammed home the final stone. </p>\r\n<p>The door swung open and Duman fell through it. His strength was almost gone and he was forced to crawl around the circular room, moving from right to left, reciting the chant inscribed upon the walls. The sound of rushing wind howling across open spaces filled the room, yet not a breath of air was stirred. Very slowly something began to manifest itself in the centre of the room. Sinking quickly, Duman willed the column of black fire to hurry. Ethereal forms, shaded grey by the blackness, struggled to free themselves from their bondage. Stolen spirits trapped within the dark flame of evil, so that the wizard’s own life might be unnaturally prolonged by stealing theirs. Naked, Duman crawled into the flames. He had little strength, or time, left. Already his skin was beginning to shrivel and turn the black-green of decay as the putrid stink of rotting flesh filled the air. He lay, curled into a foetal position and let the fire caressed his dying body. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly he was thrown into convulsions, jerking and twitching uncontrollably, his eyes rolling up into his head and foaming saliva frothing from his mouth. Invisible hands jerked him roughly to his feet. He took a deep breath, inhaling both air and fire, letting it out in a blood chilling, fiery scream. His chest heaved and he took another breath. This time his reaction was less severe and he held the breath for a few moments, absorbing its life giving properties before letting it out slow and easy. By the time he was sated he was standing unaided, with outstretched arms and a look of pure joy and exultation radiating from his now youthful features as he revelled in the flickering embrace of the cold, black fire. It was with great reluctance that he stepped from the flames and pulled the tattered remains of his robe over a body now glowing with health and vigour. His mind was clear, his vision sharp and his ears perfectly attuned once more to the pulsating resonance of the fortress. Reversed incantation returned the column of fire back to the dimensional plane that contained it and him to the spot where the great eye lay carved beneath his feet. He removed the key and replaced it about his neck and set off down the corridor at a brisk pace, pausing at the intersection that led to his Casting room. Excitement lit his face as he stared down the dark passageway. He flexed his muscles, stretching his arms upwards and taking a deep breath. He felt gloriously alive... at the peak of his strength... and decided there would be no better time than now for the completion of his ''Shadow-spell''. So instead of returning to the tower to repair the damage it had sustained, he turned his steps to the Casting room. </p>\r\n<p>Over the past days Duman had revised and perfected the original formula before inscribing its completed permutation in his book of sorcery. His earlier workings had been devised to use the Shadow within the confines of the fortress, after the girl had been captured and brought to him. But he was not so confident now of her capture, at least not within the time limit now operating. Things were moving faster than he had anticipated. So what he now contemplated required a much higher degree of skill and precisely established commands, for he intended to send the Shadow out to the quarry... rather than wait for her to come to the Shadow. Though it sounded simple enough on the surface, it was nevertheless a precarious strategy... full of pitfalls... but one he was confident he would be able to achieve, if he got the sequence of magic and commands correct. So he had spent endless hours in ascertaining absolute perfection. He could not afford less, since once released from the boundaries of the fortress, the Shadow would become an entirely independent entity, able to act completely on its own cognisance. His only hold would be the ''prime directive'' woven into the spell and hence into the Shadows'' self-existence. He gave a self-satisfied smirk at the knowledge that he could not have achieved this casting before... no matter how well written the spell... for there had been one vital component lacking. But now, if he was correct, the girl had herself supplied him with the means for her downfall! </p>\r\n<p>The power he had discharged in the tower had been hers... not his. There should be some trace element of her essence mixed within the residue of burnt cloth. He pulled a few threads from his charred robe and dropped them into a bowl. Lighting a candle, he caressed the black flame with his fingertips as he called upon the rune of disclosure. Holding the candle upside-down, he drew the flame across the bowl. Sparks of resistance flared upwards, reacting to the proximity of the opposing force. With a whispered word to slow their motion, he snatched one of the sparks between his thumb and forefinger and, quickly setting the candle upright, dropped the spark into the centre of the black light. There was small ''pop'' of an explosion, causing the candle to waver for just a fraction of a second, and then a faint but perfect blue image of Alyse materialized within the flame. His predatory grin was purest evil as he snuffed the candle. Whistling softly, he prepared everything for his casting. </p>\r\n<p>The familiar buzz of excitement at the danger involved set his nerve ends tingling, bringing his skin alive with sensitivity. Though he was eager to get started he worked slowly, studiously, ensuring the precise combination of powders that marked the three pentagrams on the floor. He checked that the markings and numbers of runes etched upon the hard, black wax of the candles were exact. With atypical patience, Duman painstakingly arranged the components and accoutrements of his spell until he was satisfied everything was in its proper place and order. And when all that was done, he read and re-read his incantations one final time. </p>\r\n<p>Now he sat cross-legged in a large, candle-pointed pentagram, gazing in silent contemplation across the darkened room at the two, smaller pentagrams joined at one point by a single candle. In one lay the vial containing the worm from his previous casting... in the other, a dish containing a handful of energy-charged threads. The only sound in the room was the deep, rhythmic breathing of composed concentration. He was ready. With slow deliberation he raised his hands from across his knees. A snap of his fingers and the five candles that surrounded him flared into life with a soft ''whoosh''. Pinching a tiny flicker from each, he brought them together into a single black flame resting in the palm of his hand. He blew on the flame and it winked out, reappearing atop the other candle opposite him. He paused.</p>\r\n<p>With a deep breath, he began the permutation of incantations and gestures that initiated the first tract of his spell. Immediately, he was encased by the sparking hum of a force field. Levitating to candle-flame height above the floor he rotated a full circle, so that the fingers on his outstretched arms passed through the flames. Then he drew his fingers downwards in an inverted arc beneath his body. Black fire followed the path of his fingertips as he weaved the burning thread, as a spider weaves its web, until he was resting upon a living carpet of flickering blackness. Once all three protective measures were secure, Duman cast a holding spell and was able to relax slightly.</p>\r\n<p>The power of magic pulsed through his body like a second heartbeat that he could hear throbbing in his temples and at the base of his ears and throat. He breathed deeply, exhaling slowly, willing the potent rush of magic and blood to his head to subside. Sweat dripped like raindrops from his overheating body onto the stone below. A shaking hand lifted and wiped his stinging eyes with the sleeve of his robe. Black and swollen veins strained against the taut, red-flushed flesh of his face and neck and across the back of the hands now clasped together in his lap. The concentrated power and magic that was making his blood boil began to leak out into the room through the shimmering haze of heat, rising from him in a green-speckled mist that popped ineffectually against the force field. But it was not the exertion of the raising of his protective measures that intoxicated the wizard almost to the point of unconsciousness. No. These were after all relatively easy and mundane spells for so skilled a sorcerer, though it must be said it was a rare occurrence to employ three such measures at one time. Each phase had to be sustained individually whilst the next was erected and then their respective resonance (for each casting gave off its own unique tone) had to be perfectly harmonized in synchrony with each other before the holding spell could be cast, since the nature of the holding spell meant it could be cast only once... any subsequent hold negating the one previous to it. All that aside, it was still not enough to create such a severe physical reaction so early in a casting. It was rather, the thrill of what was to follow that caused the symptoms of his addiction for the dangerous unknown, to manifest themselves. He knew that the entire casting which was to come was wrought with all the perils of new and untried spells. He sat for some time, eyes closed, gently massaging his temples and humming a soothing chant, willing himself to inner calm and control. The crackling tension in his body and in the air eased as he focused his centre being into one, single-minded awareness. When he was sure he was ready, and not a moment before, Duman opened his eyes and fixed his vision squarely on the vial opposite.</p>\r\n<p>His lips barely moved as he muttered in the obscure, archaic language that was a combination of ancient Huri and the mysterious speech of the black runes. The pentagram containing the vial glowed in response and from its five points, shafts of deep-green light beamed upwards and converged at a single apex. Inside this force field, in accordance with his mimed commands, the stopper squeezed itself from the mouth of the vial, which then tipped slightly, releasing the worm. It wriggled and squirmed in reaction to the cold stone. A thin, black thread extended from its proboscis, enlarging and expanding until finally, the full form of Duman’s shadow stood revealed and the worm host was no more than a dried husk at its feet.</p>\r\n<p>Almost at once, Duman began to sense the first strains of defiance and the inevitable tug of wills he always encountered between himself and those things summoned to do his bidding. This he was prepared for. He was not prepared however, for the eerie sensation of pulling against himself. This inner turmoil took him by surprise and he was un-nerved at finding himself in the position of not only fighting against the Shadows'' resistance but his own desire to obey himself and give in. It was therefore, a double strain upon his resources when the Shadow attacked and tested the barriers that constrained it and it took a great deal of forceful determination, and indeed self-sacrifice, to resist and overcome the desire to set himself free and sever the last remaining link between his two selves. When it was over Duman doubled up in pain, experiencing a strange, yet very real and very deep, sense of loss and sadness as yet another part of him died inside. For the first time in centuries hot tears stung his eyes and washed his cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>Aware of the wizard’s distraction, the Shadow seized the opportunity to break itself free. It almost succeeded! The buckling barriers alerted Duman’s attention and his self-pity was swept away in a rush of annoyance. With a swift command, he reinforced the barriers and the Shadow was hurtled, with a smoking flash that blew it apart, back into the centre of the pentagram. Re-forming itself, it threw back its head and a gaping hole that was its mouth appeared. There was no sound but the air vibrated to its silent howl of enraged frustration. Duman noted with fascination that within the shadows'' blackness was concealed a brilliant light of dazzling whiteness. He would have liked to have investigated this phenomenon further, but he was not about to allow himself to be distracted a second time, sensing the Shadow arming itself for another, more conservative attack. Clenching and unclenching his fists, Duman released bolts of stabbing energy down the apex of green light, pounding the shadowy form time and again, until all resistance faded and it sank, shapeless, to the ground. </p>\r\n<p>Though it had conceded to his dominance, Duman knew the defiance within it was not defeated. How could it be? The Shadow was a part of himself. That sullen brooding would, he knew, always remain a central vein in the very core of its being... and Duman was content to leave it so for he had no desire to break it, as with other of his minions, only to obtain and enforce its acceptance and compliance to his superiority. This had not been easy, since it was a far greater aim than the other option and by the time the Shadow surrendered to his will, Duman was panting under the physical and mental exertion. He would have liked to rest a while but knew he dared not spare the time to do so. Calling upon his reserves of strength he began the second tract. Keeping one single strand of his mind fixed alertly on the Shadow, Duman banished all other thoughts and concentrated on the shape and pitch of a new rune he had created, using only the power of the Dragons in order to keeps its conception hidden until this moment.</p>\r\n<p>It was the rune that displayed his own name. Dhukma! </p>\r\n<p>Carved in the language of the Black Runes, it was the manifestation of his will and the means of summoning to his strength, the depth of power and purpose of the secrets of the Dark Magic. For over four centuries (such potent magic is not something to be rushed) he had worked upon it, that he might loosen the grip of subjugation that the Black Runes held over him. He would still need the cooperation and power of other runes to perform his magic... since each rune held only the strength and knowledge of the one and could not be transferred or stolen (though he was indeed working on that also!) But he would at least now be on an equal footing and not the underling that had so irked and dented his pride. The others would be livid &mdash; to say the least, that he had dared to initiate himself into their ranks without their knowledge or permission but what form their anger would take remained to be seen. </p>\r\n<p>Insidious doubts crept unbidden into his mind as to his worthiness and strength to be included into their numbers. He grew less confident of his ability to fight, should they chose to do battle against his inclusion and as a dread fear that he might lose such a battle began to take hold in his heart, the burning fire of his body turned to ice. His fingers went numb, his teeth chattered uncontrollably while his throat went as dry as the Mornay. Cold sweat dripped down the back of his neck as these doubts eroded the confidence in his ability to perform this casting. He wavered on the brink of indecision, unsure of whether to proceed as he had planned or abandon this probably fatal course of insanity. Panic gnawed a hole in his chest as he foresaw innumerable, perilous mistakes in his calculations. The thread of contact between himself and the Shadow began to ''twang'', as it reformed itself in undulating waves from beneath his slipping control. He tried to steady it but his mind was just a collection of broken shards that had once been the mirror of his indomitable will. Something was not right! </p>\r\n<p>Even in the beginning, during his first delving into the unknown and the casting of his first spell, Duman had never experienced such an overwhelming sense of ineptitude and failure.</p>\r\n<p>Always, even in the darkest moments, he had been able to draw on the arrogance of his self-confidence to fortify any weaknesses and doubts his inexperience might unleash. Now he could find no trace of anything within himself save an awareness of his insignificance beneath the might and superiority of the others. </p>\r\n<p>"I will always be less than the others," he mumbled bitterly to himself. </p>\r\n<p>From deep within his chest began a rumbling and then wild laughter that brought tears to his eyes for a second time.</p>\r\n<p>''They knew!'' </p>\r\n<p>The others knew about Dhukma! </p>\r\n<p>He must have leaked the information during his weakened state within the Life fire. It was they who had instigated all the nagging doubts and fears that burst like a bubble now he realised their origin. He drew upon the knowledge of his skill, his successes and especially his hatred of all things, save his own self and ambitions, and felt his confidence return, his body calm and his mind clear. With renewed vigour he sent a punishing bolt down upon the Shadow, just to remind it he was still in control, and as he watched it squirm he sensed the wave of dismay echoing from the ranks of the others. His confidence soared still further as he realised he had won the first. It was a good omen and eager to continue, he signed the first in a long list of runes to be summoned during the progression of this tract. As it materialized in the open space of the room, he called forth Dhukma. It appeared in exactly the same place, interposing and overlaying it upon the first.</p>\r\n<p>Runes were elementals. Without sense or feeling. Knowing only existence or non-existence. Experiencing only superiority or enslavement. The creator of a rune entered into the bargain as the corporeal unit and as such, it was the creator who incurred the effects of whatever the rune was subjected to, accepting equally both punishment and reward. Duman gathered together all his strength in readiness to accept his part. During the initial struggle he endured no more than a dull headache. A hot/cold tingling in his fingers and toes that gradually migrated to the pit of his stomach. As the battle heightened however, he discovered the full cost of his bargaining. </p>\r\n<p>Though the room remained still and silent and the only visual signs was the intermittent fading, in and out, of the runes, the explosive disruptions emitted along the astral planes were deafening and agonizing, as blow after invisible blow hammered through him. He managed to offset and minimise the punishment using reflective and absorption spells. Even so, he was suffering. Dark bruises appeared from nowhere upon his body. One eye swelled shut. His lower lip split open, spurting blood down the front of his robe. As he rocked back and forth beneath the onslaught he wondered if it was really all worthwhile. Then suddenly; thankfully; blissfully; it was all over. His rune emerged victorious and he was rewarded by subservience and an influx of magic drained from the loser... which answered his question with a decisive ''YES!'' </p>\r\n<p>His wounds faded as swiftly as they had appeared and wasting no time on triumph, he instilled into the new runic composite the commands it would enforce upon the Shadow and sent it forth. It penetrated the outer blackness of the Shadow with a burning hiss, causing convulsive ripples to pour through it. Its violent reactions pummelled his defences. He thanked foresight for erecting, what seemed at the time, such extreme protective measures (which spared him the worst of the violent assault) and also, in a strange way, for the earlier incident that had forced him to retreat into the Life fire. Without that rejuvenation, he shuddered to think what the outcome might have been.</p>\r\n<p>Duman had deliberately chosen the most powerful of the runes he needed for the initial coupling, to stamp his authority and worth straightaway. Though there was still a certain amount of conflict with each successive summoning and victory, it lessened to no more than a perfunctory show of displeasure as the Others were forced to admit and accept him (as a legitimate and deserving power in his own right) into their ranks. Repeatedly, he integrated Dhukma with others and systematically imprinted the Shadow with a tiered layer of commands, concluding with the final and ultimate implantation of his singular rune, endorsing above all else his superiority and absolute control of his binding connection with the source.</p>\r\n<p>Just one last component and his servant would be complete. His body was aching and his mental capacity growing sluggish but there was no stopping now.</p>\r\n<p>Dropping the triangular field around the Shadow relieved some of his burden and he bathed in the intake of energy it released, sucking it into every atom of his being. It was not much, in magical terms, when compared against what he had expended, yet it supplied a welcomed boost. He lifted his arms out to his sides and began the last two incantations simultaneously, projecting one with his mind, whilst chanting the other. The two adjoining pentagrams began emitting a fluorescent pulse. With mind and magic he grasped one firmly in each mental hand. Comprised in this world of no more than a few handfuls of drifting powder, </p>\r\n<p>their astro-dimensional weight was incredible and something he had grossly underestimated. Grunting and groaning beneath the enormous pressure, he forced himself to hold on. </p>\r\n<p>By willpower, sheer stubbornness and a strength heavily laced with obstinate determination, Duman managed, one fraction at a time, to edge the pentagrams together. As they finally slotted into perfect alignment, it created a small tear in the fabric separating their parallel states of existence. A howling wind gushed forth, screaming upwards through the gap between his crossed thumbs and interlocking fingers. The room shook violently, as in the throes of an earthquake &mdash; the tremors rumbling throughout the entire fortress. Cracks appeared in the stone. Glass bottles and jars shattered into dust. Books, scrolls...&nbsp;anything and everything that was not fixed in place... and even some that were... were hurtled about the room, many disintegrating explosively upon the surrounding force field.</p>\r\n<p>Duman’s heartbeat increased threefold at the fury of the forces he had unleashed. Blood seeped from his pores as, all through his body, veins popped and burst, leaking their precious fluid into the blackening tissues of his swelling flesh. The friction between the magic within and the magic without burnt the palms of his hands. He willed himself to ignore the pain, the smoke filtering through his fingers, the smell of burning flesh singeing his nostrils, and managed to keep his hands locked tightly together. If they should lose their grip on each other it would mean oblivion. Through gritted teeth he croaked out his command. The candle opposite toppled over. Hot wax spilled upon the powdery markings of the pentagrams, travelling their lengths with hissing sparks and sealing the two into one. The invading destructive forces were sucked back and with a slurping ''pop'', the rift was sealed. </p>\r\n<p>It was as well that the next stage of commands had already been set to initiate upon the joining together of the two pentagrams, for Duman had nothing left and sank, wounded and weary, into the web of flames that supported him. Through kaleidoscopic vision, created by the combination of bloodied eyesight and drifting green mist, Duman watched the scene unfolding across the room. </p>\r\n<p>The Shadow spread its blackness across the bowl of thread. Shafts of light and energy erupted from within the depths of the bowl as the minute amounts of power retained in the scorched threads was sifted and discharged &mdash; as the energy was released and greedily absorbed by the Shadow, the black form started to writhe. For one instant, when her essence was fully revealed, Alyse’s features took shape, superimposed in colourless grey upon the featureless black face of the Shadow. Despite his pain and exhaustion, Duman gave a triumphant and self-satisfied smile. </p>\r\n<p>It was done! Complete! Successful! </p>\r\n<p>He dropped the holding spell. The force field about himself dissipated, the burning web unthreaded itself back into the flames of the five candles and Duman floated gently to the floor. He snuffed the candles and the pentagram in which he sat disappeared. Using the magic this released to him, he cast a small healing spell and lay back to allow the green mist, that rolled in hungrily to occupy the space previously denied it, to bathe his parched and flagging body with its energy filled magic. Once refreshed, he stood before the pentagram that bound the Shadow. A click of his fingers dismissed it and another brought the waiting host to his hand. He held the limp, unconscious wood pigeon up to the light of the candle in his other hand, so that its shadow touched the blackness of his own which immediately began to flow into it. When the two were one, Duman blew out the candle and cast it aside. Holding the now conscious bird firmly, he transported to his tower room and there he released it. Without hesitation, the pigeon flew off towards the setting sun.</p>\r\n<p>Duman poured himself a goblet of wine and settled back to relax on the couch.</p>\r\n<p>''It has been an eventful day!'' he thought to himself. ''A day to be forgotten in its pain yet remembered in its success and the great leap forward he had taken in his skill, knowledge and position within his Art.''</p>\r\n<p>More than pleased with the days'' results, he closed his eyes for a much-deserved sleep.</p>\r\n<p>But instead of quiet solitude there came a hesitant rapping on the door and Kretos scuttled, breathless and cringing, into his presence.</p>\r\n<p>M... master,” he stammered, falling at the wizard’s feet. "I''ve been looking for you everywhere. I b... bring wonderful n... news from G... g... general G... g''narch. You w... w... will be m... more than pleased."</p>\r\n<p>"Well... out with it,” snapped Duman impatiently.</p>\r\n<p>"Three h... hundred thousand s... s... strong... of g... gracht alone... is y... y... your army, M... m... master."</p>\r\n<p>"And the rest?"</p>\r\n<p>"An eq... equal n... n... number, Great One."</p>\r\n<p>"This is indeed good news. You''ve done well. I am most pleased," smiled Duman and for once his tone reflected the truth of his words. He waved Kretos to his feet. Kretos was frozen. All he could do was stare at Duman in terrified confusion. All his miserable life he had never known the wizard to be honestly pleasant to anyone or anything, there was always that underlying trace of jeering sarcasm and sadistic superiority. </p>\r\n<p>Was this an act set to trap him? </p>\r\n<p>Did the wizard know or suspect something? </p>\r\n<p>Kretos felt a rising panic and froze.</p>\r\n<p>“Calm yourself, fool,” he berated himself, realising he was drawing Duman’s attention as the wizard’s pupils shrank to a pinprick, “before you give yourself away.” “If he suspected anything, you would be a puff of smoke already!” </p>\r\n<p>Kretos let instinct and experience take over and rising, he bowed low using the time to replace his fear with an expression of moronic pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>"Th... thank you, M... m... master," he gushed. "It is a... a... always my aim t... t... to p... p... lease. I l... live b... but to s...&nbsp;s... serve you." For once his stammer was not entirely feigned.</p>\r\n<p>"As well to remember it,” warned Duman, the arrogant sneer once more in evidence.</p>\r\n<p>"A... a... always, M... m... master." Kretos hid his inward sigh of relief in vigorous nodding and bobbing as he backed quickly towards the door.</p>\r\n<p>"Good! We have guests in the lower tower. Attend to their needs," ordered Duman from behind closed eyes, already floating on the drifting mists of sleep before Kretos had shut the door.</p>\r\n<p>He was woken by the heralding horns of the Grachtan army and, rushing to the window, was greeted by the sight of thousands of flickering campfires adorning the otherwise dismal landscape. It was a sight he had long awaited. The beginning of the end!</p>\r\n<p>After summoning Kretos and instructing the snivelling wretch to take the goblins to their rightful place at the head of the army, he settled back to enjoy the inevitable bloodshed through the portal he had conjured in the windows'' aperture. He anticipated the spectacle to be highly rewarding. G''narch would not relinquish his position freely.</p>\r\n<p>Through the portal he saw G''narch and several of his highest ranking underlings emerge from a tent at the front of the camp. As the goblins came into view of the gracht, they became the objects of much pointing and jeering and obscene gestures. The goblins, however, appeared to be ignoring all this, their eyes fixed only upon the group of leaders ahead. He saw Kretos move forward and though the portal offered vision only, there was no mistaking the fact that G''narch was arguing with him furiously. Kretos pointed back to the fortress and G''narch backhanded him to the ground. As Kretos made to rise, Ishtak kicked him aside and out of Duman’s view. The goblin strode boldly forward, face to chest with the general and offered him Challenge. G''narch laughed in his face and waved him away contemptuously but Ishtak dropped into combatant posture and prodded him in the chest with his sword. G''narch must accept or lose face. He accepted with a bored nod and then proceeded to step backwards, motioning one of his subordinates to face the goblin. Such behaviour was quite acceptable to the gracht... though Ishtak was more than a little confused by it. In fact the chosen champion would deem it a great honour to fight in the generals'' stead.</p>\r\n<p>This one was no exception and accepted the position eagerly, seeing an easy victory and through it, the opportunity for promotion. His jeering swagger revealed the derisory manner with which he regarded the diminutive figure of Ishtak, as he moved forward in a nonchalant, lazy fashion and threw an idle swing at Ishtak’s head with the flat of his sword. The goblin raised his shield but still the force of the blow knocked him over and he lay, apparently winded, on the ground. The grachtan soldier raised his arms to the crowd in triumph and then made to jump upon his downed opponent. Duman looked on in surprised disappointment when Ishtak made no move to defend himself. He had expected better than this from the goblin. Then, at the last possible moment, Ishtak rolled between the grachts'' legs, his blade slicing deeply through the creatures'' soft groin. The gracht dropped to one knee, roaring in pain. Ishtak flung himself onto the grachts'' back, totally ignoring the sharp claws that raked his flesh trying to drag him off. Using his long arms to their full advantage, he reached around his opponents'' neck and skimmed the point of his dagger down the scaly throat until he heard it click against the end of one of the scales. With an expert flick, he slipped the dagger between the two scales and, after a quick adjustment of his grip, thrust powerfully upwards. Having penetrated the armour, the sharp blade sliced easily through muscle and sinew and up through the mouth into the brain. Ishtak jumped clear as the gracht toppled backward, claws clenched around the hilt of the dagger protruding from his throat. He was dead before he hit the ground. </p>\r\n<p>Nobody moved save Ishtak. While the crowds stared in stunned silence, Ishtak leapt onto the grachts'' chest, kicked his arms away and grasping the hilt of his dagger, pulled it free. Turning to G''narch, Ishtak stared the general straight in the eye as he flicked off the excess goo with a look of bored disdain. G''narch was furious. He punched the gracht nearest to him and pointed angrily at the dead body. The gracht rushed forward and grabbing the feet, dragged the body to the bogs and rolled it in with disgust. The bubbling mud slurped greedily as it sucked the body down out of sight. Ishkat was most fascinated with the process and her own body swayed in time with the slowly disappearing corpse. She giggled in delight. Each time the bubbles popped it reminded her of the way Ishtak belched at mealtimes. </p>\r\n<p>Thinking to take advantage of her apparent pre-occupation, G''narch nudged forward another of his underlings. Though it was clear from the chosen grachts'' expression that he thought fighting a female was beneath him, he obeyed. To refuse would mean being sneered at and branded a coward, at least for the short time it would take for G''narch to have him executed as a traitor for refusing an order! His best option, he decided, was to get the humiliating experience over with quickly and so he rushed forward, swinging his tail around with the intention of swatting her off balance and into the bog. </p>\r\n<p>Ever alert, Ishkat was warned by the soft ''whuff'' of air displaced by the tails'' movement. Quick as a flash she spun... impaling the tail to the ground with the axe Duman had given her. The grachts'' next and final error was to bend over to remove it. Ishkat’s arms snapped forward. Faster than they were in her hands, the two knives were sent spinning, one into each of the grachts'' eyes. She followed them in, retrieving her axe on the way and with a mighty swing, decapitated the helpless gracht. Again, the camp was held in frozen disbelief and again G''narch received the full weight of goblin contempt as Ishkat lifted her fallen opponent and laid him gently into the bog.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the tower, Duman was positively gloating. Grinning so wide his face began to ache, he rubbed his hands together in delight while Ishkat calmly wiped her soiled blades down the legs of her trousers before slipping them back onto her wrists. Duman reached across the table for his goblet, tipping it slightly in a laughing toast before bringing it to his lips and sipping the wine slowly while he waited for the general to finish his wild gesticulations at the fortress and make his next move. Duman had never realised that watching others could be as much fun as doing the killing oneself! </p>\r\n<p>"Now this should be interesting,” he murmured, placing the goblet down and leaning closer to the portal as two more gracht stepped into the fray. </p>\r\n<p>They approached cautiously, treating the goblins with greater respect than the previous combatants. It was a vicious battle. For though the gracht were obviously slower in both movement and thought than the goblins, they maintained the advantage of height and bulk, had the added bonus of an extra weapon in their tails and had learnt from the others'' mistakes. Ishtak and Ishkat had to work hard to inflict any damage on them at all and as the conflict continued, were both panting hard and bleeding from the many wounds they had received for their efforts. Duman’s face darkened, a worried frown creasing his brow and bringing his eyebrows to meet on the bridge of his nose. It was difficult to tell from his position, exactly how each was faring and the broad sneer stretched across G''narchs'' features was casting ugly doubts in his mind. Suddenly the goblins'' switched opponents. Caught unawares by this tactic both gracht hesitated, unsure what to do, and stupidly took their eyes off the goblins to look at each other. Who should fight whom? </p>\r\n<p>They never got the chance to work it out!</p>\r\n<p>"Clever! Very clever,” cried Duman, his frown now a delighted grin that spread from ear to ear as he watched the two gracht fall face down in the mud. But it was not over yet. </p>\r\n<p>As the two goblins squatted, exhausted and gasping for breath, G''narch decided it was now time for him to show his prowess. Stepping over his fallen underlings, he swept Ishtak aside with a hefty blow from his tail and rounded savagely upon Ishkat. Her vision severely impaired by the blood flowing from the deep cut just above her right eye, she barely saw the blow coming. She tried to avoid it but the raking claws slashed open her skull. Dizzily, she managed to duck beneath the second blow, shoulder rolling toward her axe still embedded in her previous opponent. Weak from loss of blood, she struggled to get it free and before she could do so, G''narchs'' tail sent her flying again. </p>\r\n<p>Shaking the blood from her eyes and the threat of unconsciousness from her brain, she hurled her knives and star weapons at G''narch in an attempt to keep him at bay and buy herself a little time. Still fresh, the general dodged them easily but her ploy had worked and she managed to open a small gap between him and her axe. She made a run for it, only to suddenly find herself hauled up and choking by the huge claws squeezing her neck. She struggled... twisted... punched and snapped at G''narchs'' arms. G''narch laughed in the face of her snarling jaws and tightened his grip. </p>\r\n<p>All this time, Ishtak had stood back. It was his mates'' fight. Now, as her face turned purple and her eyes bulged, he decided it was time to intervene. She was annoying, irritating and far from the usual and conventional mate but he had chosen her nonetheless and if the time ever came when he had had enough of her... he would be the one to kill her! He grabbed her axe and taking a wide swing, sliced through scale, muscle and bone. Ishkat fell to the ground, gasping for breath yet already pulling the claw from her neck and casting it aside. As G''narch stared stupidly at the bleeding stump that had been his arm, Ishkat slipped inside and with a deep growl, ripped open his groin with one massive bite. Sprayed with blood, she jumped back and howled as the former general toppled over onto his face. The two goblins climbed on his back and stood, proudly victorious amidst a tumultuous cheering. The Grachtan army it seemed had little love or loyalty for its recently demised leader. They kicked G''narch into the bog, then lifted the goblins onto their shoulders and carried them into his now vacant tent.</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere in the tower was one of intense, heady euphoria. Everything was working out perfectly! The goblins had proved themselves worthy to be called his children. The army had accepted them as leaders and, given a few days for the goblins to (quite literally) lick their wounds, it would be on the march and the world would tremble once again at his name. Duman’s eyes gleamed. The spectacle he had just witnessed had made him quite hungry. Throwing back the last of his wine, he closed the portal and left the tower. Stepping inside a small chamber within the west wing, he closed the door with slow intent.</p>\r\n<p>A piercing scream echoed down the empty corridor. </p>\r\n</div>', 1, 22, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(30, 'Asleep in the Mothers arms', 'CHAPTER EIGHTEEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<p>"Where am I?" Jarok cried out in a trembling voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Home."</p>\r\n<p>The soft, musical tone of the single word filled the room like the gentle trickling of a small waterfall and just like it, the speaker herself was a vision of loveliness. Eyes of sparkling sapphire beneath arched brows echoed the warmth of the smile that curved her cherry-ripe lips. Emerald-green hair flowed in luxurious waves almost to the floor and was strung with daisies and buttercups, while a circlet of ivy kept it from straying across her face. She wore a pale-green bodice above a dark-green skirt patterned with fragrant flowers. Over these was draped a sleeveless robe exquisitely embroidered with birds and animals. Her alabaster skin radiated a light and warmth that was reflected off the gold-tinted fingernails of the long, slender hand she reached out to him.</p>\r\n<p>He was eight years old. Alone in a dimly lit... somewhere... with a complete stranger, he had no idea where he might be or how he had gotten there. Yet, as her gentle fingers softly stroked his puzzled brow, all fear fled from him and he leant back into the circle of her arm.</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"You call me the Mother," she smiled down fondly.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''m dead,” he exclaimed, sitting bolt upright and pinching himself on the forearm. "Ouch! I don''t feel dead. What are dead people supposed to feel like?"</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="JarokReturns" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Jarok Returns" src="JarokReturns01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>Her gentle laugh washed over him like a refreshing shower on a hot, summers'' day.</p>\r\n<p>"No, Jarok. You are not dead"</p>\r\n<p>"Then what am I doing here?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because you called me. Sleep awhile."</p>\r\n<p>"But I''m not tired and there are so many things I want to ask you," he argued. "Like, why doesn''t my leg hurt anymore? And what happened to Tielan? And.?</p>\r\n<p>"Questions, questions,” she laughed again, placing a finger on his lips and kissing the top of his head. "Just like your father when he was a child. Sleep now. Later, you will know all." She blew softly across his face and his eyelids drooped heavily. "Watch over him," she whispered softly before she left.</p>\r\n<p>The tree beneath which he lay covered him with a blanket of leaves, and from amidst its rhythmic rustling came the whispering strains of a strange lullaby.</p>\r\n<p>Winter. Spring. Summer. Fall,</p>\r\n<p>Eight of each thou hast in all.</p>\r\n<p>Too young has Fate thrown over thee</p>\r\n<p>The heavy cloak of thine Destiny.</p>\r\n<p>But now, the sands of time run free</p>\r\n<p>That thou obtain maturity.</p>\r\n<p>While seasons come and seasons go,</p>\r\n<p>Sleep ye, Jarok. Sleep... and grow.</p>\r\n<p>And so he slept. </p>\r\n<p>He slept thick and heavy in a wild, fantasyland where all things were possible. </p>\r\n<p>A land filled with jewelled eyes and flaming breath and the touch of clouds upon his face. </p>\r\n<p>Once, frightened by the sight of the Earth far below and the sun almost touching his shoulder he cried out, forcing his eyes to open. Above him, the ancient oak rose naked in gnarled splendour. Beside him, sat the Mother. He knew it was she by the touch of her hand that soothed his brow and the loving smile that softened the corners of her eyes. But now they glittered like diamonds and her red lips were dusted with frost in a pale, almost colourless, face framed by hair of glacial blue that was swept up beneath a wreath of holly. The robe on which his head rested was white and soft as freshly fallen snow and her touch, like the misted breath that drifted across his face, was ice.</p>\r\n<p>Once again, the lullaby filled his ears but this time deeper and slower... as though the singer herself was also half asleep.</p>\r\n<p>Sleep thou still. It is too soon.</p>\r\n<p>The sun has barely chased the moon</p>\r\n<p>twelve seasons yet across the sky,</p>\r\n<p>Twenty-eight still left to fly.</p>\r\n<p>Come and go ye seasons... Turn.</p>\r\n<p>Sleep thou, Jarok. Sleep... and learn.</p>\r\n<p>Again he slept. And again he dreamt.</p>\r\n<p>He was a wolf... a deer. A cat... a mouse, </p>\r\n<p>Every creature that ever walked upon the Earth,</p>\r\n<p>He was an eagle... a sparrow, A bee... a fly, </p>\r\n<p>Every creature that ever flew above the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>He was a worm... a beetle... an ant, </p>\r\n<p>Every creature that ever dwelt beneath the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>He was a tree... a bush. A flower... a blade of grass. </p>\r\n<p>Every plant that ever grew from the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>He was a mountain. A rock. A single particle of soil.</p>\r\n<p>And thus he learnt... </p>\r\n<p>He was the Earth!</p>\r\n<p>He awoke on a start of realisation that left him aghast with wonder. His heart fluttered wildly in his chest at the magnitude of ''what'' and ''who'' he truly was. He could scarce believe it but he could feel the Power pulsing through his body. Yet it was different to what his dreams had led him to expect it to be. Something was missing. Eagerly he awaited the touch of Ecos in his mind. Nothing happened. He spun around, lost in his new awareness and like a child abandoned, cried out accusingly.</p>\r\n<p>"Where is he? What have you done?"</p>\r\n<p>Dried leaves dropped from her gown, crunched underfoot as she glided toward him. Warm, hazel eyes gazed sadly from within her plump, rosy-cheeked face. She sighed deeply, pushing the braid of wheat coloured hair she had been plaiting back over her shoulder before she spoke.</p>\r\n<p>"The Power you are can exist in many shapes and forms but the entity that is Ecos can exist only in one time and place. That is the law of Nature. Ecos has chosen Alyse. He cannot be a part of you anymore. You are a new creation... You are&nbsp;''Power Reborn''. Come my son."</p>\r\n<p>"Where are we going?"</p>\r\n<p>"To keep a promise," she replied vaguely.</p>\r\n<p>It was not so much that they moved but that the Earth moved around them and they were drawn through it until it opened up into a new chamber. Frost-hardened grass rose up into small mounds and from each mound there came up a young sapling, strung with tiny lanterns no bigger than his thumb. Rainbow light radiated from within them and was reflected off the veins of gold running through the rocks onto the glass of an oval mirror set in a square, marble frame. Jarok stood before the mirror and touched the swirling mist that denied the eye. It parted slowly and he stared with interest at the reflection that appeared: his reflection, with the Mother’s loving arm about his shoulder. </p>\r\n<p>It was a tall body, taller than his sister, Alyse. He was slim and lithe, rather than muscular (but not skinny) and firm of flesh that was tanned a golden brown. His hair, now a soft brown and less curly than it had been and swept back from a central parting in sleek waves, was tucked behind his ears emphasizing a strong jaw line, full lips and a nose slightly longer than he had imagined it would be when he grew up. Apart from the earthy blackness of his eyes, he no longer resembled the child he had been.</p>\r\n<p>"Do I really look like that?" he wondered aloud, uncertain as to whether he found the reflection pleasing or not.</p>\r\n<p>"You may change any aspect of your appearance that is not to your liking but yes, this is how you look. Or rather, how the Power perceives itself in human form."</p>\r\n<p>Before he could answer, two figures appeared through the mist making the decision for him. He knew who they were: Sh''ailon, the Elfin who had given birth to him and her husband, Kielton.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok,” cried Sh''ailon running forward to embrace him. "The Mother said you would come. You are just as I imagined you to be."</p>\r\n<p>"You''ve grown into a fine man," observed Kielton, smiling as his handshake turned into a backslapping hug.</p>\r\n<p>"I dreamt of such a moment all my life," admitted Jarok with trembling chin and brimming eyes. "Yet now it''s here, " he shook his head helplessly.</p>\r\n<p>"Now, we''re not who you thought we were. And you''re not what you thought you were. And you have no words. It''s alright," smiled Sh''ailon. "You don''t need to say anything. We only wanted to see you safe and grown. To know the decisions we made had been the right ones."</p>\r\n<p>She kissed his cheek and they turned to walk back into the mist.</p>\r\n<p>"Wait,” cried Jarok. He turned to the Mother. "May I?"</p>\r\n<p>She nodded.</p>\r\n<p>His reflection placed his palm upon the earth and as he rose, the soil beneath it rose with him. The column of earth began to mould itself into an image and for a few moments Alyse stood beside him. Sh''ailon grasped her husbands'' hand, her other coming up over her mouth as she sobbed tears of joy. Their joined hands reached up to touch Alyse’s cheek as the image smiled. Too soon it sifted back into the earth. Sh''ailon pressed her lips together. She nodded to Jarok, too choked to speak.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," said Kielton, his own voice thick with emotion. </p>\r\n<p>The mist began to whirl with agitation.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s time for us to go. Good-bye. And be careful," Kieltons'' voice drifted back through the mist and then they were gone. </p>\r\n<p>The earth shifted again. Jarok found himself in a large, glacial cavern and followed the Mother around the crystalline hedge bordering the path leading to a deep pool of clear, sparkling water. Carved high in the jagged walls of ice were the heads of five Dragons, mighty horns curving up into the ceiling. Tongues of ruby fire flamed from massive jaws and suspended between the flames was a web of the finest spun gold. At each joint of the web, strung along delicate strands of silver of various lengths, precious gems cut in intricate detail dangled over the pool like a priceless mobile. Emerald trees, ruby roses, squirrels of jade and diamond whales to name but a few. The pale-blue light of the glacier refracted through the cut stones to create a prism of intense colour. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly a small geyser erupted, sending a spray of water up through the centre of the web. It reached its zenith in a wide cloud and returned to the pool in a rainbow shower, striking the gems on its way and causing each to resonate according to its shape and size. The single notes each created were taken up through the vibration of the web and filled the entire cavern with the echoing strains of an exquisite symphony, which began enchantingly light and carefree yet faded on a melancholic note of sadness that pierced the heart and spirit. The Mother held out her hand and caught the tears that dropped from Jarok’s eyes, each one hardening as soon as it touched her palm. When it was full she closed her hand and plunged it into the pool.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s beyond words," Jarok breathed as the last echo died away. </p>\r\n<p>"Your father created it for me. It is a special place." </p>\r\n<p>A weariness born of great sorrow etched deep lines about her eyes and paled the rosy hue of her cheeks. A well of pity rose in Jarok’s heart.</p>\r\n<p>"You miss them all very much, don''t you?"</p>\r\n<p>"I never truly understood the mortal concept of loneliness until they were gone," she admitted.</p>\r\n<p>He took her hand and kissed it.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman shall not win. I will bring them home to you," he promised solemnly.</p>\r\n<p>"You will need this... for Alyse. She is going to look for the Crystal Tomb." She opened her hand. The solidified teardrops had welded together into a single, iridescent crystal sparkling on her palm. Jarok gazed up at her in silent question.</p>\r\n<p>"This crystal contains four unborn lives, relinquished freely, that those who are needed might live," she told him.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok took it and held it against his lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," he whispered. </p>\r\n<p>The crystal blinked in blinding brilliance and then faded until it resembled no more than a piece of rock. He made to slip it into the pouch that hung across his chest but the Mother reached out and stilled his hand.</p>\r\n<p>"You will have to leave that here," she said. "Alyse will recognise it immediately and you must maintain your anonymity even from her, till the moment is upon you."</p>\r\n<p>"But surely, she will know me anyway," he asked, loathe to part with the last remaining link of his former self.</p>\r\n<p>"No. For though you and they are of the same, Alyse’s portion is but a drop in the ocean.</p>\r\n<p>You are more powerful than Ecos in his entirety... even more than myself." She nodded, giving him a wry smile as gazed at her in surprise. "Unless you desire it, you can conceal your nature from them."</p>\r\n<p>"Does my father know this?"</p>\r\n<p>She shook her head, a smile of indulgence now playing softly upon her lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Even if he suspected, I am afraid he is too proud to ever admit it!"</p>\r\n<p>"Elfin and Dragons,” Jarok murmured quietly to himself.</p>\r\n<p>She raised a curious eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p>"Just something Cymon told me once," he lifted one shoulder in a vague shrug. "Where are they now. Cymon and Alyse?"</p>\r\n<p>"They are in Phelise but you cannot just appear there. The Elfin would know you did not enter through the gateways. And besides, the gateways themselves would reveal your nature."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok leaned over and gazed into the pool. Thousands of images flickered simultaneously yet he had no trouble picking out a single one.</p>\r\n<p>"There," he pointed. "A child is soon to be born in Talgheer. His entrance into the world will mask my own from Duman’s prying eyes."</p>\r\n<p>"I have a gift for you before you go. You might find them useful," said the Mother, with a twinkle in her eyes, and in her arms appeared a set of clothing. Jarok looked down at his own tattered shirt and trousers and grimaced. Apart from being dirty and torn, they were halfway up his legs and arms! He gave the Mother a pained look. She laughed. </p>\r\n<p>"Even had I not made this for you, I would not let you have left thus. I just wondered how long it would take you to notice." </p>\r\n<p>"I have been somewhat preoccupied," he defended himself. </p>\r\n<p>"Here," she held out her bundle. </p>\r\n<p>The suit hung loosely, for unrestricted movement, but tapered in to fit snugly around his ankles and wrists where it was drawn over the back of his hand and held in place by a loop around his middle finger. A sash pulled it in at his waist. The hood was separate, covering his head and face so that only his eyes were visible, but once it was secured around his throat it was impossible to tell. A pair of slipper-like shoes laced along his calves completed the attire. </p>\r\n<p>"It is made from the shell of Dragons. Softened by the fires of volcanoes and blackened by their ash. It will protect you from the physical manifestations of Duman’s magic, to the extent that I have knowledge of it."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," Jarok hugged her tightly.</p>\r\n<p>"I have these for you also. Gifts from the Earth and from the Firstoak."</p>\r\n<p>She handed him a magnificent sword. A hilt of twisted ivory, inset with onyx, forged upon a blade of Henocite. It was light and perfectly balanced in his hand. He cut the air with expertise, spun the hilt easily in his hand and slipped it neatly into the scabbard that hung down his back. Next she gave him bow and a quiver of arrows. Again they were exquisitely made and well balanced. The bow stood to the height of his shoulders and was carved its entire length in a pattern of leaves and acorns. As he held it, testing the tension, the wood moulded into perfect indentations of his grip and when he let it go to sling the quiver across his other shoulder (so that it and the scabbard formed a cross belt upon his chest), it remained standing on its point until his hand closed over it again.</p>\r\n<p>Thus armed, with weapons, knowledge and Power, he raised his head proudly and gazed into his Mother’s eyes with confidence and determination.</p>\r\n<p>"I am ready,” he announced.</p>\r\n<p>"Then go quickly, for the time is nigh," she pointed to the pool that now eddied furiously. </p>\r\n<p>A tiny light rose from its depths and Jarok joined it as it climbed through the darkness of the Earth, through underground caverns and subterranean caves, through strata of clay and limestone, through sand and soil until finally, he broke through the surface on the outskirts of Talgheer to the objecting wails of the newborn infant leaving his Mother’s womb.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 22, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(31, 'Seasons passing', 'CHAPTER NINTEEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="T" src="T.gif">he storm persisted for two days &mdash; an unrelenting downpour of hail, sleet and rain that drenched the land to saturation point and beyond. The plains flooded. With no high ground on which to take refuge, Cymon and Alyse were forced to spend the entire time in the saddle. To Alyse, in her withdrawn, stone-like state, it really made no difference but for Cymon, deprived of rest and sleep, they were a long and tiring two days. Were it not for the risk of taking a fever he would have gladly sloshed through the thigh high water, just for the chance to stretch his aching muscles. On the third day the sun returned with a vengeance. The clouds that had previously hung black and heavy in depressive immobility simply disappeared overnight. Not even a whisper of white down remained to mar the deep-blue canvas of the sky. In the ensuing sweltering heat wave, the inordinate surplus of water began evaporating and to Cymon’s incredulous amazement by mid-afternoon, the ground was dry and baked hard as rock. The sultry heat of evening was blown away by spiteful north winds and there was a sudden and dramatic drop in temperature that covered the world with frosted icing.&nbsp;At dawn, the first flurries floated lazily out of the clouds and settled in a soft, thin blanket of delicate snowflakes over the Plains. The restful beauty of it was both deceiving and short-lived. They had travelled little more than a league or so before the picturesque scene was obscured behind a raging blizzard and Cymon was forced to call a halt. <p></p>\r\n<p>For the next two days they barely made any headway at all. Travelling in short fits and starts and spending the majority of the time huddled beneath the horses'' legs for what scant shelter they afforded. Even after the snow stopped, yet another day was wasted while the subsequent melts drained away.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon had never known the like of it and had he not witnessed it, he would have scoffed at such a tale. The cycle of seasons had gone crazy! The months passed in days... sometimes in a mere morning or a single afternoon. Surely the Mother’s grief over the death of Jarok... for that was when this strange weather had begun... must be great, for it to spill so physically into this world. His sympathy for Alyse grew. Her own grief must undoubtedly be on an equal with the Mother’s, yet because of the threat her Power imposed she was forced to lock herself away, unable to vent her pain. His respect and pride for her also grew as he marvelled at her courage and strength to do this, at her discipline in restraining her emotions and the fire that must surely be raging inside her... just as he marvelled at the lands'' ability to cope with the extreme conditions thrust upon it. In some strange way, the two seemed linked.</p>\r\n<p>However... as the freak conditions continued into their fourth week without any sign of returning to normality, his wonder and amazement were gradually eroded away by a bitter resentment and frustration at the constantly enforced delays. The looming majesty of the Anatols that had so lifted his spirit on the Ridge, now mocked at his lack of progress as they rose, higher and higher on the horizon yet drew no nearer. To make matters worse, one of the roans had developed a bad cough and Tielan’s black was limping from a split hoof, hampering their pace still further. So even during clement weather he was limited to a slow crawl... for he would leave neither behind. Though he tried to remain understanding, his patience with Alyse began to wear thin. Anger building beneath the surface because he knew she could heal them in an instant but constantly refused to respond to any of his entreaties. When thick fog rolled silently in from behind, it enveloped them in a deathly-grey blindness that caused yet a further delay, his emotions finally spilled over.</p>\r\n<p>"What on earth is the Mother playing at?" he shouted, since merely thinking it did nothing to relieve his anger. "I thought she was supposed to be on our side!"</p>\r\n<p>Royle rumbled a disapproving growl at his disrespectful tone and manner. Cymon glared back at him unrepentant, eyes narrowed and brooding in his dark face.</p>\r\n<p>"We should have been in Phelise days ago," he said through tight lips, his voice biting through the distance between them and cracking over the cat like a whip. "Instead we''ve scarcely come halfway. The longer it takes, the more dangerous it becomes. What d''you think will happen if Duman catches up with us while Alyse is in her present state? She stands no chance. Not only will I have lost Jarok and Tielan... but Alyse too, if I haven''t lost her already. Even Ecos can''t say if she''ll ever return to herself. And on top of that, if the horses get much worse I may have to make the decision to put them out of their misery." His cutting glance tore into Defiant without sympathy when the horse snorted his objections. "They can''t survive this weather injured and alone. It would be crueler to just abandon them to suffer and die slowly. So... all in all... I think I have the right to be just a little bit irritable, don''t you?"</p>\r\n<p>He paused for breath, though he continued his pacing, and to allow his companions the chance to comment further. They remained silent. He raised an eyebrow at each to prompt them, but both averted their gaze from his: Royle, by twitching his tail over his nose and Defiant by lowering his head into chest. Cymon nodded curtly, coming to a halt beside Defiant to untie the rope that bound Alyse to the saddle. He pulled Alyse somewhat roughly from the saddle and wrapped a blanket around her shoulders to keep off the drizzling dampness of the fog. He threw himself stiffly down, next to her, already feeling ashamed for taking his frustrations out on his friends but stubbornly refusing to listen to his conscience and apologise.</p>\r\n<p>Elf and animals sat in strained silence until the fog lifted. Whether it was merely coincidence or that the Mother had actually heard his complaint, Cymon did not know, but he felt his outburst justified when the following ''winter'' proceeded to be short and mild. Though it was still bitterly cold with heavy frost, there was no snow and travelling conditions were reasonable, so that despite their handicaps, Cymon was able to get a fair distance out of the horses. The following ''spring'' was equally beneficial. Pleasantly warm with a cool breeze that stretched into an easy ''summer'' and did wonders for the roans'' cough. </p>\r\n<p>Autumn came and went in the blinking of an eye to make way for a ''winter'' that, from its first breath, promised to be far less benign. </p>\r\n<p>All morning, as the clouds gathered thickly overhead, they battled through an icy-sharp wind that bit deep into the bone. Frost and ice crackled underfoot and hung from the horses coats and the reins slipped loosely in Cymon’s numb fingers. Royle snuggled deeper into his basket, out of the freezing air that made breathing painful. Then the wind suddenly dropped and they were cocooned in the silent, expectant hush of pre-snow.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon raised his eyes. The clouds hung low in the sky, layer upon layer &mdash; great vaporous ships preparing to unload their crystalline cargo. It boded ill. They needed shelter... badly.</p>\r\n<p>Though, inhabitants were few on the Plains &mdash; the soil was poor and the conditions hard &mdash; there were some dotted here and there, if one could just find them. </p>\r\n<p>But, which way? He stood up in the saddle. The best he could do was to take a guess... and if he guessed wrong... </p>\r\n<p>He let out a deep sigh, rubbing his hand over his face and chin. Flexing his shoulders and rolling his head to ease the tension in his neck, his glance fell across Alyse. She could have told him, he knew.</p>\r\n<p>''Alyse... or... Ecos?'' an idea began to form in his mind. But could he do it? There was only one way to find out. He closed his eyes and visualized the Dragonmark as he had seen it upon the Knights'' arms and concentrated on it as he reached out.</p>\r\n<p>''Ecos? Can you hear me?''</p>\r\n<p>He waited then tried again, this time putting more strength in the thought. Making it firmer, more confident.</p>\r\n<p>''Thou hast no need to shout, Elf. I am old but I am not deaf!'' </p>\r\n<p>As the Dragon’s amused tones glided into his mind, Cymon felt his body being suffused with a soft influx of heat that made him tingle from tip to toe.</p>\r\n<p>''I''m sorry. I didn''t know if it would work.'' </p>\r\n<p>''It doth take a little time to raise one consciousness above the other. Why hast thou called me?''&nbsp;Thou knowest the danger of asserting mine psyche in this union.'' </p>\r\n<p>''I know and I''m sorry but I desperately need to find us shelter and don''t know which direction to take. Can you point me the right way?'' </p>\r\n<p>The Dragon’s image in Cymon’s mind rose onto its hind legs and with a single, powerful sweep of its wings was airborne. The silver-coated, brown heads of the Plains grasses bowed low in awed reverence as the Dragon glided with regal grace above them. Cymon could almost feel the rush of wind against his cheeks as the ground sped by. The Dragon circled twice above a small farm before returning to settle upon the floor of Cymon’s mind.</p>\r\n<p>''Ride south and thou shalt find this place. Make thou haste, for mine Sister doth prepare to scatter the dust of winter. I canst feel the strength of Her arm... and it is plenty.''</p>\r\n<p>From behind closed lids, Cymon heard the negative tones of Defiant’s soft whinny.</p>\r\n<p>"Take me to thine brothers."</p>\r\n<p>As the words fell from Alyse’s lips, Cymon saw her features appear in the jewelled facets of the Dragon’s glistening eyes. He saw Defiant move to stand between the two ailing horses and Alyse’s hands stretch out to rest, one upon each of their necks. Still connected to the Dragon, Cymon experienced the pulse of healing as it flowed from Alyse to the horses. He felt a sharp pull, deep inside himself, towards the power &mdash; a yearning, a cry of welcome, the joy of a long-awaited reunion. For a moment he indulged it and knew the wonder of completion within his spirit &mdash; the filling of the empty space that had tormented him for as long as he had memory. Then years of teaching and self-control re-exerted themselves and the chains of restraint bound him once more, tearing open the wound that had been sealed and bringing a return of the pain... twice that, that it had ever been before. Cymon was glad when the healing was complete and the temptation to give way again was lifted from him. The Dragon’s head tilted quizzically.</p>\r\n<p>"The A''mathan is strong in thee Elf. Why dost thou persist in denying thy nature?'' </p>\r\n<p>''One Duman in this world is enough,'' Cymon snapped irritably. </p>\r\n<p>''Mine Sister hath long desired the return of the A''mathan. Thou art blessed to bring great joy to Her heart. Surely...? But thou art troubled and pained. This is not the time. I wouldst burden thee no further.''</p>\r\n<p>There was no mistaking the sentence was incomplete and the silent ''for now'' hung in the air between them as Cymon thanked him for his compassion and help. The Dragon sent a wave of acknowledgement. The image faded and was gone. With a sigh of resignation, Cymon opened his eyes. Time was shortening. The odd snowflake was already drifting in the air. He turned south and rode as hard as he dared in the icy conditions.</p>\r\n<p>By the time they reached the farm it was snowing heavily, the rapidly rising wind threatening a full-scale blizzard. There was no time for observing the polite niceties. Lifting Alyse from the saddle he carried her un-announced, straight into the farmhouse.</p>\r\n<p>"My apologies for barging in like this but... " His words fell short as his voice rang a discordant note in the eerie silence of the empty dwelling and the hairs rose on the back of his neck. Lowering Alyse gently into a rocking chair beside the fireplace, he gazed uneasily about him. It was a single room, with an area to the side curtained off for sleeping. From where he stood he could see two beds, neatly made with nightgowns folded on the pillows. Here in the living area, the ashes were still warm in the grate and the pat-basket sitting on the edge of the hearth had been recently filled. The table was set for three. Picking up a fork, he poked at the food on the plates. It was congealed but not bad. He poured some milk from the pitcher. It was still fresh. On the other side of the table was the cooking area. Like the fire, the stove was warm. The biscuits in the oven were newly baked, the water in the full bucket still cool and fresh, probably drawn that morning. The cupboards were well stocked with jars of preserves and packets of dried goods. A sewing basket sat open on the dresser. Someone was repairing a torn sleeve on a shirt. Next to the basket, a crudely carved, wooden horse lay on its side. A child’s favourite, judging by the well-chewed ears and broken leg. In the corner of the room was a beautifully carved, old chest, lovingly polished to a deep sheen. Cymon lifted the lid. More children’s'' toys were stored inside. Dropping the lid he looked about him again, shaking his head in bemusement. Everywhere was clean and tidy. No dirt, no dust, no cobwebs. No sign of trouble or of a hasty departure. Whoever had lived here seemed, not to have left... just disappeared. And not long since either. The whole situation smelt too strongly of Duman for his liking and Cymon would have preferred not to linger. But they had nowhere else to go.</p>\r\n<p>Far from happy, he lit the lantern, closed and barred the shutters and, leaving Royle to guard Alyse, made sure the door was firmly shut behind him before taking the horses to the barn. Here too, he found a similar situation. The door had been left ajar. Banging and creaking in the wind, it enhanced the spooky atmosphere that lay upon the place. Inside he had that same sense of incompleteness, as though time had suddenly stopped when the occupant had been whisked away. A set of harnesses and a bar of soap lay just inside the door, probably to be taken to the house to be worked on after supper. Next to them an empty pail sat on a milking stool. A half-groomed plough horse stood patiently in its stall. Beside the horse, a currycomb and brush rested on the pile of dirty rags where they had been dropped. A Man’s coat hung from a peg with empty hay net. A pail of water and bucket of feed were sitting just outside the stall, waiting for the horse when grooming was done. The door to the adjacent stall was still open. As he approached, a cow rose to her feet. Her udders full, she lowed expectantly. Cymon guessed she had wandered in from the field by herself and was waiting for milking. He patted her on the rump and closed the stall door. Disturbed by the noise he was making, half-dozen hens appeared from wherever they had been roosting. They wandered about his ankles, clucking and scratching the ground, prompting him for feed.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll have to wait a little longer I''m afraid," he said as he dragged the plough out of the barn to make room for the horses. When they were all safely in, he unsaddled and dried them and, quickly locating a barrel of grain, fed them all. He did his best to milk the cow so she would be a little more comfortable, then left both stall doors open so that all might share in the pail of water...&nbsp;since he could not find another. When all was finally done he went over to Defiant.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a bit cramped," he said patting the horses'' neck, "but at least it''s out of the weather. I''ll be back in the morning."</p>\r\n<p>Defiant whinnied and tossed his head before letting it drop, resting a hind leg and closing his eyes. Cymon picked up the pail of milk and pushed his way through the snow back to the house. He called to Royle before he entered... the last thing he needed was the cat launching itself at his throat as soon as he opened the door!</p>\r\n<p>Royle was sitting, poised and alert, in front of the chair. Cymon closed the door and swung the pail up onto the table. In a flash Royle had jumped up beside it, licking his whiskers greedily.</p>\r\n<p>"Manners, Sir Cat! Manners,” scolded Cymon, picking him up and setting him back down on the floor. Scooping some of the milk into a bowl he placed it before the hungry cat. Royle lapped it clean and sat back, staring from Cymon to the empty bowl and up to the pail. "Don''t blame me when you get sick,” Cymon laughed and refilled the bowl. </p>\r\n<p>Lighting the stove first, he put some milk to warm for Alyse while he lit the fire. Despite his coaxing, Alyse refused to drink it herself and he had to resort to pulling her mouth open and spooning the milk into her. When she would swallow no more, he put her to bed and set about finding something more substantial for Royle and himself. He sat back in the rocking chair, nibbling on dried, spiced apples and toying with the little wooden horse, and wondered as to the whereabouts of the farms'' occupants. Warm and replete, he drifted into a light sleep.</p>\r\n<p>The horse had slipped from his fingers and he bent over to pick it back up. His brow furrowed as felt the grass beneath his hands. He stood and gazed about him. He was in the gipsy camp. Eona was beckoning to him from the steps of her caravan. She seemed agitated, impatient for him to hurry. He was reluctant to go, knowing he must tell her of her brother’s fate. Her wave grew more urgent as he continued to tarry: darker now... her face, narrowed eyes... angry, yet pleading. He hurried over and followed her inside. The door slammed shut behind him. He called out into the darkness but there was no answer. He was alone. He tried to open the door but it was locked. </p>\r\n<p>Trapped! </p>\r\n<p>Cold and shivering, he curled down into the damp earth. Time seemed endless. His cheeks were wet... he had been crying. He pulled his knees up under his chin and continued to wait... wait... wait... wait for what? </p>\r\n<p>The question woke him. The fire filled the room with light and warmth but he found no comfort in it. He twisted around in the chair. Alyse slept quietly on the bed with Royle curled up against her neck. He pushed shaking fingers through his hair, kneading the tension from the base of his skull. It was just a dream, he told himself, and yet it had seem so real and when he breathed the smell of damp earth still lingered in his nostrils. He laughed softly at himself but it sounded hollow in the quietness of the room and too much like the empty sobs of his dream. Unsettled and restless he paced the room but this too only served to make him feel worse. He sat at the table and poured himself some milk. The fingers of his other hand drummed against the wood in flat, monotonous tones, setting his nerves jangling even more. He curled them inside his fist. The tension transferred itself to his foot and his heel began tapping the floor, making his knee bob up and down aggravatingly on the edge of his vision. What was wrong with him?</p>\r\n<p>He jumped up and opened the door for some fresh air. Beyond the whiteness of the blizzard lay the dark of night. The shiver that ran down his spine had nothing to do with the cold wind and snow that rushed past him into the room, blowing the shirt off the sewing basket and onto the chest. He pushed the door shut and slid the bolt. When he turned, his eye was drawn to the white shirt draped in stark contrast over the deep, brown wood of the chest. He picked it up. The material was coarse... rough... a shirt for hard work. He rolled it up and replaced it on the basket. Drawn back to the chest, he lifted the lid and rummaged through the toys inside and took out a small spinning-top that brought back memories of his own childhood.</p>\r\n<p>''Strange!'' he thought. ''No matter how different the Races turned out to be, children’s'' toys remained universal. Perhaps there was message in that somewhere?''</p>\r\n<p>He shut the chest and sat down upon it. Leaning forward he set the point of the top and pulled the bright red string, sending it twirling around the floor. He watched it spin, the painted shapes merging until they were just a blur of coloured lines. The top caught the edge of the rug. Unbalanced, it slowed... wobbled... and finally came to rest with a bump against the corner of the chest. Bending over to pick it up, Cymon noticed that the chest had been damaged. There was a small hole near the base. He thought it a shame (and somewhat strange in view of its otherwise immaculate condition) that such a lovely piece of workmanship had been left un-repaired. Maybe he could fix it. They were going to be here for a while and it would give him something to do to take his mind off other things he would rather not think about. Running his fingertips over the hole, his brow creased in a puzzled frown. This was no accidental damage. It was too uniform, as though it had been bored deliberately. Curious as to why anyone would purposely ruin a beautiful and otherwise treasured piece of furniture, he inspected the chest more closely and found several more holes, cleverly disguised within the pattern of the carving. His heart jumped... some sixth sense activated by his recent dream filling him with a sense of urgency. He tried to pull the chest away from the wall but it was too heavy, so he emptied out the toys. This revealed more holes in the bottom. </p>\r\n<p>Air holes? </p>\r\n<p>He redoubled his efforts but the chest still refused to budge. He searched for a lock or a catch, hidden in the design somewhere. The design on the chest was of a triple-point ivy interspersed with drooping, trumpet shaped flowers. His fingers traced every curve and groove and found nothing until, on the front, upper left corner he found a bee, hovering at the tip of one of the flowers. Double-checking that he had not missed any elsewhere on the chest, he wondered if could be the catch? </p>\r\n<p>"It has to be," he prayed earnestly and pressed the bee. There was soft click and the bottom of the box dropped down. The musty smell of damp earth from his dream rose up into the room. It was pitch black in the hole, too dark to see anything. He grabbed the lantern off the table and held it down. Something white splashed against the black earth. Getting no answer or movement to his call, he jumped down.</p>\r\n<p>It was a child &mdash; a little girl, curled up and unconscious, white as the snow outside... and just as cold. Putting her over his shoulder he climbed back up and carried her to the fire. She hung limply in his arms and did not even whimper as he laid her in the chair, covered her with a blanket and wrapped her freezing feet in warmed towels. At first she seemed to be regaining her colour nicely but as the night wore on her body grew hotter. She became red and feverish, calling out in her delirium. He changed the warm towels for cold compresses across her forehead and dripped cool water down her throat. For all his efforts she grew steadily weaker and with images of Tenora to enhance his fears, he knew he was going to lose her. Though it was hard for him to admit it (especially so soon after losing Jarok) perhaps it was better this way. They were riding a dangerous path and he already had Alyse to look after... he didn''t know if he could care for a sick child as well. If only... </p>\r\n<p>"Momma, please hurry! Where are you? Momma, please! I''m scared. There are crawly things down here Momma. Momma!"</p>\r\n<p>The child’s desperate cry filled him with shame and he gathered her close, feathering light kisses on her burning forehead.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s alright, baby. You''re safe now."</p>\r\n<p>"Poppa? Where''s Momma? I want Momma,” she cried between rasping coughs and began to struggle against his attempts to soothe her. </p>\r\n<p>"Ssh! I''ll take you to Momma."</p>\r\n<p>Not knowing what else to do he carried her into the bedroom and laid her beside Alyse, placing Alyse’s hand across her forehead. As he pulled the cover back up, he leaned close and whispered in Alyse’s ear.</p>\r\n<p>"She lives or dies... it''s up to you."</p>\r\n<p>Pulling the curtain closed he sat back in the rocker. Royle jumped into his lap, purring softly as though to assure him he had done the right thing.</p>\r\n<p>"I just hope she was listening," he said, rubbing the cats'' chin.</p>\r\n<p>It was a spring sun that smiled kindly across the Plains when Cymon led the horses from the barn the next morning. Ahead, the Anatols waited. Cymon gazed at them with set face and heavy heart. The child’s fever had broken and she was going to make it but to his dismay, she would not wake to his rousing. He had hoped Alyse might respond to the child’s needs but it appeared that instead of coming to the child, she had taken the child to her. He sighed. With a little luck they could have reached the mountains before the strange cycle of weather brought the next snows. Now, with two to care for, he might as well double his estimate. The lure of the mountains called to him. The sun glinted blue off the white-capped peaks and sparkled down the fractured, grey crags that melted into a multi-hued green just above the skirt of wild colour adorning the lower slopes. He draped his arm across Defiant’s neck.</p>\r\n<p>"Home,” he whispered as he drank in the mountains'' glory. He had always considered the Anatols to be at their most beautiful in the spring and this sight, still so wondrous even at such a distance confirmed his belief. He could almost smell the profusion of flowers. The exotic mix of their various scents flavouring the air so deliciously, he could almost taste it. </p>\r\n<p>"Fool,” he laughed at himself. </p>\r\n<p>His nostrils twitched under his furrowed brow. He was not imagining it. He could smell it... at least, he could smell something. His nose led him around the back of the barn. Again the breeze brought to him that soft aroma. It came from a clump of bushes standing a dozen or so paces away. He didn''t recognise them at all. They certainly weren''t native to the area. The child’s parents must have planted them there &mdash; strange place to put them though. He would have expected them to be near the house, where they could be enjoyed. He was about to move closer when Ecos'' warning repeated in his mind.</p>\r\n<p>''Trust nothing.'' </p>\r\n<p>He really couldn''t see what harm there might be in a few plants but he decided to heed the Dragon’s advice and err on the side of caution besides, he had enough problems as it was without inviting more! He turned and went back to the house.</p>\r\n<p>With Alyse and the child both safely secured upon Defiant, Cymon left the farm behind. He kept to a steady walk so as not to tax the horses, for he intended to travel both day and night for as long as he could, which meant the old plough horse (that had chosen to become a part of the company of its own accord) had no trouble making the pace. The days were long and the nights warm and it was as pleasant to travel as not. They covered good ground but each passing league mixed his already turbulent emotions further. While he looked forward to the prospect of home... of getting Alyse to safety and help... of being reunited with family and friends... he experienced a growing reluctance and dread of passing through the gateway. For then he would be faced with the inevitable confrontation with Mailon. </p>\r\n<p>The thought of the Elders'' treachery brought sickness to his heart and stomach. The elf’s name providing the key to the box in which he had stored all the questions that had first begun to plague him all those weeks ago. Liberated, they tumbled around his mind, vying for attention amongst all the other thoughts hurtling back and forth, making his head pound so violently he could quite happily have cut it off!</p>\r\n<p>''If it hadn''t been for Mailon,'' he thought, ''Jarok would still be alive.''</p>\r\n<p>And that was something else that had begun to nag at him. Something just did not add up between all that Ecos had revealed to him and Jarok’s death. By the Dragon’s own admittance, Alyse possessed only the tip of the Power that had been given to Jarok. Even so she was awesome! He had witnessed the way it protected her, warned her, healed her, as well as the incredible feats it had performed. Whether Jarok was aware of his own nature or not, the Power was there nonetheless. He found it hard to believe therefore, that such a magnitude would allow the boy to be harmed so easily... especially by its own hand, so to speak. Something was definitely out of place and he could see it even if Alyse and the Dragon could not. They were to close in their grief, he reasoned, to think objectively. If only he could get her to talk about it, to reason it. Where Jarok might be, Cymon had no idea but deep inside he had a strong sense that the boy was not dead. That was until everything else crowded back in on him and filled his conclusions with so many ''ifs'' and ''buts'' that he would have to start all over again.</p>\r\n<p>While the summer sun set for the second time, Cymon it watched with mixed feelings as it sank behind the jagged peaks of the Anatols in a splash of crimson and orange, leaving grasping purple fingers streaking in it’s wake to pull the midnight-blue blanket of night over the land. </p>\r\n<p>Lying back on the grass, Cymon closed his eyes and relaxed in the warm, soft quiet of the night enhanced by the unobtrusive chipping of chig-beetles. Cymon concentrated on their song, letting their unworried music soothe his troubled mind and wondered how they were faring under the rapidly changing seasons. Under normal circumstances the female would already have laid her eggs and the larvae would be growing fat on the ripening husks of the grasses.</p>\r\n<p>Had they time to continue the cycle of life before the summer was over and if not, would anyone notice their passing?</p>\r\n<p>Would anyone care?</p>\r\n<p>Would the Earth care... for the chug-beetles in their confused labour... or for the rest of creation should Duman win victorious?</p>\r\n<p>Or would it simply go on... supporting and sustaining whatever monstrosities Duman chose to place upon it, heedless of any but its own existence?</p>\r\n<p>Would it really have a choice in the matter?</p>\r\n<p>Could it care or not care?</p>\r\n<p>Did it ever care at all?</p>\r\n<p>"It cares,” Alyse’s soft voice close to his ear made Cymon jump. He opened his eyes to her sorrowed face and drew her close, holding her tightly while she sobbed bitterly. Finally, her tears spent, she lifted her head and gave him a tentative smile.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon, I''m so... "</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh!"</p>\r\n<p>"But my beha... "</p>\r\n<p>"Was quite understandable. I would probably have reacted exactly the same, given the circumstances."</p>\r\n<p>"You would not murder your own brother,” she cried, her voice breaking once more.</p>\r\n<p>"You didn''t murder Jarok," he said decisively, taking her hand. "I''ve been thinking about that." </p>\r\n<p>"I know. And I would like to believe in your reasoning but it is not so," she shook her head sadly. "We have searched this land and yours'' and there is no sign of his essence anywhere."</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps he''s concealing himself from you... as Ecos did from Duman?" </p>\r\n<p>"No,” the firm denial rang in the deep tones of the Dragon.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s eyebrows rose at the vehemence in the Dragon’s denial.</p>\r\n<p>"Jarok is part of us, as I am a part of Ecos. He could not hide from us," reiterated Alyse. "There is no doubt that he is gone. But what shall we do, Cymon? Without Jarok... what shall we do?"&nbsp;Cymon pushed the stray hairs back off her forehead and tucked them behind her ears.</p>\r\n<p>"Our best, just our best. It''s all we can do."</p>\r\n<p>"But... "</p>\r\n<p>"Hush now. The past is done. We must walk to the future... whatever it holds," he said softly, moving the two fingers resting upon her lips to her forehead. Their eyes met and held and in that moment their relationship changed. Deepening, as their hearts and minds reached out to each other with complete open and honest awareness. Slowly Alyse'' hand came up and she returned the Elfin gesture. Cymon took her fingers and kissed them, then bent his head to kiss her mouth. They smiled together.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m much too old for you, you know."</p>\r\n<p>"That depends," she teased.</p>\r\n<p>"On what?"</p>\r\n<p>"On which part of me you are talking to,” she laughed. </p>\r\n<p>It was a good sound. He kissed her again.</p>\r\n<p>"Mother is going to be most peeved. She had her heart set on Raenara."</p>\r\n<p>"I shall do my best to win her round," she said, lowering her eyes shyly and curling her lips in a smile of sweet innocence.</p>\r\n<p>"It may not be enough," he warned with mock seriousness. "Mother is not easily beguiled."&nbsp;Inner eyelids slid aside on blazing amber.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I shall intimidate her into submission," her bright tone belied the fearful gaze.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s deep laughter disturbed the sleeping child. Alyse picked her up, rocking her gently until she settled again.</p>\r\n<p>"How is she?" asked Cymon, brushing the girls'' cheek with the back of his hand. A small thumb came up and disappeared between rosebud lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Her name is Jerle. She is confused and scared but physically she is fine. I think it best she remain slumbering until we are in Phelise."</p>\r\n<p>"I agree. She''s been through enough already. My mother will look after her once we''re there. Which won''t be long now. Watch!"</p>\r\n<p>By now the sky was lightening. The first, searching rays of dawn cut through the receding darkness and, bouncing off the full, silver roundness of the still present moon, struck the gateway. It began to shimmer, tremulously at first and then with a bright radiance of pastel yellow, green and blue, as the light was reflected through the constantly shifting atoms that allowed passage between times.</p>\r\n<p>"It is beautiful,” breathed Alyse, her eyes shining brightly. "Ecos has memories of it but even they, for all their perfection, cannot compare or do justice to the reality."</p>\r\n<p>She had barely spoken and the vision was gone, leaving only the solid, grey mass of the rock of this world to be seen. She sighed and lay back, shifting her gaze to follow the approach of day. Suddenly she sat upright, tapping Cymon on the shoulder and directing his attention to the sun and moon as they sat on opposite sides of the sky.</p>\r\n<p>"That is it,” she exclaimed. "Eona’s vision! Look: the sun and the moon. The sun... it is far, far older than the Earth itself. Once it has risen, it moves all day without rest until it sets. And the moon... is a silver disc."</p>\r\n<p>"Of course,” Cymon grinned. "Just like the gateway. We follow the sun and wait for the moon to reveal the portal to the tomb. Now we know how. All we have to do is work out where to start. What we need is map and I know where to get one!" He sprung to his feet, pulling her up with him.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps we do have a chance, after all," she laughed excitedly and kissed his cheek. Not to be outdone, Cymon took her face in his hands and kissed her firmly on the lips. For now at least, the world was right again.</p>\r\n<p>Summer faded with the moon and the sun too, disappeared. Clouds banked overhead and soon they were struggling through torrential rain.</p>\r\n<p>"We''re going to have to stop," Cymon had to shout over the roaring thunder. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse nodded, opening a small den in the earth for them to shelter in while they waited for the storm to pass. As soon as it abated they set off again, eager optimism making them impatient to reach their destination. The horses were quite happy to gallop all the rest of the day. Even the old plough horse found extra speed, spurred on by the excitement transmitted from Alyse and Cymon. The air grew chill as autumn died away and night arrived on a winter frost. They barely noticed. Too fraught with the anticipation of discovering the whereabouts of the Crystal Tomb to sleep, they sat all night talking and discussing the various possible locations and were already on their way before the lazy dawn dragged itself over the eastern horizon with barely strength enough to thaw the frost-crisp ground that crunched underfoot. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon found himself gladdened by it, for the fresh sound had a satisfying quality that felt in tune with the fresh, crisp renewal of their optimism, determination and especially... their hope. So he was puzzled when, with only the last few leagues to travel, Alyse stiffened in the saddle and slowed to a halt, her profile etched with an emotion he had never seen on her face before &mdash; pure, unbridled hatred. He drew up beside her and drew his sword. A pungent, yet light fragrance surrounded them. He recognised the smell from back at the farm and kicking his roan forward began pushing through the long grass towards it.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon! Stop!"</p>\r\n<p>He turned in the saddle. Twisted amongst the hatred was intense pain, a backdrop to the grief that darkened her cornflower eyes to midnight blue. He edged the roan backwards until he was beside her.</p>\r\n<p>"The coppice?" he asked gently. "Plants?" he queried in disbelief when she nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"They appear as plants on both the physical and psychic level when they are inert. That is why I was not able to detect them in the coppice, until it was too late," her eyes brimmed with tears. Even as she spoke, the rustling grasses parted and the waiting Sectii advanced in a half-circle about them. Alyse passed Jerle to Cymon and dismounted. </p>\r\n<p>She knelt down and laid her palms on the ground. Eyes fixed on the approaching Sectii, Alyse began a soft murmuring under her breath. Cymon waited expectantly but nothing happened and he felt himself becoming increasingly anxious as the Sectii moved closer and closer.</p>\r\n<p>"Anytime now would be good for me, Alyse," he whispered quietly, instinctively hugging Jerle deeper into his chest as they came almost within striking distance. </p>\r\n<p>Tendrils whipped out, only a hands'' length from Alyse’s before she struck. Her eyes narrowed and the corners of her mouth turned upwards as the earth began to tremble, writhing, as though some mighty snake slithered just beneath the surface. The Sectii hesitated, clustered heads bobbing uncertainly as the vibrations travelled along their lengths. Small cracks appeared in the earth and (as in the coppice) the Sectii were quickly and firmly entrapped. They strained and pulled. Leaves dropped as they beat their wings frantically. But they could not break free. Alyse rose, slowly and deliberately. Cymon was shocked and appalled by the venom of her smile and the malice that dripped from her tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"This is for Tielan... and for Jarok!"</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, the white-frosted ground turned black as it spewed forth mouthful after mouthful of innumerable ants. Like black lava they flowed in a swell of clicking mandibles, up and over the Sectii. With merciless precision they cut, sliced and chewed through every leaf, every stalk, tendril and bud, until nothing was left but the thick, wood trunk and the small, poison sacs. Even the roots beneath the surface did not escape Alyse’s voracious appetite, though she made sure the ants left these till last, keeping the Sectii alive as long as she could. When it was all over and the ants swallowed back into the earth, Alyse turned to Cymon. Pleasure and satisfaction contorting the smile she bestowed on him.</p>\r\n<p>"Justice has been served," she announced proudly, stretching her arms across the scene of destruction. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon could only frown in reply. While he understood that in a way justice had indeed been done... the creatures having been subjected to a similar fate, in being eaten alive, as that which Tielan suffered... he did not care for the amount of enjoyment Alyse derived from the act. He tried to curb his distaste knowing she would pick up his thoughts but he was too late and she turned on him instantly.</p>\r\n<p>"Would you not also avenge the taking of one of your loved ones?" she demanded curtly.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, I probably would but I would hope I would avenge and not take revenge. There is a difference, Alyse. One brings justice... the other breeds a lust to destroy that often proves insatiable."</p>\r\n<p>She glared at him without remorse and then, as his words penetrated her anger and grief, her face fell and she collapsed to the ground. </p>\r\n<p>"I am sorry. I am so sorry," she cried from behind her hands. "I do not know what possessed me, except that seeing them again so soon after... I just could not control the raging hate. Can you forgive me?"</p>\r\n<p>"There''s nothing for me to forgive," he shook his head, dismounting carefully and laying Jerle on the ground to kneel beside Alyse. "I was just worried for you, for each time you step on the wrong path it makes the next time easier and in the end, it will only be you that suffers." He took her in his arms and kissed her tear-stained cheeks and then her mouth. "Right or wrong, I will always love you Alyse. But please, let this hatred go. You''ve been hurt enough by others, without hurting yourself."</p>\r\n<p>"I will try," she promised as he helped her to her feet. Once she had mounted, he handed Jerle up to her and then emptied one of their water skins and very carefully scooped the Sectii poison sacs into it.</p>\r\n<p>"If the poison remains active, we may yet be able to make use of these," he explained when she asked what he was doing. He shook the skin gently. "Duman’s weapon set against him.&nbsp;Has a nice ring to it, don''t you think?"</p>\r\n<p>"Oh! Most definitely," she agreed. </p>\r\n<p>Defiant added his neigh of approval and Royle rumbled from his basket.</p>\r\n<p>The last of the seasons'' greenery had withered away overnight, leaving only shrivelled leaves and brown stalks that echoed the shrivelling joy in Cymon’s heart. The welcoming wave from the sentry only made him feel worse. He was almost home... and he was dreading it! </p>\r\n<p>Unconsciously, he slowed the pace and finally stopped altogether.</p>\r\n<p>"At last,” breathed Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon turned to her surprise.</p>\r\n<p>"Did you really think I do not know what is bothering you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Then why didn''t you say something?" snapped Cymon, his churning emotions making him irritable.</p>\r\n<p>"It is not for me to interfere in your inner thoughts and struggles... unless asked," she replied tongue in cheek, reminding him of his accusations against the Dragon in the coppice.</p>\r\n<p>"Ouch! I guess I deserved that," he grimaced self-deprecatingly.</p>\r\n<p>"I would have stopped you, nonetheless, before you made a complete fool of yourself," she assured him in tones of over-exaggerated superiority.</p>\r\n<p>"Well thank you,” he replied with an air of injured pride. But he could not keep up his humour and a heavy sigh sobered his features as he shifted in the saddle. "I take it you think my suspicions unfounded?" he asked, stealing a glance at the gateway. </p>\r\n<p>"I know they are. Mailon would never turn traitor, nor do anything that would jeopardize my safety," she answered firmly.</p>\r\n<p>"And what makes you so certain of that?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because he is my grandfather!" She reached over and, with an amused smile, pushed Cymon’s jaw back up. "My Mother’s name was Sh''ailon," she expanded. "My father, a human named Kielton. They met during my Mother’s quest for the ''Eye''."</p>\r\n<p>"So that''s why she left," murmured Cymon, recognising her Mother’s name immediately. "Everyone wondered but she wouldn''t say. Strange, neither you or Jarok resemble her in any way," he observed.</p>\r\n<p>"I take after my father. As to Jarok... Sh''ailon was not his mother, merely the receptacle of his birth."</p>\r\n<p>"Not...? Receptacle of...?" he babbled his confusion. "Then who...?" </p>\r\n<p>"Who is the Mother of us all?" she replied bluntly.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s mind was suddenly reeling and he had to grab the roans'' neck to stop himself falling off and then Royale’s basket that he had caught with his knee. The cat gave a disgruntled mewl, too lazy to stir himself to do more. </p>\r\n<p>"Does Mailon know about Sh’ailon’s death? Of course he does," he answered his own question. "If he knows about you, it stands to reason he knew about her. That''s how he knew where you were, your father must have told him. But why didn''t he send for you as soon as your father died? Why wait so long? Why leave you to cope alone? Why send me so ill-prepared to protect you?" He stopped.</p>\r\n<p>“And why is my life suddenly so full of question,” he asked himself silently.</p>\r\n<p>“As to that... you must answer it yourself,” she replied in kind.</p>\r\n<p>"I was talking to myself,” he grumbled. </p>\r\n<p>"I know," she replied, totally ignoring his peevish glance. "I just thought I would help you along a bit. As to your other questions, you must ask Mailon."</p>\r\n<p>"Alright then, answer me this... If my suspicions are unfounded, who told Duman where you were and where we were heading?" Despite her assurance about Mailon, his doubts still nagged him.</p>\r\n<p>"You will not like it," she avoided the question.</p>\r\n<p>"It won''t be the first thing I''ve heard and didn''t like lately. Well?" he insisted.</p>\r\n<p>"You did," she replied with a patient smile.</p>\r\n<p>"Me,” he cried, unconsciously jerking the reins and knocking the basket again as he brought the shying horse until control.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps I should have him?" she suggested, when Royle responded to Cymon’s attempts to pacify him by mewling louder. </p>\r\n<p>"I can manage," he insisted and did so by dragging the blanket over Royale’s head to soften the noise. "Stop trying to evade the issue. Are you saying you think I''m a traitor?" he demanded in a hurt voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Do not be ridiculous,” she snapped impatiently. "Of course I am not. It was quite accidental. When you activated the Power within me he was able to centre on it. That is how he knew where we were. As to our destination, he has spies everywhere and more than once we had to reveal your true identity. That thing in the Mornay... it was one of his and it knew." </p>\r\n<p>"And where else would an elf go but home?" Cymon’s face cleared. It was all so obvious now he had had it pointed out to him. He slapped his forehead. He was such an idiot.</p>\r\n<p>''Exactly.'' </p>\r\n<p>"You''re not supposed to agree with me!"</p>\r\n<p>"I meant about an elf going home," she replied innocently.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon glowered suspiciously through narrowed eyes and then they both laughed.</p>\r\n<p>"Grandfather or not, I''m still going to have a few words with Mailon about leaving it so long and not sending someone more qualified to protect you," he told her firmly.</p>\r\n<p>"I would not expect anything less," she answered sweetly and then gave him a mischievous grin. "Of course, if he had done so, we would not have met."</p>\r\n<p>"Hhm! An answer for everything," he leaned across and planted a quick kiss on her lips. "I can see myself being led a merry dance if I''m not careful.</p>\r\n<p>"I am sure you are an excellent dancer," she retorted quickly. </p>\r\n<p>A sudden shiver ran up her spine and her grin faded. Her eyes drifted passed his head to a tiny speck in the eastern sky winging its way in their direction. Jerle moaned as Alyse’s arms tightened unconsciously around her. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s just a bird, Alyse," said Cymon, placing a hand on her arm and pulling slightly. Alyse blinked, drew her eyes down to his and with a murmur of apology to Jerle, loosened her grip. She could not return his smile however and the colour continued to drain from her face. </p>\r\n<p>"Come on. I''ll race you home," he challenged, trying to break the sudden hollowness of her mood. When she made no move, he slapped Defiant on the rump, kicked his roan after him and whistled the other horses to follow, waving to the sentry’s'' greeting as they galloped through the gateway. The sentry shielded his eyes as he turned them skywards to watch the continuing approach of the shrieking eagle, wondering what could have annoyed it so when it dove down upon its own shadow and raked the ground with its talons.</p>\r\n<p>"Missed your prey?" he called out in all innocence as his own stomach rumbled in anticipation of his relief from duty. "Better luck next time." </p>\r\n<p>The eagle turned its head quizzically, pinpointed the sentry’s'' position and then took off, circling for a while to decide the best vantage point and then settled gracefully upon it. Preening its ruffled feathers back into order, it settled down to wait. </p>\r\n<p>What went in would...eventually...come out!</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 22, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

She laid in her bed, staring through the window, her mind full of what she had seen. At first light she rose and made her way to the house of Chronicler Mawbek. Banging insistently on the door she finally brought the old dwarf to the window.<p></p>\r\n<p>"Surke? D''you know what time it is?" he called down in a hushed voice.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry Mawbek but I have to talk to you. It''s very important," she insisted.</p>\r\n<p>"It always is,” he sighed.</p>\r\n<p>"What did you say?" Surke called back.</p>\r\n<p>"I said, I''m on my way," he started to close the window, and then poked his head back out adding quickly. "Have a little patience, I''m not as young as you are." </p>\r\n<p>With muttering breath he pulled on his robe and hobbled down the stairs to open the door. Surke burst inside, quivering with excitement.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve seen it! I''ve seen it,” she repeated excitedly, clutching the front of his robe. He unlocked her fingers gently and straightened himself up.</p>\r\n<p>"Seen what, my dear," he asked kindly, re-knotting his belt. </p>\r\n<p>Surke was his favourite student. In her eight hundredth year she was a late starter and not overly bright, but what she lacked in ability she made up for in the sheer joy of learning. She also had an extremely vivid imagination and it was almost a guaranteed certainty that whatever she read, she would inevitably see something by the end of the week. </p>\r\n<p>"I know what you''re thinking," she told him as though reading his mind, "but this time I really did see something. I saw that Mark of the Dragon. Just like it says in ''Palach the Just''. Right here in Qipcha. It''s real Mawbek. It''s real,” she cried clapping her hands like a small child. Mawbek smiled indulgently.</p>\r\n<a name="Palach"></a>\r\n<center>\r\n<a href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Palach" src="Palach01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>"Surke, we haven''t got that far in the book yet, so how do you know that''s what you saw?"</p>\r\n<p>Surke reddened, twisting her fingers together.</p>\r\n<p>"I peeked at the end while you weren''t here," she admitted, avoiding his eyes by staring at the picture on the wall behind his right ear. </p>\r\n<p>Mawbek tutted, waggling his finger under her nose:</p>\r\n<p>"How many times have I told you about that?" he scolded gently.</p>\r\n<p>"Hundreds, thousands," she exaggerated. "It''s just that it looked so thick and I couldn''t wait to find out what happened. Are you very angry with me?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course not," he patted her hands. "It''s only your own enjoyment you''re spoiling," he reminded her. "Let''s sit down and you can tell me all about it."</p>\r\n<p>Leaning heavily on his stick Mawbek limped to the couch, his aged frame creaking its objections that it should be snugly wrapped in bed, and lowered himself down. He sighed with pleasure as the plump cushions eased the ache in the small of his back and tapped the grate with his stick... a signal for Surke to poke the ashes and draw up the glowing embers before placing on a fresh log and pushing the kettle across. It was a routine that she had become accustomed to and, without needing to be told, she took two mugs from the cupboard and placed a spoonful of honey in each, filled them with hot water and handed one to Mawbek.</p>\r\n<p>"Perfect," he sighed, sipping it carefully. "Now then. Off you go." </p>\r\n<p>He should have known better! For, indeed, off she went. Her mouth opened and like water from a burst dam, the words gushed forth in a torrential flood.</p>\r\n<p>"I was working in the supper hall. It was my turn you see because I had swapped with Aryta to attend that lecture on Ancient Monuments you told me about... she''s a hard one that Aryta made me swap one for two or she wouldn''t do it but anyway it was so embarrassing because the Conclave was just sitting and I knocked a pan of soup all over the floor and of course it just had to be Ludin and Grelka, what tyrants? Kept on and on about it all-night and made me so nervous I broke two more dishes. I don''t think the Conclave noticed those two though, they were too busy with... "</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek’s eyelids dropped heavily.</p>\r\n<p>"... ''Thwack!''&nbsp;It went right through the plate. Sorry, did I catch your leg?" she asked, as his head jerked up. "Anyway... ''That''s just a warning'' he says. Should''ve stuck him, I say. You shouldn''t say things like that about a person’s mother. Just as well he didn''t understand," she added thoughtfully, pausing for breath at last.</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek frowned and wondered how long he had been asleep. Oh dear!</p>\r\n<p>"Who never understood what?" he was forced to ask.</p>\r\n<p>"The Knight... never understood the remark about his mother. Mawbek, have you been asleep?" she frowned accusingly. </p>\r\n<p>"Sorry," Mawbek’s cheeks reddened above his beard. "I never got back till late last night. Just an hour or two ago actually," he tried to stifle his yawn... without success. </p>\r\n<p>"That''s right! You''ve been away on Fulstar, you don''t know about the knights. Bhulef took your place by the way. Did you have a nice time? I''m sorry if I woke you. You don''t mind do you?" she gave him a brilliant smile and then continued without pause before he could say either ''yea'' or ''nay''. "Only this really is important and I knew you''d really want to know straightaway... so anyway, next thing he swings the arrow straight at Fourth Kata Annuk. You should''ve seen his face! White as a sheet he went, shaking all o... "</p>\r\n<p>Intrigued, as he was, Mawbek held up his hand to forestall the flow. If he did not pin her down, she would keep talking till suppertime.</p>\r\n<p>"Surke dear. I would appreciate the shorter version," he smiled apologetically. "No offence."</p>\r\n<p>"None taken. There are two Knights here from Rohansuk, who want us to go and fight in a war against that Duman out of the book. Was that short enough?" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>If it had been anyone else but Surke, he would have suspected a deal of sarcasm and given a suitable retort, as it was he patted her hand gratefully.</p>\r\n<p>"Go on."</p>\r\n<p>"Bhulef took your place on the Conclave. Sorry, I already said that. I''ll jump to the end, shall I? Well, when everyone had gone... except the knights of course... one of them pushed up his sleeve and that''s when I saw it. Right here, on his arm," she traced the shape on her own forearm. "All gold it was... and shining. Horns on its head and a long neck and tail and open wings with huge talons like this." She curled her fingers into claws. "I''m not making it up, I swear. You don''t believe me." </p>\r\n<p>"I never said that," Mawbek denied to her back as she got up and walked away.</p>\r\n<p>"You didn''t have to," she turned at the door. "It''s written all over your face. You think I''m imagining things again." </p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t mean it to be and I apologise for even thinking it. Do you know where these men are staying? I''d like to take a look at this mark for myself."</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t. But I can find out," she offered eagerly. Surke was not one to mope.</p>\r\n<p>"Good girl, I''ll meet you in the library later."</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly amongst a race of soldiers, the library was considered of minimal importance and as such, was situated on the very limits of the city. Surke all but fell through the doors, puffing and wheezing from having run all the way and declaring vehemently to herself that she was definitely going on a diet. Holding onto the doorframe she tried to catch her breath, as she stood on tiptoe to stare over the heads of those present to locate Mawbek. She spied him seated at the far end of the room.</p>\r\n<p>"Mawbek,” she shouted, waving her hand to attract his attention.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh,” hissed those closest to her with disapproving stares.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, shush yourselves," she snorted. "This is important Chronicler business," and she threw back her head and strutted down the lines of shelves and tables to join Mawbek. </p>\r\n<p>"I found... "</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek laid a hand on her arm and shook his head ever so slightly.</p>\r\n<p>"Keep your voice down Surke," he whispered. "I''ve been doing a little research, here and about. The Conclave is on the point of voting against the Knights but if what you''ve seen is true, it could make all the difference. Don''t look now, but did you notice those two on the table near the chart chest behind you?"</p>\r\n<p>Surke nodded.&nbsp;She knew just about everyone that used the library and she hadn''t seen them before, she was certain.</p>\r\n<p>"They''ve been following me all morning. I think they''re Annuk’s spies."</p>\r\n<p>"Spies,” she exclaimed, then grimaced and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Sorry. How can you tell they''re spies?"</p>\r\n<p>"They''ve been reading that book since they got here and they haven''t turned the page yet." </p>\r\n<p>Surke giggled behind her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"So, did you find the men?" he asked her softly.</p>\r\n<p>Surke leaned across the table, all humour gone.</p>\r\n<p>"Sort of. They''re staying at the Flintaxe but were already gone by the time I got there. I''ve been chasing them all over the place but they always seem to be one step ahead of me. Do you want me to keep trying?"</p>\r\n<p>"No," Mawbek patted her hand as her face fell in disappointment. "I''ve decided to talk it over with Rhodka first anyway. “Come on," he reached for his cane and pushed himself stiffly to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Me? Why do I have to go?" she asked with evident dismay, even as she tucked his book under one arm and gave him her other to lean on.</p>\r\n<p>"To witness to Rhodka what you saw," he replied, then winked slyly, "... and it will look less like an official call with you there."</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka saw them coming from the window and, opening the door, greeted them warmly and ushered them in to the warmth of the fire.</p>\r\n<p>"Is this a social call or have you found something to explain this strange weather we''re having?" he asked, politely masking his curiosity at Surke’s presence as she placed the book on the low table in front of the couch.</p>\r\n<p>"Neither," replied Mawbek pushing the book towards him.</p>\r\n<p>"Palach the Just," he read aloud, stifling a groan. "Mawbek, I know how much this particular subject means to you and I haven''t forgotten my promise to bring it up with the Conclave when you returned from Fulstar, but honestly, this is not the right time. Next week perhaps?" he offered.</p>\r\n<p>"This is exactly the right time Rhodka," insisted Mawbek. "The Conclave might baulk at giving me money for an expedition to find the Heroes Tomb, but one and all they stand by the words written in this book." he stabbed a finger on the ornately designed, leather bound tome. Intrigued by the secretive shine in the old Chroniclers'' eyes, Rhodka sat forward on the edge of his seat, resting his elbows on his knees and tugging at his beard. </p>\r\n<p>"The wisdom of Palach is rooted in many of our laws," he answered guardedly.</p>\r\n<p>"Read it," Mawbek flipped open the book and tapped the passage he had marked on the page.</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka dutifully flicked his eyes down the passage.</p>\r\n<p>"Properly,” ordered Mawbek. "It''s to your own advantage."</p>\r\n<p>One eyebrow rose at the forceful tone from the usually placid and quiet-spoken old Chronicler.</p>\r\n<p>"I still don''t understand," Rhodka shrugged.</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek laid his hand Surke’s arm. </p>\r\n<p>"Surke here... " Mawbek smiled and laid a hand on Surke’s arm, "... told me this morning that she saw just such a mark on one of the knights."</p>\r\n<p>Surke squirmed uncomfortably under the First Kata’s intent gaze.</p>\r\n<p>"When? How?" Rhodka tried to curb his rising excitement as the significance of the information began to dawn on him.</p>\r\n<p>"Last night. After the sitting," replied Surke, keeping her voice calm and steady despite her nervous trembling. She could scarcely believe she was actually here, sitting in the home of the First Kata. </p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure?" demanded Rhodka, clutching at her hand and then silently cursing himself for it and for the sternness of his tone when Surke shrank timidly into the cushions. "Please forgive me," he smiled and released her. "But this could make such a difference. I have to be certain, you understand?"</p>\r\n<p>Surke stared back at him in wide-eyed silence until Mawbek gave her a reassuring tap on her knee with his cane.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure. It''s right here," she lifted her forearm and traced the outline, just as she had done earlier for Mawbek. "They stayed behind after everyone else left. It was my turn to clear away the hall. I saw the Mark, as clear as I''m seeing you now."</p>\r\n<p>She looked across at Mawbek when she finished and he gave her a thumbs-up. She relaxed.</p>\r\n<p>"But it doesn''t make sense," Rhodka frowned, getting up and pacing the room. "Why didn''t they show it to us? Maybe it''s not what you think it is?" he stopped to gaze down at Mawbek.</p>\r\n<p>"More likely they don''t know the significance of it. After all, it''s doubtful they''ve ever read Palach the Just. There''s many a dwarf that hasn''t either!" Mawbek could not resist the jibe, since the topic of making it compulsory reading in education facilities was one that Chroniclers and Conclave had argued for centuries. </p>\r\n<p>"Begging your pardon, but neither of you is right," Surke ventured with her newfound confidence and a raised forefinger. "The man said he had forgotten about it and then something like... It wouldn''t make any difference since they couldn''t waste it and you... that is the Conclave...would probably dismiss it as a simple tattoo."</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka threw up his hands and flopped back into his seat. </p>\r\n<p>"He was probably right, the majority have closed their minds on this issue," he told Mawbek, leaning forward and tugging at his beard. "They won''t give in without a demonstration. Let''s go and talk to Davin and Tynan." </p>\r\n<p>"Not a good idea," warned Mawbek, shaking his head. "I''m being followed. Annuk. He''ll be watching you too, and them no doubt."</p>\r\n<p>"He''s the last one I want to pre-warn. I''d like to spring this on the Conclave unprepared. The knights have today to try to persuade them to change their minds. If they can just get them thinking, this might tip the balance in our favour. There''s a Session at noon tomorrow. Bring your book Mawbek... and Surke too."</p>\r\n<p>"Me?" cried Surke incredulously, for the second time that day.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. If this goes how I hope, it will be a momentous event in Dwarvish history. It''s only right that as the instigator, you should be there to witness it. If it hadn''t been for your sharp eyes, we might have made a terrible mistake."</p>\r\n<p>"We still might," Mawbek reminded Rhodka that it was not set in stone yet.</p>\r\n<p>"I pray not Mawbek. I pray not."</p>\r\n<p>That same evening, Davin and Tynan sat in the bar of the Flintaxe, drowning their sorrows in Fellisan wine. Davin reached over for the bottle. It was empty.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, that''s it then," he sighed, a sense of finality in his soft tone.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you talking about the wine or the mission?" asked Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Both," replied Davin, looking every inch as miserable as he felt. "The bottle is empty. And so am I. You know, I''ve met some stubborn people in my time but these must be the most stony-faced, insensitive, hard-hearted and so determinedly blind and stupid of them all." </p>\r\n<p>The bottle cracked loudly as it hit the table. </p>\r\n<p>"Now that''s a bit harsh." Tynan eased the bottle out of his clenched fingers. "They''re not stupid. In fact, they were exceedingly clever in avoiding facing the facts."</p>\r\n<p>Davin burst out laughing, waving the innkeeper to bring another bottle and filling his glass.</p>\r\n<p>"To cleverness,” he toasted. </p>\r\n<p>"To Dwarves! May their cleverness, not be their undoing."</p>\r\n<p>"Even if it is ours." Davin could not help the taint of bitterness that stained his voice. </p>\r\n<p>''What was the matter with these people?'' he thought as he gazed around the crowded, smoke filled room. The bar was lined with those who had perhaps popped in for a quick drink before going home to their wives and children, as opposed to those who were obviously in for the night and took to the tables, plates piled high with food beside flagons of ale and bottles of wine. Calmly, without a care in the world, they filled their bellies and their pipes. Talking gently or laughing and joking like cackling hens while above their heads a cloud of smoke drifted as thick and lazy as themselves (for such was his drink induced opinion of them in that moment). He pursed his lips, staring thoughtfully from table to table, wondering how long it would be before the rings of smoke they blew with such evident pleasure became the rings of fire from their burning homes and cities. He tried to catch their eyes, hoping that somewhere within his own, they might see the danger they were in. Willing them to awareness of the horrors to come that had dwelt restlessly in his mind since the Dragon had revealed them to him. Some of the dwarves ignored him, some nodded. One or two glared in a manner reminiscent of Annuk, until his eyes narrowed and they looked away from his mocking smile. He picked up his glass, waving it in the general direction of the room.</p>\r\n<p>"Look at them," he snarled angrily. "What''s really going on in their minds? What d''you think they see, when they gaze at the world about them? I''ll tell you, my friend. Nothing! Absolutely nothing. Since, their eyes are blinkered so tightly, by their egotistical look-after-number-one, mentality. They just sit here, on their solitary little islands, cocking a snook at the rest of us. Well, they better make the most of it because soon, all they''ll have is each other. </p>\r\n<p>And when Duman comes a-knocking at their door, maybe then they''ll realise it''s better to be a little fish in a big pond full of other fishes, than a big fish in a little pond full of nothing." </p>\r\n<p>"Ponds and fishes,” declared Tynan with a raised glass, beckoning the innkeeper yet again with his other hand and wondering just how much it was going to cost him to get Davin to forget it all for a while. He never realised his friend could drink so much. The inn door swung open and a gust of fresh air hit Davin like one of Saroya’s sleeping draughts, along with that one drink too many from the fresh bottle. His eyes began to glaze over and a deep frown creased his brow as he tried to remember what he had been talking about.</p>\r\n<p>"Washa score, any... hic... ways?" he slurred, his eyes suddenly preferring to look at each other rather than at Tynan as he wanted them to. </p>\r\n<p>"Two to me and five to you," replied Tynan, deliberately misunderstanding the question and separating the empty bottles into two groups. The last thing Davin needed right now was to be reminded that the conclave was more than two to one against them with only five, undecided. It seemed ludicrous that the fate of the world was hinged on the vagueness and ambiguity of such an insignificant word as ''maybe'', thought Tynan as he gazed at the dark circles ringing Davin’s eyes and the drawn features and tight lips that even so much wine could not relax.</p>\r\n<p>"Not tha'' one. Th''other hic-score... " Davin’s eyes rolled up behind drooping lids as hid head slipped down his arm onto the table.</p>\r\n<p>"No point in spoiling a perfectly good evening. What say we get a good night’s sleep and start again in the morning when everyone''s had a little more time to think it over? It''s not over till the last arrows'' flown... and all that," Tynan quipped brightly.</p>\r\n<p>"I think thi-hic-thishish going to be the hic-shepsh-hic-shun to the hic-rule," returned Davin, stabbing his finger on the table and pushing his head back up to gaze at both Tynan’s. He hiccupped again then blew upwards at the stray lock that had fallen over his eyes... and quickly regretted it when the room started spinning violently. His head crawled up the side of the nearest bottle and he peered inside. "Ss... no harm-hic in trying, I shpose."</p>\r\n<p>"That''s the spirit,” cried Tynan, wishing he could feel as confident as he sounded, and slipping an arm under Davin’s armpit, pulled him to his feet and hauled him up the stairs.</p>\r\n<p>They arrived early at the Gathering Hall. Davin sat with a miserable slump to his shoulders and his elbows resting on his knees, pondering a wasted morning that would have been better spent in bed nursing his lingering hangover. He was also feeling guilty over the argument he had started with Tynan, having run out of patience with his friends'' irritating optimism. A guilt made worse since he knew in his heart that Tynan felt no better than himself and that the cheerful encouragement he had been providing had taken as much out of his friend, as his own brooding moroseness. </p>\r\n<p>''Damn these dwarves! And this whole situation!'' he cursed silently, dropping his head into his hands and closing his eyes tiredly. He felt a hand on his shoulders and turned his head toward Tynan, who winked as though nothing had happened.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t you ever get fed up?" he asked, shaking his head in bewilderment of Tynan’s capacity to withstand his own constant rudeness and irritability. </p>\r\n<p>"What are friends for?" replied Tynan obliquely.</p>\r\n<p>"That doesn''t answer the question and you know it," said Davin quirking his lips as Tynan’s irrepressible good humour began to seep through his heavy mood.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s all you deserve," quipped Tynan. "Now straighten up, someone''s coming."</p>\r\n<p>Davin sat up and turned his head, fully expecting to see the Members of the Conclave. Instead he saw an elderly dwarf leaning heavily on his cane and being accompanied by a female that looked somehow familiar. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s the serving woman from the other night," said Tynan. "The one that kept dropping things." Davin gave him a quizzical glance. "Some things you notice," he shrugged.</p>\r\n<p>"The dwarf is Mawbek," supplied Burtak thoughtfully, as he watched the pair take their seats on the adjacent bench. He tried to make out the title of the thick book the female had rested on her lap but she seemed to sense his attention and shifted her position so that her apron fell across and covered it. It did not matter. He had caught a glimpse of the double-headed axe etched in silver on the front cover and knew what it was. He nudged Davin in the ribs.</p>\r\n<p>"I think Rhodka’s up to something," he grinned. "Keep your fingers crossed it works and you might not be boarding that ship alone." </p>\r\n<p>Davin’s response was forestalled by the arrival of the Conclave. They filed in two and three at a time, the last arriving being Rhodka, who carried a tasselled scroll beneath his arm. As Davin watched him stride toward his seat, it did seem to him that there was a certain spring to the First Kata’s step, though his face retained its stony impassiveness. Having nodded to the other members of the Conclave and then to the knights and to Mawbek and Surke, Rhodka slowly unrolled the scroll. </p>\r\n<p>Though he had no illusions as to how the vote would be cast, Davin could not help the flurry of hopeful anticipation that fluttered in his stomach like the wings of a thousand butterflies. He placed his hand on his knee to still the impatient shaking that had overtaken it, wishing the First Kata would just get on and be done with it. However, before Rhodka could begin reading Annuk rose and pointed an accusing finger toward Mawbek.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s he doing here?" he shouted, his roving eye of disdainful conceit passing over the two knights on its way to Mawbek before returning to settle on Rhodka with intense suspicion. "Mawbek has no business at this Conclave. Bhulef has already been agreed as Kata in his stead."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m well aware of that Annuk," Mawbek ceded, drawing Annuk’s attention back to himself.</p>\r\n<p>"Then why are you here? The decision is already made." Annuk threw a gloating glare at Davin, who stared back with an unwavering steely gaze until Mawbek replied and Annuk looked away.</p>\r\n<p>"But not officially read, therefore it remains only a provisional vote. That being the case, anyone may petition the issue at hand. And so I do." </p>\r\n<p>"Pah!" Annuk snorted in disgust but it was aimed more at himself than Mawbek. The old chronicler was right and Annuk cursed himself for jumping in so swiftly, realising that Rhodka had planned the prolonged pause to allow him to do so. Holding himself aloof from the amused grins of his fellow members, he went back to his chair and slouched insultingly, one arm draped across the back with studied insolence.</p>\r\n<p>"Well get on with it then," he drawled in a bored tone. "Some of us have important things to do today."</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek was too old, too wise, and too amused, to rise to the blatant taunting. He merely shook his head, gazing at Annuk in sad disappointment, as one might gaze at a petulant child. Annuk fidgeted with embarrassment, then straightened to a more dignified pose. Mawbek pulled at his beard to stop the telltale twitching at the corner of his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Mark one for Mawbek," Burtak murmured into Davin’s ear then returned his attention to Mawbek who was already speaking.</p>\r\n<p>"Student Surke brought something to my attention yesterday. Something I think the Conclave should consider before the final vote." He beckoned Surke forward. She came self-consciously, eyes darting from face to face, to stand beside him and hold open the book for him to read. "But before I reveal what she told me, I want to read a passage from ''Palach the Just''." Ignoring the unified groans of more than half the seated conclave, he cleared his throat and began to read.</p>\r\n<p>The warning in this book I write of future generations’ plight,</p>\r\n<p>Lest time should pass and thou forget that which the Huri did beget. </p>\r\n<p>By darkness twisted and reborn: Elfin pure to Evil’s spawn.</p>\r\n<p>And with him... Death... for all that draw the Mother’s breath.</p>\r\n<p>He, who friend and race betrayed, in darkness shall await his day</p>\r\n<p>And on unsuspecting world arise, with mighty hand to claim his prize.</p>\r\n<p>Though ye be not the first to feel the force of evil, the touch of steel. </p>\r\n<p>Think not ye safe and smugly smile... for he will find you e''en on these isles.</p>\r\n<p>Mark me well: thou shalt not stand without Fellis, Elfin, Soyex, Man.</p>\r\n<p>For though in battle skilled and brave, none of this will Kata save.</p>\r\n<p>Thus on the eve when Duman’s doors shall open, look to eastern shores.</p>\r\n<p>Brave Dwarves... across the sea embark. Follow ye... the Dragons Mark!</p>\r\n<p>Alone... All fall. In Unity must Races come for Victory.</p>\r\n<p>A pensive silence greeted his oration and then an outbreak of surprised and bewildered muttering. Knowing his fellow members well enough, Mawbek allowed them to talk themselves out first before pursuing his argument.</p>\r\n<p>"Everything these two Men have been trying to tell you is here," he stabbed at the book, "written and foretold by the great Palach. Will you ignore the words of our most revered book?" he asked, taking the book of Surke and waving it above his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh please,” droned Annuk, appearing totally unimpressed though his heart was racing furiously. "Anyone can read. They probably concocted this whole ''Duman'' thing on this very basis."</p>\r\n<p>"You think so?" asked Mawbek.</p>\r\n<p>Annuk did not like the knowing light flickering in Mawbek’s eyes as the chronicler moved to stand next to Tynan. </p>\r\n<p>"And this?" Mawbek cried, pushing up Tynan’s sleeve and thrusting his arm aloft in a dramatic pose, so that all might see the Dragonmark. Amidst great gasps of astonishment, every dwarf, bar Rhodka and Annuk, hurried to Mawbek’s side for a closer look. </p>\r\n<p>Tynan was quite happy to suffer the insistent prodding, poking and smearing of wet fingers (just in case it had been painted on) to which he was subjected, in the name of success. His grin grew ever wider as, one by one, satisfied dwarves returned to their seats with a muttered aside to an increasingly smug-looking Rhodka. When the last had re-seated, Rhodka winked at Davin, got to his feet and opened his mouth. But Annuk was not ready to concede defeat just yet.</p>\r\n<p>"Very pretty. Dwarven workmanship if I''m not mistaken. How long did it take him?" he asked with quizzical insolence. </p>\r\n<p>"As long as it did to do this... " Davin cut in, his voice rising passionately as he revealed his own Dragonmark, "... and those carried by the others in my Company. Others who are, at this very moment, rallying and defending the people of Rohansuk as best they can. And as long as it took to do the one on the knight who has already given his life in this cause!"</p>\r\n<p>"You too?" Tynan swung on Davin in surprise, his soft tone falling loudly into the stunned room. Davin nodded. His eyes filled with sadness.</p>\r\n<p>"I never said anything because I wasn''t sure, but now... somehow... in here," he placed his hand over his heart, "I am." </p>\r\n<p>There was a long, respectful pause while the entire Conclave bowed their heads in sympathy. All except Annuk, who’s'' unpleasant laughter and slow clapping dropped into the silence like a bad smell.</p>\r\n<p>"Very clever! And superb acting!" He turned around to face Rhodka. "I have to admire your guile Rhodka. Throwing this on the table so dramatically, so that in a fever of excitement everyone turns their votes in favour. Very clever... and very gullible," he laughed, addressing his final accusation around the room and causing a ripple of doubts to spread in the wake of the possibility of truth in his accusation. He strode arrogantly across the room and snatched the book from Mawbek’s hand. Mawbek looked anxiously to Rhodka, who flicked his eyelids to indicate the chronicler make no protestation. Mawbek gave a surreptitious nod of acknowledgement. Davin and Tynan turned to Burtak for some idea of what was going on as Annuk flicked imperiously through the pages but Burtak only shrugged, he was as much in the dark about what Annuk was up to as they were. There was a scornful twist to his mouth when Annuk finally looked up. Rhodka’s earlier smugness settled like a heavy meal in his stomach.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not a Chronicler but as it happens, I too, have read Palach," he announced, running his finger down the open page. "Ah! Here we are... " His voice was thick with mockery as he began to read:</p>\r\n<p>“Dragon’s image... strong and bold, Power o''er the Earth doth hold.</p>\r\n<p>She and all Her children rise in aid of He, whom to Her cries.</p>\r\n<p>Mountains tremble, shift and quake. Ground shall grumble, valleys shake.</p>\r\n<p>Trees shall topple, plants shall grow... in this manner, thou shalt know.</p>\r\n<p>All creatures answer Dragon’s oath &mdash; those above and below. Both</p>\r\n<p>Obeying He, who doth them bid assist him &mdash; Evil for to rid.</p>\r\n<p>By this the truth shall be revealed... Authenticity be sealed.</p>\r\n<p>So let not Dragon’s form alone lure thee from thine island home.</p>\r\n<p>By Dragons MARK... with life instilled... alone, be Prophesy fulfilled!</p>\r\n<p>Annuk’s voice rang with triumph as he concluded, as loud and clear as any finely crafted bell. Davin and Tynan turned to each other in dismay, for they knew it sounded the death knell of the success that had so nearly been in their grasp. Annuk did not fail to notice their exchange and was quick to act upon it.</p>\r\n<p>"Well?" he sneered. "Aren''t you going to show us what it can do?"</p>\r\n<p>Davin saw the light go out in Rhodka’s eyes, knowing they were but a mirror of his own. The First Kata must somehow have found out about the Dragonmark and tried to use it to get the vote passed. Without this moment being forced upon them it might have worked but as it was... Davin sighed. He gave Rhodka a grateful but resigned smile. The situation was hopeless. No matter how desperate their need, he could not waste his gift on mere demonstrations. Tynan laid a hand on his shoulder. As usual, he was well aware of Davin’s thoughts and supported him whole-heartedly.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t," he agreed softly.</p>\r\n<p>"You all heard that,” shouted Annuk, flushed with victory. "It''s all a fake! This image has no power."</p>\r\n<p>A rumble of mixed emotions flooded the room: dismay, disappointment, disgust, anger, and accusation. A babble of voices all shouted at once demanding explanation. </p>\r\n<p>"I said we can''t... not it can''t," Tynan shouted angrily, jumping to his feet and almost pushing Annuk to the floor as he strode passed him to Rhodka. "The Dragonmark is real. I swear! But Ecos told us that his power is limited in his present form and it can only be used once. That''s why I said, we can''t. Don''t you see...?" he swung upon the disbelieving faces around him, "... we can''t waste it on trivialities. If we could we would have shown you earlier and given you as many demonstrations as you wanted. But we have to wait... until it''s really needed. You have to, " his voice tailed off beneath the weight of uncompromising hardness on all by a half-dozen faces and Davin’s restraining hand on his arm. </p>\r\n<p>"It''s no use Tynan, their minds are set. Let''s go home," said Davin, picking up his bow and starting towards the door. Giving the conclave one last look, Tynan did likewise. They were startled to a stop by a loud snort of disgust from the most unsuspected (and forgotten) quarter.</p>\r\n<p>"I never thought I''d ever have the courage to say this... " Surke, eyes ablaze, all but shrieked at the Conclave, "... but you make me sick. The lot of you! You''re the fakes here, not them," she pointed to Davin and Tynan. "Strutting around with your haughty noses in the air and wearing your ''positions'' like some sort of invisible crowns. Oh, we know you think the rest of us haven''t got the brains we were born with. Hah! Didn''t know that did you?" she laughed. "When was the last time any of you asked the ordinary dwarf what they thought? Not in my lifetime! We''re just here for your convenience, so that you''ll have someone to lord it over, run your errands and cook your pathetic ''suppers''."</p>\r\n<p>Amidst the cries of outrage that rent the air at her unprecedented behaviour, one of the dwarfs hurried over and grabbed her arm to pull her outside but the strength of her anger thrust him unceremoniously to the floor. She continued quickly into the doubly shocked silence, though she did drop her tone to a respectful level.</p>\r\n<p>"Please, listen, all of you. I never told Mawbek this, I didn''t think he would believe me," she gave the chronicler a swift glance of apology that nonetheless contain not a small hint of accusation. "But that night. I didn''t just see the Dragonmark, as the men call it... I saw it move! By Tacha’s Beard, I swear! It''s alive... just like it says in the book." </p>\r\n<p>"You just won''t give up, will you?" Annuk interrupted derisively. His question was aimed at Rhodka but it was Surke that answered him.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t tell lies," she said through gritted teeth, "and if you were half the dwarf that you purport to be, you''d have enough backbone to admit when you''re wrong." She grabbed his arm and dragged him, despite his protest, to stand in front of Tynan. "Look at it,” she ordered, pushing his face closer. </p>\r\n<p>Mawbek was not the only one who had to turn away to hide his amusement. The rest of the room waited with bated breath.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing,” announced Annuk with satisfaction, pulled himself from her grip and spun on Rhodka. "Read the vote," he demanded.</p>\r\n<p>Surke laid her hand over the golden image on Tynan’s arm.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t understand it. I saw it move... I know I did! I did, didn''t I?" She looked up at Tynan with tear filled eyes. He nodded and stroked her hair gently. "Why won''t you help?" she implored the passive Dragonmark. "I believe in you. Isn''t there something you can do? For me?" </p>\r\n<p>Tynan cocked his head at Burtak, who placed his arms about her to lead her away. As she moved her head, a tear fell upon Tynan’s arm.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, a ''whoosh'' of awed breath stirred the air. The Dragonmark had begun to glow. Brighter and brighter, the glittering aura pulsed as the Dragon’s tail uncurled itself from Tynan’s wrist and the tiny image hovered, a hairsbreadth above his flesh. Burtak swung Surke around just in time to see the many-faceted, jewelled eyes blink at her. The Dragon opened its mouth. A tongue of fire shot across the room and a tiny, golden teardrop appeared beneath Surke’s right eye. Then the Dragon turned its head in Annuk’s direction, blinked again and winked out, becoming, as it had been, a passive image upon Tynan’s arm. Surke reached up with shaking fingers to touch her face. It was there! It was real. She turned a beaming smile upon Tynan. For a heartbeat the whole room was paralysed in shock and awed wonder and then resounded to the exultant cries of ''Aye'' as the entire Conclave cast their votes in spontaneous unison. Davin slapped Tynan on the back, which in turn grabbed him in a bear hug.</p>\r\n<p>"One down...&nbsp;Two to go!"</p>\r\n<p>"Can''t wait," said Davin with a wry grin, then turned to thank the small, laughing group of Rhodka, Mawbek, Burtak and a dazed Surke, pushing their way through the throng towards them.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 22, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

In the small township of Groves End, two brothers, Sirs'' Danel and Alnac, were holding a meeting in one of the inns. It was proceeding much the same as many others they had held. They had told their story and delivered their warnings and were now in the process of receiving the usual reactions. The part about Elfin actually existing brought the predictable guffaws and Alyse’s union with the Dragon had half of their audience splitting their sides. Most of those still seated were really only there because they had nothing better to entertain them. But a few sat, suitably solemn and it was to these that they addressed their call to arms. <p></p>\r\n<p>"Of all the recruiting speeches I''ve heard, that''s got to be the best,” came a laughing cry from one of the less attentive members of the room.</p>\r\n<p>"A recruiting speech? Yes,” Alnac called back. "But not for the Kings'' Soldiery. Not even for Rohansuk. But for your future survival!" </p>\r\n<p>"Nice try lads," said a passing man on his way to the door, "but we''re farmers, not soldiers."</p>\r\n<p>"You won''t be either once Duman is done with you," warned Alnac. The man made an obscene gesture in reply. "Let him go," Alnac grabbed his brothers'' arm as Danel made to go after him. "He''ll find out for himself soon enough.'' </p>\r\n<p>The words were almost a premonition, for the next moment a blood-curdling scream rent the night outside. Grabbing their bows, the knights were the first through the door. The far end of the town was already ablaze.</p>\r\n<p>"You!" Alnac grabbed the nearest man. "Gather all the women and children you can find into the inn. The rest of you, arm yourselves quickly and follow us. Alnac and Danel did not wait for the crowd to join them. They ran swiftly down the street. Shock and horror met them at the far end. Grotesque creatures with saucer-like eyes marched through the town, weapons in one hand and hunks of human flesh in the other. Flesh upon which, they gorged with sickening relish. Those who tried to stand in their way were hacked to pieces with terrifying speed. </p>\r\n<p>"Dearest Mother,” cried Alnac. "These people don''t stand a chance. Danel! Give me your arrows and get all these men back to the inn." </p>\r\n<p>"But Alnac, I''ve only got seven left and there must be about fifty of those things out there," argued Danel. "You can''t... "</p>\r\n<p>"DO IT,” shouted Alnac. </p>\r\n<p>His older brother as well as the senior Knight, Danel was forced to obey. </p>\r\n<p>"What are you going to do?" Danel asked, even though the answer was right there in the fixed resignation on Alnacs'' face. </p>\r\n<p>"Whatever I have to," Alnac squeezed his brothers'' shoulder. "Go on, go. And don''t come back. They''re going to need you at the inn if these get passed me." </p>\r\n<p>Alnac ran off before Danel had the chance to say any more to change his mind. He took down the two leading goblins, which quickly gained him the undivided attention of the rest. They roared their rage as they advanced. Alnac fell back, firing arrows as he went, to the massive oak in the town square. He loosed his last two arrows then threw down his bow, pushing up his sleeve as he turned to the tree. He laid his Dragonmark upon the gnarled bark. </p>\r\n<p>"Power of Earth and all it sustains, let my call for thine aid not be in vain!" </p>\r\n<p>His voice resounded through the night.</p>\r\n<p>"ALNAC!" </p>\r\n<p>Danel strained against the hands that held him. Alnac turned and saluted, left arm now empty as it lay across his chest. Then he drew his sword and charged the surprised goblins. An almighty crack split the air even as it split the trunk of the great oak. The tree swayed and, just as Alnac fell to the goblin horde, toppled over and crushed all beneath its mighty weight. The earth shuddered as the oak hit the ground, knocking the men that held Danel off balance. He ran and placed his hands on the tree trunk covering the spot he had last seen his brother alive. The Dragonmark on his arm throbbed, winking in and out, beneath his sleeve. Danel set his wet cheek against the trunk.</p>\r\n<p>"Farewell, Alnac," he whispered. From somewhere he thought he heard an answering voice. A voice like none he had heard before: A sorrowful, sighing voice reminding him of a gentle breeze through long grass.</p>\r\n<p>''Brave and strong and pure of heart, was he whose life here did depart.</p>\r\n<p>E''er his sacrifice will long be honoured, in the Guardians'' song. </p>\r\n<p>Now set thee fire; this old Dame burn that she too may to the one return.'' </p>\r\n<p>The breeze continued to ruffle the hair on his bowed head but whatever else it might be saying was lost beneath the intruding, but well-meant, sympathies and thanks of the townspeople. Danel raised his head, leaving his tears to fall unashamedly.</p>\r\n<p>"This is but a foretaste of what is to come. I don''t want your pity, your sympathy, or your thanks. Let my brothers'' death have some meaning. Give me instead your courage, your strength. Come and join those preparing for the oncoming battle and give me hope and comfort that Alnac did not die in vain!" </p>\r\n<p>"What can do?" a voice asked immediately. It was the man from the bar. </p>\r\n<p>"Gather your families, supplies, anything that can be utilized as a weapon, they''re going to be needed. Go to the barracks at Chorley Bridge. The commander there will see to your training and some kind of accommodation for your wives and children." </p>\r\n<p>"It doesn''t take us all to look after a few children," shouted one of the women, stepping forward and pulling the axe from the grip of the man nearest to her. Those of us who have the stomach for it will fight as well." </p>\r\n<p>"Aye,” a number of the other woman called after her. </p>\r\n<p>Danel wiped his face and disbanded the crowd, telling them to care for the dead and then get ready to leave come morning. Taking a brand from one of the burning buildings he set fire to the oak. It was still burning as the last wagon trundled out of the town just after dawn.</p>\r\n<p>A number of leagues south east of Groves End, Velkaan sat on the stoop of a tavern munching hungrily on a meat pie smuggled out to him by a warm-hearted waitress. Resting his back against the upright, he had a clear view of the top end of the street and of the bar. All day he sat there, apparently dozing and occasionally begging a copper from a passer-by. Some delved into their pockets (usually the women), others responded with a generous kick or a swipe to the head. He thanked them all regardless. The moon rose higher. The inn began to empty. Velkaan had just decided to give it up for the night when a lone horseman trotted down the street. Velkaan drew his knees into his chest and rested his head on them, as though sleeping. Through the tiniest of slits, he watched the man draw his mount to a halt and hitch it to the post outside the inn. The man never even noticed the pile of rags on the steps as he strode into the inn demanding ale. Velkaan watched the man down his mug in one pull and slam it back down on the bar. </p>\r\n<p>"Keep ''em coming," he banged the bar impatiently.</p>\r\n<p>"We''re about closing. You''ll have to come ba... Yes, Sir,” the innkeepers suggestion was wiped away by the clinking of coins on the counter. </p>\r\n<p>Outside, Velkaan raised an eyebrow. It must be a tidy sum if the innkeepers’ eager change of heart was anything to go by. This one looks promising, he thought. So he waited, getting stiffer and colder as the night wore on.</p>\r\n<p>''The man must have a hollow stomach,'' Velkaan marvelled silently, having long lost count of how many the man had poured down his neck... and still seemed none the worse for them. But, as is so often the case, looks can deceiving and halfway through the sentence of yet another long-winded tale, his head finally crashed down on the counter. Velkaan watched as the innkeeper poked him in the shoulder and, when he did not respond, rubbed his hands together then swept the whole pile of coins into his apron. Velkaan’s lips'' curled in disgust. When the man rose from his drunken stupor, the innkeeper would no doubt tell him he had supped the lot. Suddenly the innkeepers’ head turned to the door. Velkaan closed his eyes quickly, a light snore rumbling in his chest. He heard the approaching footsteps.</p>\r\n<p>"You there?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan ignored him.</p>\r\n<p>"You asleep?" the innkeeper kicked him in the thigh. Velkaan grunted and moaned before giving the innkeeper a bleary-eyed stare. He yawned widely, smacking his lips.</p>\r\n<p>"Can''t be mornin'' already? Still dark," he muttered.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s not but you ain''t staying'' there all night. Make the place look a mess." He kicked Velkaan again. "Be off... for you feel the handle of me broom!"</p>\r\n<p>As opposed to the toe of your boot, Velkaan thought to himself, itching to give the man a little of his own medicine. But he got to his feet and tugged his forelock.</p>\r\n<p>"Fanks for the ''ospitali''y. Alright! All right... I''m gorn,” he jumped down the steps as the innkeeper brandished his fist. He ran across the street and slipped into the shadows from where he watched the innkeeper close down for the night, leaving the horse tied on the hitching post. When the last light went out he crossed back over and, clucking softly, untied the forgotten horse and led it down the street towards the stables. If any one should be about, he would tell them he was taking it there. He arrived at the stables unchallenged and moved around the building. With a last look around, he swung into the saddle and kicked the horse into a gallop. He followed the moon, being very careful to leave a plain trail until he came to a river. He ditched his rags for the clothes he had ''borrowed'' from the lines at the washhouse and turned the horse up river, northeast, to Symtar. </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan pulled his horse to a halt in the cover of a small stand of trees on the crest of a hill and looked down at the lights of the village below. He was tired and hungry but he had no money and a stolen horse. He would have to wait until the villagers bedded down for the night before sneaking in and taking what he needed. He had no qualms about doing so, since he never stole for pleasure or gain and never from those who had little enough themselves, he would rather go hungry. But if someone should have a little left over he would help himself to just enough to get by, justifying what some might call a ''twisted morality'' with the certainty that if the tables were reversed, he would be quite happy for them to do the same to him.</p>\r\n<p>He leaned his back against a tree trunk, reins looped about his wrist, and let the horse graze. No point in them both waiting. One by one the lights began to go out. Not surprisingly, those in the inn were the last. He waited a while longer. Once before he had almost been caught by acting prematurely and he was not one to make the same mistake twice. </p>\r\n<p>Finally satisfied, he nudged the horse down the slope and crossed the road at the bottom, intending to cut across field and come in from the back of the buildings. Suddenly his horse reared and sped off into the night as a strong arm came out of the darkness and yanked him out of the saddle. A hand clamped over his mouth, stifling his cry, and he was rolled into some kind of ditch with the pressing weight of his assailant pushing his cheek down into the earth. Stale breath washed over his face as he heard what sounded like ''shushing'' in his ear. Since he was at a definite disadvantage and rarely acted without calculating the odds, he did not resist. Footsteps padded close by their position. The hand on his mouth tightened until he was forced to struggle if he was to breathe. The hand was removed and he filled his lungs with the cool night air. </p>\r\n<p>His head shot up as a confusion of noise broke out in the sleeping village. Shouting and laughing mixed with screaming cries of terror and pain. The strangled yip of barking dogs underlined the frightened whinnies of stabled horses and blurred with the sharp crack of breaking glass and the ringing clash of metal. And over all came the roaring crackle of flames and the smell of burning flesh. The village was under attack!</p>\r\n<p>Instinctively, Velkaan tried to rise and help them but was pushed back into the earth with a harsh grunt of warning. Powerless to do anything else, he put his hands over his ears and tried to close his mind to the vivid pictures of his imagination. Something splashed onto his hand. It had a salty taste. Tears. His mysterious saviour had known this was going to happen and so stopped him from going there. But how and why, why just him, why not warn the villagers?</p>\r\n<p>On and on, the heart rending cries continued into the night. Velkaan discarded his questions in favour of praying to the Mother, that She would call those left quickly but whether this was to ease their suffering or his, he was not absolutely certain. It was almost dawn before the slaughter ceased and he heard the attackers returning in their direction. They were still laughing. He froze when they seemed to halt almost on top of them. One of them said something in a gruff, guttural voice and they moved on.</p>\r\n<p>There were few places Velkaan had not travelled and yet this language was one he had never heard before, even allowing for differences in dialect. Who were these strangers?</p>\r\n<p>These monsters, he corrected himself. He waited until his sharp ears could no longer detect their fading footfalls then turned to his unknown friend, his mouth primed with a demand for answers.</p>\r\n<p>"What the...?" he heard himself exclaim instead. </p>\r\n<p>As he gazed upon saucer eyes, fat lips and pointed ears, all topped by bristly hair on a stocky, muscular body with extra long arms and huge feet, he had a sneaky suspicion this creatures'' existence held less to do with the Mother than with a certain place called Ak''thai! His gaze drifted the way of the aggressors in the darkness. A tap on his arm brought his head back round. </p>\r\n<p>"Goblin ud noghe," the creature said, in the same, unknown language as it pointed from the darkness to Velkaan, then sliced a finger across its throat. </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan swallowed and looked toward the village. </p>\r\n<p>"Goblin fenud noghe." It pointed at itself and shook its head.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan had a flair for languages (a necessity for his lifestyle) and was quick to notice the change in word and nuance and the order of word and action.</p>\r\n<p>"Goblin?" he asked touching it on the shoulder. </p>\r\n<p>The goblin nodded. </p>\r\n<p>"Those goblins will kill me? Noghe?" he asked adding action to his words. </p>\r\n<p>Again the goblin nodded. </p>\r\n<p>"You not-me kill?" </p>\r\n<p>This time it shook its head so vigorously Velkaan was afraid it might fall off. He took one of the large hands. </p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," he spoke very slowly and with a wide, friendly smile. </p>\r\n<p>The goblin smiled back, at least Velkaan hoped the grimace that twisted its lips was meant as a smile and was not the predatory grin it more greatly resembled. He pointed toward the village.</p>\r\n<p>"I must go and see if anyone is still alive," he said rising to his feet. "See if I can help."</p>\r\n<p>The big, round eyes filled with sadness and dashed what little hope he had of actually finding any survivors. Still, he had to try. One of them might have been lucky. He ran to the now smouldering ashes of the razed village. Holding his arm across his nose, he dragged himself through the ruins with gut-wrenching horror. Never, had he seen such mindless violence. Even the murder of his family was nothing to this. Men, women, and children... all dead, body parts thrown and discarded everywhere. Dogs, cats, livestock ripped apart. What could not be killed had been burnt. Nothing remained but the fire-blackened, stone chimneybreast of the inn. Velkaan slid down it to the ground. He pulled his knees tightly into his chest and laying his head upon them, he wept bitterly. He felt a hand on his leg and opened his swollen eyes to find the goblin sitting cross-legged in front of him. It too was crying.</p>\r\n<p>"Ud brl." The goblins'' anxious tones were matched by the swift, running gesture it made with two fingers along Velkaan’s arm. "Goblins dukfeg. Brl... Brl!"</p>\r\n<p>"There''s something I have to do first," Velkaan shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>He searched the ashes of the inn for the cellar and when he had found it, began the unpleasant task of collecting the remains of the villagers. As gently as he could he lowered them into the cellar. The goblin watched curiously, and then began to help. When he had gathered all he could find Velkaan pulled the biggest bits of debris he could find to cover the opening and then piled more on top as a marker. When he had finished, he laid a hand upon it and whispered a safe journey to those inside. It was not much of a burial, for he had neither the implements or the time to dig a proper grave and perform the Rite of Crossing (and he never actually knew any of them anyway) but it was better than leaving them to the scavengers. With a deep sigh of sorrow he turned away. </p>\r\n<p>By now the sun was just beginning to top the horizon, its light weak and pale behind the shrouding clouds. The day looked far from promising and Velkaan felt a shiver run down his spine. For the first time since accepting Kreto’s bargain, Velkaan felt an urgency about the information he carried and tried to remember previous excursions to this area. But whatever the lie of the land, he was not going to make much progress on foot. He needed another horse, he needed food and he needed to warn whoever lived in the vicinity. As he felt the push in his back he realised another need. What was he to do with this strange creature beside him? Was it one of them? And if so, why was it helping him? Thinking his sudden frown was because of the cloth bound about its eyes, the goblin pointed to the sun and hid its face. </p>\r\n<p>"Vne chok," it said. "Fram solg," and it touched its eyes then pointed into the distance.</p>\r\n<p>It took Velkaan a while to figure our what it was trying to say. Then he realised that the sun hurt its eyes but it could see well enough through the cloth.</p>\r\n<p>"Ud brl," it repeated, pushing him again before turning to go back to its hiding place.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan scratched his head. Once word got out about what had happened here, this goblin (he had decided it must be one) would be in grave danger. The people would not stop to ask if were good or bad. They would not care in all honesty. They would simply kill it. On the other hand, if its own people returned and discovered what it had done for him... they would kill it. Of that he was sure. It was a predicament Velkaan had never been in before. Since the death of his family he had lived and travelled alone. No ties, no responsibilities. It had been lonely at first but he had come to terms with it and now it was the way he preferred it. But as he looked at the goblin shuffling through the grass, he knew it was a way he was going to have to change. He could not abandon it here alone. One way or another... sooner or later... it was going to end up dead. He owed it. Having made up his mind, he ran after the goblin. </p>\r\n<p>"Velkaan," he said, tapping his chest. "You...?" he pointed at it. </p>\r\n<p>The goblin shook its head. Several times he repeated the process but it did not seem to understand the concept of names.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, I''ve got to call you something," Velkaan muttered. He pursed his lips thoughtfully, tilting his head from side to side as he gazed at it. The goblin began to shift uncomfortably and started to inch away. Velkaan smiled. "No. It''s alright," he made his voice as reassuring as his could. "I wouldn''t hurt you. You saved my life. That''s it,” he cried snapping his fingers. "I''ll call you Sula. That means lucky in Soyex. Velkaan... Sula," he tapped himself and then the goblin. "Velkaan...&nbsp;Sula. Velkaan and Sula go together, he nodded and smiled, running two fingers of each hand side by side. He took the goblins'' hand and started walking. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately for Velkaan he knew absolutely nothing about goblins, not surprising since this was his first encounter with one. Even more unfortunate for him was the fact that this one was the female whose mother had beat it for asking questions. Knowing she was under sentence of death if a mate did not choose her soon and knowing that every male her parents had approached considered her too soft and weak-blooded, she had taken advantage of the opening of the tunnels to run away. One, to stay alive and two, because she was intensely curious about those who lived above and why they were her enemy when, as far as she knew, none had ever done anything to any goblin. So, she was an un-mated female and this was why she had been unable to tell Velkaan her name. Not because she did not understand what he was asking... but because she did not have one.</p>\r\n<p>This being known, the reader will understand the reason for the newly named (and mated) Sula’s unbridled delight. Velkaan unfortunately remained totally ignorant of these facts and was both bemused and dismayed, not to mention extremely embarrassed, by the effusive bear hug that almost crushed his ribs and the subsequent falling to her knees and kissing of his ankles. Had he realised his error, Velkaan might well have made a run for it but as it was, he mistook her behaviour for gratitude that he was not leaving her behind and pulled her gently to her feet. Taking her hand with a friendly smile (that only reinforced the goblins'' misconceptions) he urged her into a run.</p>\r\n<p>They managed to keep up a good, steady pace all morning. Sula’s stamina was more than making up for her short legs. Velkaan was more than pleased with the distance they had covered and so, when they came to a deep hollow, thick with brambles, he decided to stop to rest and eat. Velkaan leaned carefully into the middle of the dense patch of thorny brambles, to where the berries were large and ripe. Unfortunately they were also well out of his reach. The outside branches had already been stripped bare and Velkaan could only stare in stomach-growling disappointment at the juicy, black berries so mouth-wateringly close. He had not eaten since the previous day and hunger urged him to try again but he received only a handful of scratches for his effort and dropped to the ground to pull the tiny thorns from his flesh with his teeth and suck away the blood.</p>\r\n<p>Sula was fascinated. She had never seen brambles before and had no idea what they were or what Velkaan was trying to do. She copied his actions, thrusting her long arm across the trailing shoots and bringing it back empty, since she did not know she was supposed to pick the berries. She grunted, seeing no point to the exercise. Velkaan looked up. </p>\r\n<p>"The berries," he said jumping to his feet. "Take the berries."</p>\r\n<p>"Brys?" she shrugged, brow creasing beneath its cloth. She had dropped the vowels but Velkaan recognised her attempt to say the word. He searched the outer branches for an overlooked fruit. He found one, half eaten and shrivelled but a good enough example for his purpose.</p>\r\n<p>"Brys," he said, imitating her pronunciation as he held it up for her and pointed to those still on the bush, bloated with juices. "Brys," he repeated, rubbing his stomach and plastering a silly grin on his face. "Mm! Solg."</p>\r\n<p>"Brys solg,” she cried, dropping the berry Velkaan had placed in her palm and jumping back in alarm. Velkaan laughed. Obviously the word did not mean what he thought. He tried again.</p>\r\n<p>"Brys Fram?" This time he made it a question hoping she would realise that his first effort had been a mistake. "Brys good. Mmm." He pretended to pop one in his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"Brys gud ved! Fen solg,” she laughed, a soft flush of red staining her cheeks. "Uck ved Brys?"</p>\r\n<p>"More than anything," he answered hungrily, hoping she was offering. </p>\r\n<p>Ignoring the vicious thorns, Sula thrust the obstructing branches aside and strode into the middle of the patch. Plucking the largest berries she could find, she tossed them over to Velkaan. He motioned to her to try one. She looked at it warily before slowly placing it on her tongue and closing her mouth. With the cloth wrapped about her eyes it was difficult to gauge her initial reaction as the sweet juices erupted in her mouth but when she began picking one for one Velkaan knew she liked them. Suddenly her long arm snaked downward. Velkaan heard a squeak of terror and then Sula lifted her arm triumphantly holding a squirming Darkpad in her hand. The terrified rat was almost in her mouth before Velkaan realised what she was about to do.</p>\r\n<p>"Fen,” he shouted in alarm.</p>\r\n<p>Sula paused and turned guiltily, expecting punishment. She had forgotten she was now a mate and should have offered the food to Velkaan first. She walked over to him and knelt with her head bowed at his feet, holding Darkpad aloft for him to take. Gently, Velkaan released him from her fingers. His heart was racing and he shook alarmingly...but he was still alive... thank the Mother. He did not relish, trying to explain to Kretos, why they had eaten one of his family. </p>\r\n<p>Sula waited patiently for the inevitable cuff of displeasure. Instead, she was surprised by Velkaan, dropping to his knees beside her, gently placing his fingers beneath her chin and lifting her head. She looked up confused and was even more so to find the rat still in one piece and sitting on his shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t eat him," said Velkaan, slowly shaking his head. "Fen ved." </p>\r\n<p>"Fen ved?" frowned Sula. She sniffed at Darkpad, then smiled and nodded vigorously. "Pokut fram! Gud... mmm," she mimicked his belly rubbing.</p>\r\n<p>"Pokut?" he asked, pointing to Darkpad.</p>\r\n<p>"Pokut." she nodded. "Obfram ved."</p>\r\n<p>"Very good, huh?" guessed Velkaan and then waved his finger from side to side.</p>\r\n<p>"Fen ved?" Sula almost wailed in disappointment as her face dropped. "Vy? Vy fen ved?"</p>\r\n<p>Sula was very confused. There was nothing wrong with the rat. It was fresh and healthy. It was perfectly good food, not to mention her favourite. Velkaan scratched his head, trying to work out how to explain. He waved his hand between the two of them.</p>\r\n<p>"Velkaan...Sula, friends," he smiled broadly.</p>\r\n<p>"Sla frind," she nodded enthusiastically in agreement.</p>\r\n<p>"Velkaan... Darkpad," he stroked the rat, "...friends. Fen ved friend." </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan smiled to himself when Sula did not argue, satisfied that she had understood. He might have been less pleased with himself had been able to read Sula’s thoughts. The poor goblin was completely bewildered. Beneath the cloth her brow was deeply furrowed. </p>\r\n<p>What strange creatures were these humans? </p>\r\n<p>How could they have more than one mate? </p>\r\n<p>And why did they mate with their food? </p>\r\n<p>He must be speaking wrongly but she could see his broad smile and the way that he stroked the rat with his fingers. </p>\r\n<p>Was he mad? He didn''t seem to be. </p>\r\n<p>But then how would she know? </p>\r\n<p>She really did not understand at all. </p>\r\n<p>Later, the two of them would laugh about this but for now though, Sula suffered in miserable bewilderment as she accepted his word as her mate. He must surely have his reasons for this weird and, to her mind, unwholesome custom but it was not for her to question him &mdash; only to obey. Swallowing the saliva that the prospect of eating Darkpad’s juicy meat had created, she lifted him from Velkaan’s shoulder and released him with a sigh of disappointment as he scurried into the questionable safety of the thicket.</p>\r\n<p>They travelled by day and hid by night. Velkaan wrapped Sula in his cloak whenever they came near habitation. With the hood up over her covered eyes and her long arms hidden within its folds, she was able to pass without too much comment so long as she kept well in the background and did not speak. Thankfully she seemed content to do as she was told.</p>\r\n<p>Each day Velkaan worked on the language barrier. It was not easy. Many things, especially plants and animals, she had never seen before. Rocks, stones and, to his surprise, weapons, she seemed to possess a knowledgeable and descriptive vocabulary for. Food was an adventure in itself. Beetles, worms and all things crawly she appeared to enjoy immensely as well as all kinds of meat as long as it was raw. To his relief she settled quite happily to pork and chicken once she had accepted that all rodents, not just Darkpad, were taboo. Velkaan had been undecided as to mice when she had first come up with one. Would a mouse be ''one of the family'' as far as Kretos was concerned? The squeak of alarm from the Darkpad as she laid it across her tongue seemed to confirm that it was and he grabbed the mouse by its tail saving it by a whisker, quite literally, from the jaws of death.</p>\r\n<p>"Distant cousin,” he shrugged with a wry grin.</p>\r\n<p>"Fen?" she asked in disappointment.</p>\r\n<p>"''Fraid so," he nodded.</p>\r\n<p>Berries, root vegetables, fungi and bread she condescended to eat if there was nothing else and she was hungry but cheese, milk and eggs she spat out in disgust and refused vehemently. Gradually, beginning with the words for these objects... food and clothing... and progressing slowly and often hilariously, to more difficult areas such as emotions and senses, they managed to establish a workable, if unusual form of communication.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the slowness of their pace they remained on foot even though they had passed a number of small villages and farms. The people had been poor and struggling and so apart from requesting the odd bit of food Velkaan took nothing. Then one evening, just after dusk, as they were looking for a possible campsite, they heard noises. Velkaan kept well back until Sula’s incredible eyesight had ascertained they were coming from a group of humans and not goblins. He told Sula to conceal herself in the cloak and to keep quiet.</p>\r\n<p>"Halt! Who goes there?" cried a voice as they approached.</p>\r\n<p>"Friend,” Velkaan called back.</p>\r\n<p>"Come and be recognised," ordered the man.</p>\r\n<p>Sula did not move. More mates? Her confused brain began working overtime. Velkaan’s hand on the front of the cloak yanked her forward and she almost tripped over its length.</p>\r\n<p>"What wrong?" whispered Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>"Frinds?" </p>\r\n<p>"Let''s hope so,” replied Velkaan, to her dismay, and stepped forward. "Am I glad to see you," breathed Velkaan in relief, holding out his hand to the man confronting him.</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" asked the man, his tone suspicious but not too unfriendly.</p>\r\n<p>"Hawk. My name''s Hawk," lied Velkaan. "Who are you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Ansuk militia. We''re patrolling this area."</p>\r\n<p>"Just the people," smiled Velkaan, hiding his surprise. "I''m third company, Middle Province, on important business to Symtar. I need a horse and provisions. Where''s your Captain?"</p>\r\n<p>"Who''s that?" asked the man pointing at Sula with his spear.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah,” whispered Velkaan tapping the side of his nose. "Your Captain?"</p>\r\n<p>"We don''t actually have one but Tanner''s in charge. He''s over yonder."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," said Velkaan and strode off to where a group of men sat huddled in a tight group. "Tanner?"</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you and how did you get through?" demanded the rough voice of an equally rough-looking man.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve already been through all this," Velkaan laced his tone with bored impatience. "Hawk. Third Company. Middle Province. Important business in Symtar."</p>\r\n<p>"There''s no third company from Middle Province," said Tanner jumping to his feet and drawing his sword, using the point to flick back Sula’s hood. "What the...? Spies,” he shouted and armed guards immediately surrounded Velkaan and Sula.</p>\r\n<p>"Honestly,” laughed Velkaan. "Would I walk in unarmed, with this in tow if I were a spy? Give me some credit! I''ll admit the Middle Province militia hasn''t been in place long, that''s probably why you haven''t heard of us yet, but we''re growing. Now, if I may speak with you privately."&nbsp;He dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper as he took a half step closer to Tanner. Tanner eyed him warily but the lure of being singled out as one of importance was too much to resist and he motioned the others to withdraw. Velkaan crouched down and pulled the note Kretos had given him from his pocket. "Do you read?" he asked, noting the hesitation before Tanner, in an offended tone, insisted he could. When the man opened the parchment and held it upside-down, Velkaan knew his suspicions were correct. He gave an inward smile. This was too easy!</p>\r\n<p>"As you can see by the er...militia seal," he began, tapping a smudged fingerprint Kretos had left on the parchment, "... this is quite official. It gives me clear passage with all necessary assistance from all groups I encounter."</p>\r\n<p>"Mmm," muttered Tanner turning the parchment over. "What''s this?"</p>\r\n<p>"Ah, now you shouldn''t really have looked at that," replied Velkaan quickly re-folding it and putting it back in his pocket. "But I suppose it''ll be alright...&nbsp;you being in charge and all." He leaned closer; speaking so softly Tanner could hardly hear. "It''s a battle plan. For the</p>\r\n<p>Kings'' approval."</p>\r\n<p>Tanners'' eyes widened and he nodded slowly. Velkaan cleared his throat, covering his mouth with his hand until he could control his grin. Mother, help them, if this was all they could muster!</p>\r\n<p>"Well, now you know most of it, I may as well tell you the rest. We managed to capture this one and I''ve been ordered to get it to Symtar for interrogation. My horse broke a leg two days ago and I need a replacement. I''m in a great hurry," he prompted as Tanners'' eyes narrowed, darting from one to other of them.</p>\r\n<p>"If it''s a prisoner, why isn''t it tied up?"</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps he wasn''t as stupid as he looked, Velkaan thought to himself. Then again... </p>\r\n<p>"Drugged," he said calmly. "Easier to handle that way. Nasty things these, you know. Now, about that horse?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course," replied Tanner, satisfied by Velkaan’s explanation. "When d''you want it?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan wanted to get away from this group as quickly as he could. Aside from being discovered in his deceit, he would rather not be around should trouble find them. He had an idea that they would be a hindrance rather than help in any battle. He might be wrong... he hoped so for their sake... but he doubted it.</p>\r\n<p>"Straightaway," he gave Tanner a weary look. "Got a lot of time to make up." </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan hid his disappointment at the sight of the lumbering plough horse. He had hoped for something with a little more speed. Still it was quicker than walking... till something better came along... and this one did come supplied with a bedroll and pack of food. He thanked Tanner, helped Sula aboard and left the group as quickly as manners would allow. When they were safely out of earshot, Sula tapped Velkaan on the shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"Sla not gud speak but lurn fast," she said, a note of puzzlement in her voice. "Velkn tell lot, not-truths. Vy?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan blew out a deep breath.</p>\r\n<p>"We needed a horse, they had one spare. It was the only way to get it," he tried to explain as simply as he could.</p>\r\n<p>"Vy tell Sla not-nice. Nasty." She grunted and spat and Velkaan knew her face would be screwed up too, remembering her reaction to the cheese he had offered and using it to teach her the word ''nasty''. He could tell she was upset by him saying this about her, by the stiffness in her arms about his waist.</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry about that," he patted one of her hands. "But they would have killed you."</p>\r\n<p>"But Sla frind! Fen noghe frind, Velkn tell Sla."</p>\r\n<p>"They wouldn''t have believed me." Velkaan heard her gasp of surprise.</p>\r\n<p>"Not gud... frind argu frind. Bad frind. Noghe," she drew her finger across her throat. </p>\r\n<p>She had been utterly confused that Velkaan appeared to have so many mates. To discover that these were also males was beyond her reasoning. That they would kill the female mate of their mate, without his consent, even more so. Something was definitely not right. </p>\r\n<p>"Sla not see," she sighed in defeat.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll get there," Velkaan tried to reassure her. "You''re clever. You''ve already learnt a lot. You can''t rush these things you know."</p>\r\n<p>"Hab ''cleva''? Is gud?" she asked eagerly.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan laughed. She so loved to be praised.</p>\r\n<p>"Is gud. Cleva is... fast... here," he tapped his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah! Abek. Sla abek?"</p>\r\n<p>"Much," he told her firmly. </p>\r\n<p>She seemed so surprised at this that Velkaan wondered about her people and her previous life that it had left her with such low self-esteem. Still he was working on that and her confidence was building nicely. Strange as she was, Velkaan was developing a strong liking for this strange looking goblin &mdash; as with Kretos, he sensed something inside so at odds with her outward appearance of ugliness. He had met many others of his own kind that were ugly through and through.</p>\r\n<p>They rode for much of the night. Sula assuring him there were no goblins in this area. As days went by however she grew increasingly anxious by the number of telltale signs. The increasing lack of wildlife on the ground, the eerie quietness of the night that was enhanced by the haunting hoots of owls in the darkness, scraped out hollows where something had hidden...&nbsp;goblins perhaps seeking escape from the bright sunlight of day, discarded bones, broken, so that the juicy marrow inside could be reached easily. Skulls sucked dry of their contents. Her uneasiness was affirmed when they arrived at a burnt out farm. Thankfully the ashes were cold and Sula seemed certain they were in no imminent danger. The goblins would not strike in the same area twice, she told him. All the same, Velkaan was doubly cautious as they proceeded. When he mentioned that they would soon be arriving in Perrahove she cried out in alarm. It had taken him a little while to discover what she was saying and not until they happened upon a rabbit warren did he realise she was talking of tunnels. It seemed the goblins had one close to Perrahove and a few other places in Ansuk too. This was a very valuable piece of information. </p>\r\n<p>A piece that might very well make all the difference as far as her future treatment was concerned. He turned the horse westward. Better to lose time and give Perrahove a wide berth than walk into the midst of her kinfolk! </p>\r\n<p>And so the incoming tide of preparation did lap gently on the shores of Rohansuk</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nBut out upon the open seas of Fate,\r\n<br>The hurricane called Death did whip the depths and stir the turbulent waters of War.\r\n<br>The hand of Evil plucked at the skirt of the Earth,\r\n<br>Pulling the threads of those he commanded and watched...\r\n<br>Watched the foaming waves come rolling across the waters &mdash;\r\n<br>Wild and unstoppable &mdash;\r\n<br>Soon they would rise in tidal fury.\r\n<br>Cresting, blood red upon the shores of the sandy beaches of ignorance,\r\n<br>Smashing in relentless fury over innocent and guilty alike,\r\n<br>Swallowing, Engulfing, Destroying\r\n<br>The wise rally to the Dragon’s call,\r\n<br>Joining forces to warn and prepare\r\n<br>To hold at bay the circling winds and bide the calm of the encroaching storm,\r\n<br>To still the twisting maw of the hurricane’s eye,\r\n<br>To wait and watch...&nbsp;for promises fulfilled and Elfin feet to march,\r\n<br>For Races called... and hearing...

The mood was tinged with sadness as Alyse and Cymon told them of Jarok’s death. Alyse felt a pang of remorse at the pain in Mailon’s face as he heard of the loss of the grandson he thought he had but never knew. She felt the touch of Cymon’s mind as her pity made her waver in their decision to keep Jarok’s true parentage a secret.<p></p>\r\n<p>''It''s safer this way,'' he reminded her in the silent communication they alone shared. ''Remember... while they believe in you, their hope stays alive.'' </p>\r\n<p>She blinked slowly to acknowledge the sense of his advice and encouragement.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry, grandfather," she leaned across the table that separated them and squeezed Mailon’s hand comfortingly. Mailon patted hers'' in return then rose and, eyes glistening with unshed tears, rounded on Cymon with scathing accusation.</p>\r\n<p>"And where were you? To leave my grandchildren alone with an untrained gipsy?"</p>\r\n<p>Cymon bolted to his feet, his eyes furious and his tongue hot with anger.</p>\r\n<p>"Firstly, that untrained gipsy gave his life in an attempt to save Jarok and I resent and abhor your superior sneer that demeans both his action and his unselfish sacrifice. He was a good man and worth any Elf I know."</p>\r\n<p>There gasps of disbelief at Cymon’s scornful tones but he was not about to stop now.</p>\r\n<p>"Secondly, I didn''t know they were your grandchildren... not that that makes them any more precious than any other children... because that was just one in a long list of things you decided to keep quiet about. Thirdly, don''t you dare try and make it sound like you cared about him more than me... you didn''t even know him! I loved him like a brother... no, like a son." </p>\r\n<p>Mailon’s face went deathly white at this point and Alyse sent a warning thrust into Cymon’s mind but he was too angry to care by now.</p>\r\n<p>"Fourthly," he continued, "I was doing what we... I... thought was right, getting supplies and hopefully information. And finally, if we''re getting down to laying blame... where were you?</p>\r\n<p>Why didn''t you send for them as soon as Kielton died? </p>\r\n<p>Why didn''t you send a larger force that could have protected them properly? </p>\r\n<p>And why, for reasons known only to yourself, when you did decide to send only me... did you send me so ill equipped? </p>\r\n<p>You must have known the spindle darts were useless against the Citog and how powerful Duman is. You know, I was of a mind to come in here and denounce you ''traitor''. If it wasn''t for Alyse’s assurances, I still might!"</p>\r\n<p>By the time he had finished the chamber was in an uproar. Some of the Elders were on their feet demanding he be banished from the chamber until he learnt more respect. Others were demanding he be banished from Phelise altogether. And one of the older members had even fainted in shock! It came as something of an anti-climax then, when Mailon merely smiled and called them to be quiet. Now their discontent was aimed at Mailon himself.</p>\r\n<p>"SILENCE,” his cry resounded around the chamber in reply. "You sound like a houseful of babbling children."</p>\r\n<p>Again, gasps of shock echoed around the chamber but quieter this time and one by one, the Elders did as they were bid and sat silently back in their seats. </p>\r\n<p>"Congratulations, Cymon. I see the boy has given way to the man at last. It''s about time, is it not?" Mailon’s voice held none of the anger Cymon was expecting. Instead there was a tone of respect he had never heard before and it filled him with shame for his behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sor... " He started to apologise but Mailon cut him short.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t disappoint me now. Never apologise for telling the truth. You were right about the gipsy, Tielan, and it is I who owe the apology, both to him and to you, which I hope you will accept. As to my grandchildren... it was their fathers'' wish that they remain in the outside world, since they were more human than Elfin and he felt it would be easier for them in the long run." He paused for a moment to stare the renewed murmurings of the other Elders into silence.</p>\r\n<p>"I can see that, in a number of ways, we were perhaps unfair in our dealings with you. But in this our hands were tied. We had received an anonymous message about Alyse. It told us of what had been done to her and warned us not to do or say anything that might alarm her or cause the Power to become active, but at the same time get her to Phelise, out of Duman’s reach. We couldn''t send a larger force: Because of this and because it would have alerted Duman, who would have sent an equally large one against her. Our only hope lay in subterfuge and persuasion. In short... you! </p>\r\n<p>Ah! I see that surprises you. Let me explain. I went to the commander of every Qînsar in the hope of finding a suitable candidate. I was beginning to despair when I happened to spy you exercising in the courtyard and saw how strong your cloaking ability is. I know you will protest your closeness to being A''mathan but nevertheless it is your lineage."</p>\r\n<p>“Why does everyone keep bringing that up lately?” he wondered irritably. </p>\r\n<p>“Perhaps because the Mother is trying to tell you something.” </p>\r\n<p>“Not now Alyse,” he returned sharply and centred his attention back on Mailon. </p>\r\n<p>"Are you impressed? Tell me of another Elf, if you can, that is able to sustain an illusion as long as you can &mdash; or one that can extend it over others too. None that I know of... and don''t try to deny it for your teachers had already confirmed it. Plus, that horse of yours, I was told, is worth two Elite, so I knew you would have adequate support. That was when I knew you were the one and if you had only followed orders... " He paused to allow Cymon to squirm uncomfortably for a moment or two, "... Duman would not have known where you were and you should have been able to return before Duman even knew you were there. But I''m jumping ahead of myself. Your teachers also told me you had been offered and had accepted a position in the Sûnæri Select upon your ''fledging''. A position you would have had to forfeit to accept the mission since, as you know, the Select are the Guardians of Phelise and are oath sworn never to set foot in the outside world. I spoke to your mother and when she told me of your way with the Elfin... " He stopped as Cymon suddenly pressed his hand against his temple as though in pain.</p>\r\n<p>''Now there is something you failed to mention!'' Alyse’s words stabbed into his mind with another painful jab. Cymon winced again and closed his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you alright?" Asked Mailon walking around the table and placing a hand on his shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes... thank you. A sudden headache is all. I''m sorry to interrupt you," replied Cymon forcing himself to ignore Alyse’s attentions.</p>\r\n<p>''Later!'' she promised and left him in peace.</p>\r\n<p>"If you''re sure," Mailon was saying. "We could always adjourn till later? No? Well then, where was I? Oh, yes! When Naemon told me of your way with the Elfin, we came up with a plan that would ensure you would volunteer." </p>\r\n<p>"Raenara?" he turned to look at his mother who laughed at his incredulity.</p>\r\n<p>"I knew you would do anything to get out of marrying her."</p>\r\n<p>"But that was hardly fair on her... "</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, Raenara is fine. She''s now happily betrothed to Wynaise. She says hello, by the way, and hopes you''re not too disappointed."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon tried to control the twitching of his errant lips. Alyse tried to help with painful jabs to his mind. He took refuge in annoyance.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t believe you all conspired against me. Why didn''t you just come straight out and ask me to go? I only accepted the Sûnæri because I didn''t think there was any chance of me ever leaving Phelise anyway."</p>\r\n<p>"Because your position as a Fledgling gave us the perfect opportunity to make it appear a minor and simple routine mission about which we need reveal only the barest detail. The less you knew, the less you could inadvertently slip." </p>\r\n<p>"With all due respect, there''s barest and then there''s nothing. It was the very fact that it is was all so ''minor'' that started me questioning in the first place."</p>\r\n<p>"I know. We got it wrong and I''m sorry."</p>\r\n<p>"Now there''s something you don''t hear told very often,” quipped a mischievous voice that shook the whole chamber into stunned silence and caused the poor Elder who had fainted earlier, and only just roused to hear Mailon’s final sentence, to promptly keel over again. "An elder admitting he was wrong!"</p>\r\n<p>The culprit was Royle, who all this time had been lazing across the tabletop and who was now gone. In his place lounged a tiny, jug-eared elf with a tattoo, high on his left cheek. He swung his legs around to dangle over the edge of the table and grinned at Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok,” she cried, before her voice warmed into the deep, rich tones of Ecos. "I didst wonder when thou wouldst reveal thyself. ''Tis good to see thee again after so long."</p>\r\n<p>"My Lady," Yushok jumped nimbly to the floor and bowed to Alyse. "Ecos. Time has been good to you, I see. You have grown most fair."</p>\r\n<p>"And thou hast changed not one iota. If thou wert not so dear, thou wouldst forever remain a cat,” threatened the voice of Ecos with jovial insincerity.</p>\r\n<p>"Now I am wounded," retorted Yushok placing his hands over his heart. Only when his audience failed to react did he realise that they were still staring at him in open-mouthed amazement... those that had managed to stay conscious, that is! </p>\r\n<p>"What in the Mother’s name is wrong with everybody? Wake up! Wake up,” he clapped his hands loudly. Cymon, having been through so much already, was the first to recover. He stood and held out his hands in formal greeting.</p>\r\n<p>"I am Cymon. Firstborn... "</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, yes. I know all that. I''m Yushok. It''s good to see you face to face too... in a manner of speaking," he concluded wryly, since he barely came up to Cymon’s chest. "You had me worried for a while there, in the Mornay. Ah, Mailon. Let me congratulate you on your choice. He worked out rather well... with a little help."</p>\r\n<p>"I am honoured to meet the great Yushok of legend and overjoyed to learn our cousins, the A''mathan are still with us." Mailon’s voice rose and fell with an uncharacteristic lack of confidence. The bright eyes of the A''mathan dimmed for a moment, then flared again with mischievous intent as he whispered loudly from behind his hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Is there somewhere else we can go? All these statues are making me very uncomfortable."</p>\r\n<p>"We can retire to my house," offered Naemon getting to her feet. "Jerle will be ready for dinner by now. We would be pleased if you would join us?"</p>\r\n<p>"How could I refuse such a gracious offer from a direct descendant? You seem surprised. Surely my name is transcribed in your lineage? Dear, dear, this is most remiss. Let me see. My fathers'' name was Yubey, my mother Tai''shuk. My sister was called... " His words faded away as he and Naemon walked out arm in arm. </p>\r\n<p>"Did you know about this?" Cymon looked accusingly at Alyse. "That I am descended from Yushok himself?"</p>\r\n<p>"Would you have listened to me had I told you? When I tried to tell you...?" she reminded him of their conversation in the wheelhouse during their flight.</p>\r\n<p>"No," he admitted with a wry grimace. "I can''t believe I had him dangling by the scruff of his neck,” he suddenly exclaimed in dismay.</p>\r\n<p>"Now this sounds interesting," said Mailon, prompting for more as he ushered them both out of the chamber.</p>\r\n<p>After talking till dawn, Alyse and Cymon saw little of Yushok over the next few days. A stream of gifts kept him busy and invitations, brought by an assortment of nervously excited granddaughters, daughters, sisters and nieces, as the Elders vied with one another for his favour. Though this meant her own plans were interrupted, Alyse could not bring herself to begrudge them this indulgence after centuries of believing their cousins lost forever, since there was little prospect for many joyful times in the foreseeable future. But, after four days of waiting for the Elders to re-convene her anxieties about fulfilling her promises carried her to the home of Mailon, to request his intervention. The next morning the Council of Elders convened, agreeing to see Alyse at midday.</p>\r\n<p>They arrived early. Sitting on the sweet smelling grass, in the welcome shade of the great oak whose massive root system formed the Oaken Chamber, Alyse reached nervously for Cymon’s hand as they waited for the doors to open.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll do fine, don''t worry so," he reassured her. "Just remember this is a formal audience granted at your request and to begin with the Rite of Greeting. Even though they already know who you are, all such audiences are preceded in this manner. After that, just be yourself."</p>\r\n<p>"Why do I not just allow Ecos to do this?" she asked herself as much as Cymon, though it was Cymon who answered.</p>\r\n<p>"Because you want to remain yourself, not simply an extension of what is within."</p>\r\n<p>"I did say that but... "</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, good. I''m not too late," cried Yushok breathlessly running to sit beside them. </p>\r\n<p>"Go away. And stop that right now!" Alyse snapped sternly as he lifted his left foot to scratch behind his ear.</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry. After centuries of being feline some habits are hard to break," Yushok apologised, pulling his leg down by the knee and tucking it beneath him.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse glowered at him with disbelief and barely contained anger.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s the truth... now and then! Though I admit it may have seemed contrived to some. That was purely an unintentional insult," insisted Yushok. It might have been more believable were it not for the twinkle in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Have I missed something?" asked Cymon, intrigued. He had never seen Alyse so sincerely angry with Yushok... in any form.</p>\r\n<p>"Apparently," she began through clenched teeth, "yesterday, while Yushok was having dinner with Gyrrion and his niece, he dropped his head in his soup and began lapping noisily."</p>\r\n<p>"A lapse in manners perhaps but hardly an insult," observed Cymon. "And, as he has explained, understandable given his recent lifestyle," Cymon defended the A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>"He then proceeded,” she continued, raking the A''mathan with eyes of scathing rebuke, "to give himself a thorough wash. Poor Gyrrion almost choked and his niece is still in a state of shock and unable to rise from her bed."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh! You never? You did,” laughed Cymon loudly... much to Alyse’s disapproval. "I wish I''d been there. Gyrrion is such a snob."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re not joking. D''you know he spent all afternoon regaling me... me... A''mathan... with the superiority of his lineage and telling me how privileged I was to be marrying his niece. She''s a nice enough child, as Elfin go, but marriage?"</p>\r\n<p>"So you admit it was a deliberate act?" Alyse pounced on him.</p>\r\n<p>"I admit nothing but a slip of the tongue... if you will excuse the pun," quipped Yushok shamelessly. Cymon received a double dose of pain... a mental stab in the head for siding with, and encouraging, the A''mathan and an angry squeezing of the hand she still held for his loud guffaw. But any the opening of the doors and the guards’ spared him more bid for them to enter, which they did side by side with Yushok tagging along behind. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon nodded at the Elders, then left Alyse in the centre of the room and slipped into one of the chairs that lined the walls. Completely ignoring Gyrrion’s anger, the soft round of whispered titters and the air of silent amusement assumed by the remaining Elders, Yushok skipped lightly onto the table and perched cross-legged in front of Mailon.</p>\r\n<p>"If you would be so kind?" Mailon motioned for the A''mathan to move across slightly, which he did with a wink, an exaggerated sigh and an eyebrow raised in Gyrrion’s direction that had Mailon suddenly suffering from such a fit of coughing that he had to sip at his water before motioning Alyse to begin.</p>\r\n<p>"Revered Elders," she extended her open palms. "I am Alyse-Allienne, firstborn of Sh''ailon and Kielton. Elfin of Halfblood by the lineage of Arysienne, sister of Jarok, Warrior of the Dragon and Betrothed of Cymon."</p>\r\n<p>"Betrothed?" Mailon mouthed to Naemon. The Elfin shrugged, it was news to her too. He made a mental note to have words with Cymon later. </p>\r\n<p>"You already know my story, so I shall not repeat myself but get straight to the point. I have come here to request a boon of you concerning a promise I made to Sir Davin, that the Elfin would ride forth to fight beside them. I ask you now to honour that promise."</p>\r\n<p>"What nonsense is this?"</p>\r\n<p>"What are you doing making promises in our name?"</p>\r\n<p>"Outrageous!"</p>\r\n<p>"Wasting our time!"</p>\r\n<p>The room was abuzz with like-minded outcry, until Mailon stopped them by banging his fist on the table.</p>\r\n<p>"We have granted the Elfin audience. We will hear her arguments," he said, loud and firm.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, she needn''t expect favour just because she is your grand-daughter!"</p>\r\n<p>"I wouldn''t want it so, Gyrrion... and neither would she." Mailon turned to Alyse. "Continue."</p>\r\n<p>"The Elfin know better than any the threat Duman poses. Man cannot stand alone. For this reason, Sir Davin and Sir Tynan, have undertaken to convince the other races to unite. This will not be an easy task. The races have kept their separate ways for many years. In order to help sway their decisions, I made Davin the promise to give to them. This I did in the belief, that the Elfin were a honourable and just race. That as one of their own was the cause of Man, and the world’s, need, they would willingly offer aid and strength to the younger and weaker, that they would welcome the opportunity to redress the balance and restore peace of mind to the world. Was I wrong?"</p>\r\n<p>"Are you implying that all this is our fault?" Asked one of the Elders in a tone of offended incredulity.</p>\r\n<p>"Indirectly perhaps. Duman is Elfin, after all," she replied.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t be held accountable for every elf’s'' actions and decisions. Duman chose his own way, we didn''t force it upon him," decried another.</p>\r\n<p>"Not directly, I agree. But when teachings and strictures force a child to suppress what might have been a harmless dream, had he been able to talk about it openly with someone, until it was twisted into a secret, bitter desire that was at the forefront of his eventual corruption... then I would say that those responsible for such laws and teachings must inevitably accept a portion of the responsibility."</p>\r\n<p>Mailon smiled. Was this granddaughter of his really only sixteen human years old, he wondered proudly. He nodded encouragement to her as a thoughtful silence fell over the Council before the Elders began to talk amongst themselves. There was a deal of head shaking, shrugging and arm waving. Voices were raised and lowered again. Shoulders sagged in acceptance of the truth in her words whilst others crossed their arms upon the table in tight-lipped, stubborn denial. Finally, one of the youngest of them, Jarshÿn by name, rose to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"The Elfin has a point and we all know it in our hearts, even if we are too proud or stubborn to admit it. I''ve said for centuries that many of our laws are too binding and there''s too much commanding and too little discussing. We have bred this monster, whether we like it or not. We have watched him, waiting for him to make his move. For what... if not this moment... this chance to redeem the Elfin name. I say we honour the promise made in our name and send out the Elite. Do we confirm?"</p>\r\n<p>There was a majority assent, the opposition coming from a small hard-core group who turned their chairs in refusal and it was from these that Gyrrion jumped angrily to his feet, his chin held high so that he stared down the length of his nose at Alyse, in all appearance young and defenceless, in an effort to make her feel even more so.</p>\r\n<p>"How dare you,” he spluttered, pointing his finger at her. "First you tell us that you have had the audacity to speak for this Council with the outsiders and then you compound your crime by this ludicrous and unforgivably insulting accusation. Who d''you think you are? And what in the Mother’s name has possessed you," he rounded on his fellow Elders, eyes bulging in his purple face, "to give credence to such utter drivel by even contemplating granting this outrageous request to send forth the Elite. Are we so low that we are to be ordered about by some female half-breed?"</p>\r\n<p>Almost instantly Alyse’s head snapped back. She trembled and the mixed emotions chasing each other across her face gave evidence to her inner struggle. It happened so quickly that only Yushok noticed, since he alone had been watching her closely (and with amused anticipation) during Gyrrions'' outburst.</p>\r\n<p>"Now you''ve done it,” he whispered, sliding along the table and grinning at Gyrrion as every eye turned upon the Elder in stunned silence. Even those who agreed with him stared at him in amazed disapproval. Others shook their heads sadly, while Mailon glared through narrowed eyes of disgust. Only his position as head of the Council, that called him to set an example of acceptable behaviour, kept his lips closed over a tongue burning with scathing contempt. Cymon had no such restraints and his chair skidded across the room as he leapt to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Elder or not, you will retract your words and apologise, or answer to me... her betrothed." he demanded. </p>\r\n<p>Mailon’s eyes were not the only ones to widen at the audacity of a ''fledgling'', betrothed or not, to call satisfaction upon an Elder. But their amazement of this was as nothing to what happened next.</p>\r\n<p>"Sit down and be quiet, you insolent whipper-snapper, before I have you thrown out,” ordered Gyrrion, unwittingly compounding his crime.</p>\r\n<p>"Now you''ve really done it,” said a delighted Yushok, counting down under his breath as</p>\r\n<p>Alyse turned her head to smile at Cymon and wave him back into his seat. "One, two, three, four..." </p>\r\n<p>"Do not trouble yourself, Ph''nyå Y''sièn... beloved of my heart... "</p>\r\n<p>"Five, six, seven," Yushok counted. </p>\r\n<p>"For I despise his apology and desire none of it," Alyse told Cymon with quiet calmness. Inner lids slid open.</p>\r\n<p>"Eight-nine-ten..." Yushok raced the remaining numbers off quickly, "...and here we go,” he held out his hands towards Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>The great oak heralded her transformation with a resounding, hollow boom as the Power flared in her and seemed to grow until she filled the room. Golden skin glittered in the light from the lanterns, tinting her energy-charged hair that crackled and sparked about her head and shoulders. Above their heads the boughs creaked, rustling their heavy-laden branches in joyous recognition even as the room was filled with a loud groaning and the sound of twisting wood. Overhead a new root was sprouting, growing rapidly and in the blink of an eye, impaled the chair that Gyrrion should have been sitting in. White and shaking, Gyrrion fell to his knees. </p>\r\n<p>The deep, resonant voice that thundered into the room was cold and hard, as was the face of Alyse wherein the burning, amber eyes of Ecos, crimson-veined with anger, scoured the now cringing Gyrrion.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou seemest less sure of thyself, loud one," the querying voice mocked the blubbering Elder while the weight of the Dragon’s anger pressed down on him until he could scarcely breathe. "Wast not but moments ago thou wert filled with contempt for this female half-breed? ''Tis meet that thou art on thine knees, for in truth thou art not fit to stand before her. Female this body undoubtedly is. Halfblood also... of Elfin and Man... is fact. But so too, is she Ecos. Firstborn of the Draconian! </p>\r\n<p>Joined and One with the Earth is she. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse-Allienne and... Powerwielder... is her name. </p>\r\n<p>This is her bloodline and ''tis second to none, save Y''siel herself &mdash; yet thou direst to attempt to belittle her with thine supercilious insults. Verily, ''tis no surprise that Duman didst spring from thy lineage, for thou sharest a great prideful disdain and love of self. Thou art not fit to sit upon this Council and henceforth thou shalt no more. Remove thy presence from this Chamber for thou art no longer welcome here." </p>\r\n<p>As she finished the boughs above shook ominously until Gyrrion managed to drag himself from the room. When the door closed behind him she turned back to the remaining Elders. Those who had sided with Gyrrion shrank down into their seats desperately trying to avoid her gaze, sweating with fear that it was now their turn. But aside from sliding a warning glance over their positions she ignored them. She closed her eyes, drawing the Power back into herself. Her presence diminished, her hair fell down her back, her skin paled to creamy white and when her lids lifted, cornflower-blue directed Alyse’s quiet but firm address to Jarshÿn and Mailon.</p>\r\n<p>"Revered Elders. Will you honour our promise? We would also request then," she continued when the entire Council nodded quickly, "that as well as the main force, which needs to be sent as soon as possible to Symtar, that you will also send a qînsar to Port Canest, there to meet with Sir Davin and Sir Tynan and accompany them to speak with the Fellis and the Soyex. Plus another to Willoway, in Lower Westbrooke, to aid those whom I fear may be in need there. The latter two immediately."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s already done," answered Mailon, waving to one of the guards at the door as the</p>\r\n<p>Council nodded their assent, "but in return I would request a boon of you. Gyrrion... " The name of the shamed Elder was laced with pity as Mailon’s gaze drifted over her shoulder to the closed doors. Alyse sighed deeply. Her own eyes a confused mixture of unrepentant determination and remorse.</p>\r\n<p>"Why? Are you not also angry? As my grandfather is it not also you whom he insulted?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course I''m angry and grieved by his outburst, for myself and my daughter as well as for you. But I have known Gyrrion far longer than you have. He can be irritating and foolish and can cast insult without really trying... very often without even being aware of it! He is overly proud and aggravatingly irascible. He''s also old and set in his ways and as a result almost unbendingly stubborn. But for all his faults, he is wise in many things and plays the voice of caution when others of us would speak with our hearts. We understand his foibles and have used them often to the advantage of Phelise. This time, we admit, he has perhaps gone too far but we are willing to forgive if you are; for in truth, to lose him would not benefit this Council or Phelise."</p>\r\n<p>"Mayhap you are right and we have acted hastily."</p>\r\n<p>"And not without a short measure of lineage pride to boot,” observed Yushok in a loud whisper. "Correct me if I''m wrong," he challenged as her eyes narrowed upon him. "Then I rest my case," he murmured softly into her silence, winked impudently and leaned back on one elbow while she turned back to Mailon before she gave in to the urge to stamp her foot in temper. </p>\r\n<p>"It may well be that his overly superior manner is but a defence against the stain of shame his line bears," she mused aloud. "Are you all of the same mind in this?" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>"We are," Mailon answered for the room of nodding heads.</p>\r\n<p>"Then Gyrrion may return... after a suitable period of reflection. His chair however, shall remain as such for all time. He may assume a seat at the end of the table. Let both be a reminder to him and others of the error of his ways and of his fate, should he be tempted to return to his old ways. ."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," said Mailon rising to his feet with a smile. "And now that the formalities are over, let''s discuss the finer details."</p>\r\n<p>"We''ll leave that with you Mailon, if you don''t mind. You can inform us of them on the morrow. The rest of us would like to talk with Gyrrion while these events are still fresh in his mind. Yushok... Cymon... Powerwielder." Jarshÿn bowed his head and led the Council away.</p>\r\n<p>They were just agreeing it would be as easy to talk in the comfort of Naemon’s house than in the chamber when Alyse suddenly swayed on her feet, one hand clutching her breast, the other grabbing Cymon’s arm for support. All colour drained from her face, even the exposed, amber orbs of the Dragon were paled to a faint yellow in her distress.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s wrong child?" asked Mailon as tears ran down her cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse turned to Cymon to answer.</p>\r\n<p>"Sir Alnac. He is dead," she sobbed. </p>\r\n<p>"How do you know?"</p>\r\n<p>Alyse pulled aside the collar of her dress and there in the hollow of her throat was a tiny Dragonmark, not much bigger than his thumbnail. </p>\r\n<p>"Oh, Cymon,” she cried, "I never thought it would begin so soon," and burst into another fit of weeping.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon swept her up in his arms and carried her back to Naemon’s house. By the time they arrived she had managed to regain most of her composure and though they all insisted she go straight to bed she would have none of it, settling instead on the couch.</p>\r\n<p>"There is too much to be done in too little a time," she argued, fingering the mark at her throat and none could fault her reasoning.</p>\r\n<p>The next morning she and Cymon resumed their search of the Archives, to try and find a map that would help them locate the beginning of their directions from Eona. Yushok joined them at mid-day, hopping onto the edge of the table and twisting around the map they were currently working from. He pushed it away disinterestedly.</p>\r\n<p>"S''yumêrra? Duman would never put it there," he said positively, popping a roasted mushroom into his mouth from the basket he had brought along, courtesy of Naemon.</p>\r\n<p>"Why not?" asked Cymon, who had been quite hopeful about the glacial ranges to the north of the Soyex homeland.</p>\r\n<p>"Because it would be too obvious," he tapped the map. "Jhai Nahv; Glacier; Crystal Tomb. And the Soyex being as they are, they would never have rested until they found it. They aren''t short of a few Seers themselves. Xaushoi, I believe they call them. By the way, Gyrrion is feeling better today and sends his apologies. He''s not such a bad fellow now that his boorish shell has been cracked. It was quite a pleasant morning."</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry?" said Cymon, only half listening as he glanced up from the new map he had unrolled. </p>\r\n<p>"Gyrrion. I went to... "</p>\r\n<p>Cymon’s eyes were already glued back to the parchment.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, never mind! So, how''s it coming?" he asked, leaning across the map and twisting to look up into Cymon’s face.</p>\r\n<p>"We have a dozen possibilities... seven, now you''ve vetoed S''yumêrra," he replied irritably, pushing the A''mathan along the table. "And absolutely no ideas." </p>\r\n<p>"That good? I thought you might have done better by now."</p>\r\n<p>"The vision was very vague," said Cymon defensively.</p>\r\n<p>"We are open to suggestions," snapped Alyse still smarting from the A''mathans'' remarks in the Oaken Chamber.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell me the vision and I''ll see what I can do. Aren''t either of you going to have any of this?" asked Yushok, laying a slice of tomato on a wedge of cheese before taking a large bite.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course! You weren''t there, were you?" said Cymon. "Eona said there was a river of white water that barred our path. A woman rose from the river. Dressed in blue ice with a crown upon her head. A silver circlet."</p>\r\n<p>"Hmm! I can see where you might think it was Jhai Nahv. Blue ice would suggest a glacier." He took another bite of his cheese. "What about this crown? That seems the obvious clue. Did she give any description?"</p>\r\n<p>"She said it was plain at the back and peaked in front. It had a bear engraved on it and was studded with precious stones."</p>\r\n<p>"That sounds familiar. Describe it again," he told Cymon, stuffing the last piece of cheese in his mouth and chewing with slow deliberation and a thoughtful frown. Cymon dutifully repeated the description. Yushok swallowed. "I know the one. I''ve seen it,” he grinned. "In Iåñya M''ath."</p>\r\n<p>"The Tomb cannot possibly be in the Mornay," answered Alyse. "There are no rivers there!"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not saying that it is," Yushok mumbled through the mouthful of buttered roll he had just bitten off. "Just that that is where I saw the crown."</p>\r\n<p>"There must be something about the crown that is important," Cymon cut in. "Who’s'' was it? Where did it come from?"</p>\r\n<p>"Hush and let me think," said Yushok, licking the butter off his fingers and getting down to pace the floor. Alyse and Cymon waited with growing impatience. Cymon opened his mouth... and closed it again.</p>\r\n<p>''Best say nothing. He will deliberately keep us waiting longer if you disturb him now,''</p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s silent advice echoed in his mind. Cymon filled his mouth with a fruit biscuit to keep it occupied, for he could not otherwise trust himself to silence.</p>\r\n<p>"Now what?" he groaned impatiently when, without a word, Yushok suddenly ran off down the long shelves of scrolls. He came back looking extremely pleased with himself and laid the ancient, cracked parchment he was carrying gently on the table. He gazed slowly from one to the other; deliberately keeping them waiting though his whole face was aglow with excitement. Alyse tapped her foot. </p>\r\n<p>"Oh, very well... The crown was a gift to the A''mathan from the Dwarven king. It was forged for their first king by a silversmith, who travelled every land in order to find the gems and metals of which it was made. The Dwarfs'' name was Tacha. And this is the place you''re looking for," he rolled open the map. On it was drawn a land long before Rohansuk. Places and names were few and of those, Cymon recognised only one. Iåñya M''ath. A huge grin spread over Yushok’s face and he held a dramatic pause before placing his finger slowly upon the mountain range marked as Tachamund.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m surprised you didn''t remember any of this Ecos?" he cast a puzzled glance at Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos'' memories, like his Power were divided. Those pertaining to the crown must still be encased in the other ''Eye''. Alyse defended the Dragon. </p>\r\n<p>Yushok winked at Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"Silly me. Here I was thinking you''d just forgotten!"</p>\r\n<p>This time Alyse did stamp her foot. Then she snatched up a roll and stormed out of the Archives. Cymon held back his laughter until she was gone, but it did him no good.</p>\r\n<p>''I heard that,'' she warned. </p>\r\n<p>"Thanks a lot," he moaned at Yushok, rolling his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Just think of all the making up you get to do," quipped the A''mathan, nudging him smartly and flicking his eyebrow up and down.</p>\r\n<p>"So, this Tachamund?" Cymon tapped the map, changing the subject.</p>\r\n<p>"Tacha’s Forge," Yushok translated. "What Man calls... Borinian Heights!"</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 23, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

(35, 'Eona dares all', 'CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="M" src="M.gif">ailon sent not two, but three qînsar of twenty Elite from Phelise. The first went to wait for Davin and Tynan at Port Canest. They split into four groups and, disguised as merchantmen, took rooms at various inns around the port. Each day they made their way down to the docks, looking over the incoming cargo, purchasing a few things here and there for appearances sake, and to watch for the knights'' ship.<p></p>\r\n<p>A second qînsar, at Cymon’s request had journeyed to the village of Parlen... the innkeeper who had given aid to Cymon and his company during their flight. They would repay the debt he owed him for the wagon and pair and also help him to gather all the people he could and take them to the safety of the barrack township of Amrose. </p>\r\n<p>The third went to Willoway. Their orders being that, if Ador had been unable, they were to remove Eiva and her friends by fair words or force and take them to Ador’s plateau. For the former groups all went according to plan. For the latter however, things were not so straightforward. They had arrived to find the village razed to the ground, save for Sylo’s cottage across the bridge and Eiva’s, which was completed engulfed in a tangled web of thick green ivy and under siege. </p>\r\n<p>It had all started a few days after Ador had visited to keep his promise to Alyse. Despite his affirmation to Alyse that he would take Eiva to the plateau he had been forced to leave empty handed. Nothing short of picking her up and carrying her would shift her, an act that the two dogs objected to by biting his ankles and refusing to let him out of the door. Like his father and Alyse before him, he had eventually conceded defeat. After Ador had left, Sylo had taken to swaggering about on the bridge even more than usual, staring down towards her cottage with intense hatred. Eiva had ignored it. The man was nothing but a bully and she felt safe enough with her dogs to protect her. Then one evening the first of the strangers arrived and next morning Eiva noticed the first signs of re-growth from the root Alyse had given her. </p>\r\n<p>Straightaway she had visited all those in the village she knew to be good people.</p>\r\n<p>Predictably, they smiled patiently as they promised to pop over tomorrow or the next day, all the while secretly thinking that the poor old dear had finally lost her marbles. Each time she returned home alone and began to get a taste of the frustration suffered by Ador and Alyse over her own stubbornness.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, you did your best dear," Petra would tell her every time she got back and hand her a cup of camomile tea. "They''ll come when they''re ready."</p>\r\n<p>"That might be too late," Eiva would whisper quietly to herself and stare worriedly out of the window at the growing group on the bridge. They were a mixed bunch. Some were rough and unkempt. Some were plain and ordinary looking, not much different to the villagers themselves. Some were well dressed and heavily bejewelled. But they all had one thing in common; blank, colourless faces and black, expressionless eyes that stared, fixed and unblinking. Every time she looked there were more and Sylo was at their head. His knowing, sneering glances began to frighten her at last. </p>\r\n<p>The light faded earlier that last day and there was a smell of rain in the air. A cold wind came up, whipping at the shutters as it whistled its way through the village. There was a definite storm brewing. A dark cloud settled overhead with a heavy sense of impending doom. The restless villagers began pacing their floors and as the intimidating group on the bridge expanded in number, they began to discuss Eiva’s wild tale. With strained nerves and heads throbbing from the rising tension, it came to sound more and more plausible. They gathered all they could carry and came knocking at Eiva’s door. The clinging plants were already beginning to stretch towards the window ledge. The last to arrive only just made it in time and had to be helped over the thick stems criss-crossing halfway up the doorway. Eiva had done a quick headcount.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s everybody," she had announced and slid the bolts on the door. Her words had seemed to fall upon the growing plant like some kind of verbal fertilizer, for the kettle barely had time to boil than it had completely covered the cottage, plunging it into darkness.</p>\r\n<p>"Right then, let''s see about some supper!" Eiva’s busy voice had broken through the tense silence as the light from the lantern broke through the darkness.</p>\r\n<p>Ever since then the cottage had been under the almost constant attack, now being witnessed by the qînsar, of the insane mob led by Sylo. Their grey, gaunt features, blank eyes, stiff, jerky movements (like string puppets at a fair) and the hollow, empty wail they emitted, lifted the hairs on the necks and sent shivers down the spines of the watching Elite. </p>\r\n<p>The elves slipped quietly back down the riverbank. There were at least a hundred surrounding the house and guarding the bridge, far too many for a frontal assault. The Ph''nyr, the Captain of the qînsar, decided on cut and run tactics &mdash; a series of quick attacks to pick off as many as they could and lower the odds. They moved along the rivers'' edge to the bridge, half slipping underneath so they would come at the enemy from two fronts. Arrows flying, they attacked, none missed, many finding fatal targets yet having no effect whatsoever as the victims merely snapped off the offending shafts, seemingly oblivious to the bleeding wounds. These people were already dead... they just did not know it! </p>\r\n<p>The Elite fell back. </p>\r\n<p>Laying flat along the top of the bank they watched the scene below. The mob appeared to have totally forgotten about the Elite already and had returned about their intent. The only effect the Elfin attack appeared to have had, was to increase the enemy’s'' frustration. Their furious attempts to destroy the living shield protecting the house intensified. Some tried to dig the plants up but the deeper they dug, the further the roots stretched down into the earth. This was abandoned in an attempt to burn it. Lamp-oil was poured around the base of the plants but the earth soaked it up as quickly as they could pour it and the fresh, moist leaves resisted all flame put to them. They chopped and hacked but for each stem they managed to cut away two more sprouted, growing vigorously so that it was thicker than when they had started. Like rabid dogs they foamed at the mouths in their madness and tore viciously at the greenery, their fury rising with each ineffectual moment. The Elite too, were filled with a rising frustration. Again and again they attacked but to no avail. The enemy refused to fall or be drawn away from their task.</p>\r\n<p>It was stalemate on all fronts! </p>\r\n<p>The Elite gathered by the rivers'' edge to plan one last assault. After much discussion they decided the only thing to do was to fire their remaining arrows and try to burn the creatures. They felt like cowards and murderers. To kill in battle was one thing but this went against all their moral codes. Yet there seemed no other way to rescue those trapped inside the cottage. </p>\r\n<p>They were gathering the means to set a small fire when the first rat appeared, poking its head from a hole close to the waters edge and blinking, unafraid, at the elf closest to it. Another appeared elsewhere, then another. More and more until each elf was surrounded by a circle of twitching whiskers and tails and gazing questioningly at their Ph''nyr, who held up his hand for stillness. It was a most bizarre situation. A single swing of a blade would easily have sent those that survived scuttling back down their holes but for some reason the Ph''nyr was inclined to let events run their course, sensing something important was about to happen. </p>\r\n<p>Slowly, he lowered himself into a squatting position. As he did a smaller animal, this one brown in colour with a much shorter tail, came squeaking from beneath the earth. It stopped by his foot and sat, just like a small dog, staring up the elf with black, beady eyes that never wavered. It blinked slowly and the Ph''nyr responded by placing the back of his hand flat upon the ground. The rat cocked his head, shifting its eyes for a brief moment from eyes to palm, then holding the elf’s gaze, walked onto the hand and sniffed at the wrist. The elf kept his hand as still as possible, resisting the tickling urge to scratch, until the rat was satisfied and jumped off. It gave a high-pitched squeak and the other rats abandoned their study of the two-legs to join the growing numbers emerging from below.</p>\r\n<p>"What was that all about, Ammoel?" one the elves asked his Ph''nyr.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know but they''re starting to upset the horses," replied Ammoel, flicking his head toward the snorting animals that were shuffling nervously as the rats milled in and out of their legs. "Take them away. I don''t want them stomping on any if I can help it. I''m going to follow these," he waved his arm in the direction of the massing rats, so thick now the grass was invisible beneath them. Carefully he stepped to one side as, with no more room on the riverside they began sweeping forward. Too many to count, more and more filled the space they left behind and swarmed up the high slope, moving with one accord, without pause or hesitation. A single, massive, silent black beast whose definition blurred and constantly changed shape as the rats slipped stealthily over the top and down toward the besieged cottage. The Ph''nyr watched with macabre fascination as the rats surrounded and infiltrated the mob, slipping ignored between the shuffling feet. Then, on an invisible signal... they attacked. </p>\r\n<p>Flapping arms and wailing bodies disappeared beneath a sea of furred death. The high-pitched squealing of the rats brought the other elves running to the scene and they stared with revulsion as skin and flesh was stripped from bone and the ground flowed in a river of blood. Many turned away, retching violently but Ammoel remained steadfast, despite the sickness in his stomach. Horrific as the sight was, it was incredible to see these creatures actually fighting on their behalf. Strange allies but allies nonetheless. He drew his sword.</p>\r\n<p>"Come on,” he shouted and ran along the bank toward the group advancing from the bridge. The others followed. The enemy moved jerkily but they were not slow and the Elite did not have the battle all their own way. Blood flowed on both sides until only one remained, a large man with a huge, swinging belly and a decided waddle to his shuffling gait. He spat and cursed in a language the elves had never heard but knew from books. </p>\r\n<p>Huri! </p>\r\n<p>A strange and eerie silence held the air and they froze as a dark shape manifested and enveloped the body of the man. Eyes empty of everything but intense and bitter hatred. Sylo raised his sword and swaggered forward. One arm gone and his broken neck causing his head to loll at an odd angle, he stepped over the fallen bodies about him. Ammoel raised his own sword and began to arc it down towards Sylo’s neck but his arm was stilled, as Sylo was suddenly lost inside the black beast. The Elite retreated quickly. For some reason the rats wanted this one for themselves and as the elves turned to look upon the scattered remains behind them, they were disinclined to argue. It was over quickly and the multitude of rats were soon gone back over the bank. As the last passed out of sight, Ammoel turned to survey the carnage spread around the cottage. </p>\r\n<p>"Let''s get all this cleared away into the other cottage. I don''t want those inside seeing it."</p>\r\n<p>As soon as the area was cleared, Ammoel approached the cottage. Staring at the impenetrable wall of vine he tried to guess where the position of the door might be. Having picked his spot he walked forward and placed his hands on two of the many stems. Immediately the vine began to grow over him. The rest of his group rushed forward, swords and daggers drawn to cut him free.</p>\r\n<p>"Hold,” he ordered and they stepped back a pace. "Mistress Eiva," he called out in a gentler tone. "Are you there?"</p>\r\n<p>From behind the vine he heard a bolt being slid and the creak of a door swinging open. Then he heard whispering and someone calling for quiet. The same voice answered.</p>\r\n<p>"Who wants to know?"</p>\r\n<p>"Ph''nyr Ammoel, of the Elven Elite. Cymon sent me."</p>\r\n<p>"Then why is the vine still here?" the voice asked suspiciously.</p>\r\n<p>"Allienne said only you could release it."</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know any Allienne... and nobody told me that. I''ll not fall for your tricks so easily Sylo. Get in if you can or go away." The door banged shut.</p>\r\n<p>Ammoel gave himself a mental kick since by now both his legs were held fast by the vine.</p>\r\n<p>"Mistress Eiva, listen. I don''t know any Sylo and I''m sorry for confusing you. Allienne is the Ladys'' Elfin name. You know her as Alyse."</p>\r\n<p>The door creaked open.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s another trick. Just go away and leave us alone!" This time it was a different voice, raised hysterically.</p>\r\n<p>"Petra, do calm yourself dear. Have a cup of tea and let me handle this. You outside. We''re still not coming out. Alyse said to wait in here until she or Cymon came for us. And that''s what we''re going to do,” she finished firmly.</p>\r\n<p>Ammoel blew softly at the sprouting leaf tickling the end of his nose.</p>\r\n<p>"They couldn''t come. They had urgent matters to attend elsewhere. Cymon sent us instead."</p>\r\n<p>"Who''s ''Us''," asked Eiva.</p>\r\n<p>Ammoel blew down his nose again, twitching his nostrils violently to try to get the vine to alter its course.</p>\r\n<p>"Mistress Eiva... if you please. I''m being suffocated out here,” he pleaded.</p>\r\n<p>"Good,” shouted Petra unsympathetically.</p>\r\n<p>"Then you''ll have to do better to convince me," replied Eiva.</p>\r\n<p>"We are Elven Elite. Soldiers, as you say." </p>\r\n<p>"Call yourself what you like, still means nothing to me." </p>\r\n<p>"Wait! Wait,” he cried as he heard the door creaking shut yet again. "I remember something. They gave me a message for you but what sense it makes I cannot think. Redeye."</p>\r\n<p>"It makes perfect sense,” laughed Eiva. "It''s alright everyone. They''re friends."</p>\r\n<p>The vine withered in an instant and Ammoel found himself falling through the open doorway to land in a crumpled heap at her feet. He picked himself up, dusted down his pride along with his trousers and threw it back over his shoulders with a tilt of his chin.</p>\r\n<p>"Mistress Eiva?" asked, Ammoel giving her a half bow as she stepped forward. "Gather everything you can. We are to escort you to the plateau."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not going... "</p>\r\n<p>"By fair words or force, those are my orders. I''m afraid we have no time for fair words, mistress," steel braced the soft tone. "Besides, there''s nothing left to stay for," he added with a sympathetic smile.</p>\r\n<p>Eiva rushed outside and stared in tearful dismay at the ruins of the village, then with typical pragmatism re-entered the cottage and was soon bustling about, giving orders and filling the empty arms of her companions (who were still staring in stunned amazement at the elves). When they could carry no more she announced to Ammoel that they were ready to leave and refusing to look back, left her lifetime home for the final time. After everything they had been through her companions were too dazed and exhausted to do anything but follow obediently. The Elite helped them onto their horses and taking the reins, ran easily alongside with the two dogs.</p>\r\n<p>Ador and a large encampment of gypsies met them on the plateau. </p>\r\n<p>"Finally,” cried Ador, hugging Eiva warmly. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry I didn’t'' come when you asked me, Ador," she said. "All this fuss I''ve caused!"</p>\r\n<p>"You''re here now and safe, that''s all that matters. I can''t thank you enough," he smiled at Ammoel. The Ph''nyr nodded. Ador slipped Eiva’s arm through his and felt her shaking. </p>\r\n<p>"Was it very bad?"</p>\r\n<p>"Not at the time," she lied and was thankful he did not press.</p>\r\n<p>As they walked toward the farmhouse, Ador filled her in on recent events. She was deeply saddened by the deaths of Tielan, the Sharran and, most of all, the boy... Jarok. It was hard to believe she would never see his dear, sweet little face again. She wiped her eyes on her cuff.</p>\r\n<p>"How''s Lara?" she asked.</p>\r\n<p>"As well as can be expected. She and Tielan were to be wed this year."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, Ador. I''m so sorry," she squeezed his arm.</p>\r\n<p>"There''ll be many more Laras'' before this is all over, I fear," replied Ador sadly. "Now come and eat. You must all be hungry." </p>\r\n<p>As the tired and bewildered group retired to their beds in the barn and drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep, Eona lay tossing and turning on her cot. She awoke in a cold sweat, a silent scream of denial clutching her throat. Drained and exhausted, she pushed back her thick, black hair with tired hands that trembled against the moistness of her cheeks. Quietly, so as not to wake Malinka, she rose and moved toward the window. The caravan felt stifling and she pushed it open slightly and breathed deeply. All was still and silent: the camp, the night, and the air. Still and heavy, choking her so that her heart pounded beneath the tight cords across her chest. Carefully she felt for the pot that Malinka always kept warming by the stove and poured herself a mug of the herbal tea. She sat at the table and sipped it slowly. Gradually her racing heart slowed. And the fear in her subsided to a dull ache.</p>\r\n<p>She had received a vision and it had terrified her in its finality. </p>\r\n<p>As acolyte and granddaughter to the previous Sharran she had heard enough visions to know that this one was different, that there was something missing. As a rule, the prophesies of visions always contained a measure of awareness that the future was not set in stone. A comforting sense that what had been revealed was only one possible outcome. That good or bad, the recipient of the vision might, with pre-knowledge either follow the path laid out, or by heeding the warnings therein, make alternative choices and thus avoid it. In short, there was always hope.</p>\r\n<p>But this one held none of that. No hope, no clue as to how what must come to pass could be averted. This one was devoid of everything but inevitability. It was a vision of doom and she did not know what to do about it. Should she tell Gwym and the people that no matter what struggles and hardships they endured, they could not win? No. She could not accept that. There had to be more. She would wait. And so she did. Drinking mug after mug and begging the Lady of Visions to recall her. </p>\r\n<p>The sun rose. She could feel the heat of it on her face as she listened to sounds of the rising camp. Laughing children. Scrapping dogs. Scolding women. The banging of pans and opening doors as the men emerged calling greetings to each other. It was the beginning of new day. ''The beginning of the end'', whispered her aching heart. </p>\r\n<p>Malinka was surprised to see Eona already up. She was even more surprised when Eona told her to admit no one. Malinka reminded her that she had promised to breakfast with Gwym and Eiva that morning and received a stern glare in response.</p>\r\n<p>"No one,” repeated Eona firmly. "Except Tenora." </p>\r\n<p>"As you wish, Sharran," replied Malinka and left to stand watch on the caravan steps where she frowned worriedly. Eona and her father were very close and their breakfasting together had become a ritual she had never known them to miss. Malinka was not happy but she did as she was bid and when Gwym arrived told him Eona was not to be disturbed. </p>\r\n<p>Inside, Eona heard Malinka telling Gwym that the Sharran was not ill, merely busy and would call for him when she was ready to receive him. She turned her thoughts away from the arguing voices (her father was not going to give up that easily) to Tenora. She was hoping that history would repeat itself. That just as she had received the second half of her grandmother’s vision... now, Tenora, would receive the second half of hers. Surely this was why the child had been sent?</p>\r\n<p>Why, after centuries of only one Sharran to lead the people, the gift of ''Sight'' had also been given to another. </p>\r\n<p>Eona'' thoughts drifted to the day following her grandmother’s Felkira when Tenora had arrived. She already knew of the Sharran’s death. She had dreamt it she said, just as she dreamt of Tielan’s, and was ready to take her place. Eona noted the relief in Magra’s face when she realised that Eona had already assumed that place. But the rest of the camp was in uproar, especially when Eona revealed she had no intention of giving way into death for Tenora, as was Tradition, but that Tenora should join her and henceforth there would be two Seers. </p>\r\n<p>The people were torn between Tradition and obedience to the word of the Sharran. There was much dissension and arguing. Gwym did his best to calm them but he was accused of trying to spare his daughter from her duty and feared he was losing the battle. Eona was beginning to think she might well have to concede (though she had never felt less like dying) before some took the matter into their own hands. The consequences of such actions left her cold, for it was forbidden for gipsy to take the life of another gipsy. For one to take the life of a Sharran... she dared not even contemplate it. Thankfully it did not happen.</p>\r\n<p>Fenor had cleverly diffused the situation, pointing out that Tenora had not, as was the way, forgone her physical sight for the gift she had been given. That being so, he argued, Tenora’s gift was not one of Sharran...seer, but of Kirasa... Dreamer. Tenora was not the seer of visions but the dreamer of dreams. That her dreams were unlike those of others was surely a bonus to the people in that they might help the new Sharran... since she was still very young... in guiding the people wisely. The people would still have only one Sharran. The Kirasa would have no authority of her own and be subject, as they all were, to the Sharran. </p>\r\n<p>It was faint and fine line, drawn by playing on details and words and as Gwym. Fenor was accused of trying to protect his daughter &mdash; accusations to which he laughed scornfully.</p>\r\n<p>"To be the father of the Sharran is a great honour, not a punishment, but to force Tenora to assume a station that destiny has not decreed, would be a crime deserving of one.</p>\r\n<p>How can Tenora ''See'' clearly what is to come to pass when her eyes are still fixed in this world? Would you have faith in such a Sharran?" he pointed to the nearest face. "Or you? Or you? Or you?" his finger jumped about the crowd. "Desperate times call for desperate measures. We all need a little help now and again, why should a Sharran be any different, especially one so young, ascended prematurely? If the Lady of Visions does not begrudge sending her this help, who are we to begrudge her accepting it?" </p>\r\n<p>After a long interval of murmured discussions, during which Eona stood tense but proud on the steps of her caravan, the tribes gave her their assent. Hiding her relief within the tight grip she held on Gwym’s hand she had nodded her acknowledgement with the dignity of her station and a raised eyebrow of displeasure at their behaviour, and had been gratified to see the looks of shame and guilt that spread through the crowd. Without a word she had returned to the safety and privacy of her caravan where she had collapsed under the strain.</p>\r\n<p>''Surely all that could not have been for nothing?'' she thought, coming back to the present. ''Surely Tenora would come to her with the news she sought?'' </p>\r\n<p>All day she waited... but Tenora did not come. </p>\r\n<p>Malinka appeared three or four times, offering food which she refused. When she found Eona still seated at the table the next morning, her face set and drawn with dark circles beneath her eyes, Malinka knew she could not allow this to go on. The Sharran was making herself ill. She was already down the caravan steps on her way to fetch Gwym when Eona called her back with a request for a sleeping draught. She had tried to sleep, she told the now fussing Malinka, but had stupidly allowed herself to become over-tired. Eona smiled dutifully as Malinka scolded her for not letting her help sooner. When Eona replied that she did not like to disturb her, Malinka tutted saying that it was her job to look after the Sharran... not the other way round. Had Malinka had the remotest idea of what Eona was planning, she would not have been humming happily to herself as she handed her the sleeping draught but would have slapped the mug away. </p>\r\n<p>Eona however revealed nothing of her plans, with either word or look. Innocently, she downed the brew and with a weary smile of gratitude lay back on her pillows as Malinka pulled across the thick blanket that divided the sleeping area from the rest of the room. Eona felt herself beginning to relax as the draught took hold. Strangely she had been filled not with despair and defeat when it became obvious Tenora was not going to come, but with an overwhelming stubbornness that she would not allow her people to be dealt marked cards. And so, with a highly charged sense of determination and demand for justice, she had set herself upon this course. A course that went against all she had been taught and knew. </p>\r\n<p>It was forbidden for a Sharran to try to force the manifestation of a vision. As far as she knew it had never been attempted but, she reasoned with herself, she had already flown in the face of tradition twice... what was once more? Third time lucky... as the saying went. Her eyelids grew heavy. As she felt herself been drawn into the depths of sleep she felt a wave of trepidation wash over her and she questioned her rashness. Her fingers stroked the sliver of jet in the golden torque about her neck. She was doing the right thing she repeated, calming herself. Her senses faded and she slept.</p>\r\n<p>She was floating peacefully, allowing herself to be pulled into the realm of dreams. She heard her grandmother’s voice pleading with her to turn away from her path. She ignored it. Tielan called her to play but she averted her gaze, struggling with her desire to look upon her beloved brother again. Scene after scene unfolded. She resisted their lure and walked on until at last, her steadfastness was rewarded and the Mists of Sight surrounded her. She shivered. They were cold and unwelcoming. Resolutely she called out then waited for the Lady of Visions to come to her. There was only an angry silence. Summoning all her courage into what she hoped was a justified defiance, she did the unthinkable... she reached out, tore open the veil of mist and stepped through alone.</p>\r\n<p>And was immediately confronted by a scream of outrage.</p>\r\n<p>"How dare you! What do you mean by coming here un-summoned?" demanded the woman whose presence burst upon Eona like a lashing storm. Eona stared at her. She was beautiful beyond comprehension. Dressed in finest white silk, with golden hair so long that she carried it draped over one arm and features that were sculpted to exquisite perfection. Yet this loveliness was marred by the cold hardness of her eyes &mdash; arrogant and devoid of any pity or compassion. Eona'' resolve began to falter under their steely, ice blue glare.</p>\r\n<p>"I... I," she swallowed, unable to think of a thing to say. Her knees buckled and tears slipped from her frightened eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"She dares because she is brave and strong and will not abandon her people without a fight," another voice answered for her and another woman appeared, identical in look and dress but with eyes as warm and gentle as a doe. The gaze she bestowed upon Eona was soft and full of love and Eona felt her strength returning.</p>\r\n<p>"Hope,” exclaimed the first in surprise. "I thought you had more than enough to keep you occupied?"</p>\r\n<p>"I know you did," replied Hope, with a knowing smile that brought guilty flush to the others'' cheeks. "But the call of this child was too loud to ignore."</p>\r\n<p>"Look what she did," cried the first, attempting to turn the attention away from herself.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing that cannot be mended," observed Hope.</p>\r\n<p>"But she has broken all the Laws. She has defied me," the woman’s voice rose petulantly.</p>\r\n<p>"True, she has broken the Law. But if you had not acted against the Rules it would not have been necessary. Fate and Hope, we are committed to walk together."</p>\r\n<p>"You were not here," Fate tried to dismiss her own wrongdoing.</p>\r\n<p>"Then you should have waited," retorted Hope.</p>\r\n<p>"Our Father... Time... must be obeyed," countered Fate, smiling triumphantly when Hope was forced to concede the point. "The fact is, this mortal was granted her vision and yet demands more. She is insolent and forward. She has broken the Law and insulted me. Father,” she threw back her head and cried. "I demand retribution!"</p>\r\n<p>Instantly Eona was left gasping on the floor, wracked in agonizing pain. The mists of time swelled thickly around her helpless body, wave after wave crashing over and through her, tearing at her being and draining her spirit. Hope bowed her head in sorrow until Eona lifted her face, eyes pleading for help. </p>\r\n<p>"Enough,” she cried, stepping between Eona and the rushing wind and shielding her. "Father, I beg you!" </p>\r\n<p>The wind ceased and the pain was gone. Eona kissed Hopes'' hand and thanked her.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you, my child. Had you not risked all, I fear I should have been too late. Now, come and see what I offer. You have paid a high enough price for it."</p>\r\n<p>Worlds away, Malinka’s piercing howl brought the whole camp rushing to the Sharran’s caravan. Many backed away, muttering and making signs to ward off evil. Gwym forced his way through and stared in shocked horror at his daughter. Eiva was not far behind and immediately hustled the crowd out of the room and shut the door. Striding passed the frozen Gwym she slapped the still hysterical Malinka forcefully across the face and pushed her into a chair, and then, taking a deep breath to steady herself, she moved to tend to Eona.</p>\r\n<p>"Gwym,” she shouted impatiently. "Snap out of it man and come help me." </p>\r\n<p>"Leave her alone," snapped Gwym curtly, lifting her roughly aside. </p>\r\n<p>Eiva gasped at his manhandling of her. Gwym apologised and explained that Eona was in the throes of a vision and to disturb her could be very dangerous. Eiva stared at the figure in wonder.</p>\r\n<p>"Is this her first then? Is it normal for this to happen?" she asked, and then called herself all the silly fools. Would Malinka have reacted thus if it were?</p>\r\n<p>"No." Gwym’s voice shook and his chin trembled as he flung himself into the nearest chair and dropped his head onto the table. Eiva sat down beside him, her gaze drifting past to where Eona lay and then back again. How could one family have so much pain in so short a time? She wanted to reach out and comfort him but she knew there was nothing she could say or do that would ease his grief. A lump rose in her own throat and she closed her eyes against the pitiful sight, covering her mouth with her hand to force back her tears. They remained thus for what seemed a lifetime until at last they heard Eona call softly for Malinka. Gwym was there before her, cradling Eona in his arms, crushing her fiercely until she could scarcely breathe.</p>\r\n<p>"Father?" she gasped. "What are you doing here?"</p>\r\n<p>"Thank the Mother,” cried Gwym. "I thought I had lost you too."</p>\r\n<p>"Lost me? What... " She stopped. </p>\r\n<p>Hopes'' words echoed through her mind... ''You have paid a high price.'' </p>\r\n<p>She pushed herself out of Gwym’s arms and raised her hands to her face. To his surprise she seemed neither alarmed or dismayed but merely asked in a calm voice.</p>\r\n<p>"How much did he take?"</p>\r\n<p>Eiva gazed sadly at the snow-white hair, the wrinkled face and the blue veins beginning to show through the thinning skin.</p>\r\n<p>"About fifty or sixty years, my dear," she told Eona gently when neither Gwym nor Malinka seemed inclined to answer. </p>\r\n<p>"It could have been worse," Eona mused stoically. "She wanted it all!"</p>\r\n<p>Eiva marvelled at the strength and composure of this child. She reminded the old woman very much of Jarok. Tears misted her eyes. She bent and kissed the top of Eona’s head.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll get you some tea," she whispered as Gwym suddenly bombarded his daughter with questions.</p>\r\n<p>"Who? Why? What did you do?" he babbled confused.</p>\r\n<p>"Fate. Took my lifespan. Because I demanded a vision... another one to be precise," she replied bluntly. </p>\r\n<p>"You did what,” he shouted incredulously. "Of all the... "</p>\r\n<p>"You forget yourself, Father," Eona cut in tersely, not feeling up to coping with Gwym’s anger right then. "Please go and fetch Ador and Ammoel." </p>\r\n<p>Gwym glared at her fiercely for the summary dismissal then he clenched his teeth together and went to do as he had been told. Eiva placed a mug of tea in Eona’s hands.</p>\r\n<p>"Drink it while it''s hot."</p>\r\n<p>"Is Malinka not here?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, but she''s next to useless at the moment I''m afraid. You gave us all a rare fright!"</p>\r\n<p>By the time Gwym got back with Ador and Ammoel, Eona was sitting at the table, eating hungrily. Though Gwym had warned them it was still something of a shock to see the change in Eona and they gratefully accepted her offer of some wine to steady their nerves.</p>\r\n<p>When she had eaten her fill and the table cleared, Eona began. </p>\r\n<p>"Two days ago I received a vision. I saw a rat. But a strange rat was this. Tall as a man</p>\r\n<p>and as a man, it moved upright on two feet as it crept furtively along a maze of stairs and corridors. Coming to the end, it picked up a corner and folded the maze in half &mdash; stairs and corridors bending in on themselves. Shrinking and disappearing until they were no more than a small piece of parchment slipped into the pocket of a youth. I followed the youth to Symtar where he gave the parchment to the Powerwielder. In that moment I felt the Earth crack and shatter and I fell into a wide void, floating high above a world that was full of emptiness. </p>\r\n<p>Five moons circled this world &mdash; four of them shining brightly, one blue, one red, one green, one purple. The fifth pulsed but faintly, in burnished gold, and upon its surface was carved the likeness of the Powerwielder. Round and round they spun, drawing ever closer until there was only the world. No longer empty but shining with a radiant light. But alas, it was not pure. It was tainted and spoiled, for at its core rested the black seed of evil. </p>\r\n<p>And from that seed grew an elf, with a heart black as the darkness that spawned it, or even blacker. Laughing triumphantly, he raised the parchment above his head. Then opening his mouth, he swallowed it and with it all the light that the world contained. As the last drop disappeared the voice of Creation cried out in pain... Too Late!"</p>\r\n<p>No- one spoke. </p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere about the table was so thick it could be cut. Even to the untrained, the message was clear. They were doomed to failure. They stared at each other’s white faces, seeing their own reflected in eyes wide with shock and disbelief. Despair and despondency settled like indigestion within their chests. The wine bottle clinked against the rim of the glass as Ador shakily poured himself another drink and filled the glasses of the others.</p>\r\n<p>"Now you understand, Father. Why I did what I did. Why I had to do it!" Eona rose and walked to the window. "I waited. For two days I waited to see if another vision would come, if not to me, then perhaps to Tenora. Then I knew. Somehow, I knew there would be no more unless I sought it for myself. So I sought... and I paid the price." She could feel their sadness and pity, filling the awkward silence louder than the words that none wanted to utter. She spun to face them, laughing when they gasped in bewildered shock at the beaming smile on her lips. "You think me mad? No. It''s not madness come upon me. But Hope. I found it! I found it,” she cried excitedly and hurried back to her seat. Taking a calming breath she recalled the second of her visions:</p>\r\n<p>"I was standing beside the gates of Symtar. A man stood next to me. A man dressed all in black. He offered me his hand and when I took it, he led me to a place where the trees grow on silver trunks and the great bear prowls. There he met two others: one, a gypsy with three scars on the back of his left hand, the other, an elf who wore a cloak of green ivy. They were on their way to find the youth who had the parchment. We went with them. The man in black held out his hand and the youth placed the parchment in it. From beneath his cloak the man pulled forth the world and the five moons. And the world was empty." Eona waited quietly, knowing they needed time to take in what they had just heard, to think it over and understand it... and to allow for her fathers'' inevitable objections. They were not long in coming.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not going anywhere," he refused flatly.</p>\r\n<p>"You must."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s out of the question. You need me here... especially now."</p>\r\n<p>"I may have grown older but I''m not feeble or confined to my bed yet. And even if I were, I have Malinka... and Eiva," she added as she felt the old woman take her hand supportively.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t care. I''m not leaving you here alone and that''s final,” he thumped the table angrily.</p>\r\n<p>But his anger was nothing compared to Eona’s. Eiva watched in amazement as bright red spots appeared in her cheeks, her back stiffened and her head snapped up. With a frightening serenity of presence, she deliberately pushed herself to her feet. Her sightless eyes stared with uncanny precision directly into Gwym’s and pinned him to his seat. With a haughty tilt to her chin she leant slightly forward. The room became charged with tension as they waited for her to speak. When she did her tone was soft, yet ringing forcefully in absolute authority.</p>\r\n<p>"You will hold your tongue and never... never... behave in such a manner towards me again.</p>\r\n<p>My father you may be... but I am your Sharran and you will accord me the respect and obedience that is my right. Is that clear?"</p>\r\n<p>Eiva, Ador and Ammoel held their breaths, looking everywhere but at the pair as Father and Daughter clashed wills with Sharran and Gipsy. It was a short contest, of which there could really only be one winner. Gwym bowed his head.</p>\r\n<p>"As you wish Sharran. I offer my most humble apologies," he replied and taking hold of her hand, kissed her wrist, as was the custom. Then he gazed about the table, not in embarrassment but with eyes shining with pride.</p>\r\n<p>"I wish... " Eona began hesitantly, her toned easing as she twisted her hand into his and held it tightly. "... I wish it didn''t have to be you. I''ll miss you. But the vision was clear," her voice caught at the back of her throat as the similarity between this moment and her grandmother’s forced choice hit her and her understanding of the old Sharran’s torment suddenly became crystal clear. She offered a silent prayer that this time, the outcome would be different. She felt Gwym’s hand tighten around her own. He understood. It made the bearing a little easier. </p>\r\n<p>"Ador shall take charge in your stead," she said, lowering herself into her chair.</p>\r\n<p>Ador almost choked on his wine. Eiva patted him roughly on the back with a whisper that he would be wise not to argue.</p>\r\n<p>"Fenor will be appointed to help you. The people have great respect for you Ador. You will do just fine," Eona assured the coughing man. "Father, you will speak to Fenor this night. If he has any questions, he may come to me."</p>\r\n<p>"He won''t. He''s a good man."</p>\r\n<p>"There''s little time. The message of the visions is clear. The Powerwielder must not receive this parchment. Malinka will prepare packs for you both. Good luck, Father. Good luck, Ammoel. You will leave at dawn." </p>\r\n<p>Up until this point Ammoel had watched everything with interest but had been left wondering what any of it had to do with him and why he had been asked to attend. Now he stared at Eona in amazement. He was a Ph''nyr in the Elven Elite... not a gypsy, subject to this Sharran... however much he admired her. He opened his mouth to raise his objections then, catching the warning shake of Eiva’s head out of the corner of his eye, realised he would simply be wasting his breath... not to mention risking a great dent in his pride.</p>\r\n<p>"As you wish Sharran," he conceded politely.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 23, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:04', 1, '2012-03-16 15:21:06');

The screams and shouts of the dying and panicked intruded upon his righteous tirade, earning them not respite but further punishment.</p>\r\n<p>"Fools! Morons! Useless turns of simpering idiots! Putrid offspring of worm-sucking slime spits! She would be here by now if I were not forced to rely on such ineptitude as yours."</p>\r\n<p>He pulled at his frizzing hair as the sight of the burning camp brought a measure of control to his demented mood.</p>\r\n<p>"Now see what you''ve made me do," he screamed out the window, sending another angry fire-bolt hurtling down before dragging himself back inside. </p>\r\n<p>The scrolls with black runes lying on the table caught his eye. In a second, they were no more than ashes.</p>\r\n<p>It was they... they who imprisoned him here. </p>\r\n<p>It was they... who had deceived him, promised him all without telling him the true cost. </p>\r\n<p>It was they...&nbsp;who had entrapped and enslaved him within these walls, forcing him to rely on incompetence. </p>\r\n<p>They probably knew a way that he could leave... but they would never tell him. </p>\r\n<p>They wanted him to fail... if he succeeded, the tables would be turned and it would be they that bore the yoke of his domination. </p>\r\n<p>Yes, he convinced himself. They knew of a way he could break loose the chains of Ak''thai. He would make them tell! </p>\r\n<p>He was almost at the door when the first warning rumbles caused the room to shudder. He ignored them. The touch of his hand on the doorknob sent him hurtling back across the room. His back hit the table and he fell in a heap. Suddenly he was lifted, spinning, off the floor and even after he stopped, the room continued to whirl before his eyes. The air grew heavy, pressing in on him, squeezing the breath from his lungs. Angry whispers filled his ears with warnings, threats, and promises. </p>\r\n<p>For the first time since they had recruited him, the runes banded together against him. He fought back but they were too powerful for him to overcome, even though they were but a few. Afterwards he would realise his mistake. That when he had burnt their images on the scrolls he had released their magic. </p>\r\n<p>Now however, he knew only that his head was buzzing, his vision gone and his lungs burning. His resistance grew weaker as each defeat increasing their strength. It was futile to keep trying. So (though it cut him to the core to do it) like any self-respecting minion at the mercy of its master... he grovelled, pleaded, promised ever to be faithful and obedient in the future. Their grip tightened... he begged for mercy. Finally convinced of his sincerity, the runes released him. For long moments he knelt, subservient and gasping, before the dark, shadowy manifestation towering over him. The loosening of the neck of his robe, as his body took in great gulps of reviving air, disguised the motions of his flying fingers. His mind muttered furiously behind closed eyelids. Suddenly he sprang to his feet, the final word of the spell hissing from drawn back lips. The air turned green as links of crackling energy formed a chain of restraint around the manifestation. Their rage spilled out through the gaps of the hastily woven spell, igniting the air. Black flames licked hungrily at the abundance of energy released by the confrontation. The links of the chain began to bend as the flame ate into it, as rust on metal, but by now Duman was fully recovered and, dousing the flames with a single wave of his hand, he set the spell a second time.</p>\r\n<p>With the runes now safely restrained, Duman called forth his own. Taking his time he separated one rune at a time and with care, precision and great enjoyment, exacted the severest punishment on each before sending it back to the Black dimension. A joyous laugh heralded his final victory and the return of his good humour.</p>\r\n<p>He had, he realised now his mind was sober, been wasting his anger. The girl could not stay locked in Phelise forever. She had to come out sometime and he would be waiting. That is to say, his Shadow would be waiting and in that... he had full confidence, for was it not a part of himself? With his own intelligence and reason, with his own criteria and purpose, with his own mind, to think for itself without having to be led and ordered.</p>\r\n<p>Oh yes! She would be his, sooner or later. </p>\r\n<p>He would have preferred sooner but, he shrugged, he had waited this long, what was a week or so here or there? </p>\r\n<p>It was a week that ended in the report of a large group of goblins that had been crushed by a falling tree. On the surface it sounded no more than an unfortunate accident &mdash; a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Duman knew better. He had felt the enormous tension stretching along the lines of the astral planes; had felt the jerk of release; had almost physically heard the resonant ''twang'' as the Power had been unleashed. His Power!</p>\r\n<p>He had raged all day and for days thereafter. Mutilating, torturing, destroying everything he set his eyes on in a vain attempt to vent his fury.</p>\r\n<p>He did not eat. He did not sleep. </p>\r\n<p>Round and round he paced the endless maze of corridors and stairways of Ak''thai. Mumbling and muttering to himself, he fell ever deeper into his depression, pulling it as a cloak of madness over his shoulders. His eyes were sunken black holes in his head, emphasized by the prominent ridge of his permanent frown. His features grew gaunt and skeletal, with paper- thin skin stretched tightly across his bones. Each day it became worse. Nothing remained unscathed from his increasing insanity &mdash; be it animate or inanimate, living or dead. As the endless screams echoing with excruciating horror through the deserted corridors testified.</p>\r\n<p>Well-versed in the wizard’s moods, Kretos had wisely made himself scarce. Ever the whipping boy, even during Duman’s better days, he had no intention of ending up dead. But he watched him carefully, the eyes and ears of his family keeping him informed of every word and deed it was possible for them to know. Ever since his brief encounter with Velkaan, he had begun to develop a strange and unsettling interest (for he refused to admit it might be concern) for the two-legs. A feeling that grew, especially for the safety of Velkaan, as the news filtered back to him that Rohansuk was in a state of disorder and terror. </p>\r\n<p>Kretos knew the goblins flowed from their tunnels each night, wreaking havoc and mayhem upon the innocent, murdering, burning and consuming all they could. Whole colonies of two-legs had been wiped from the face of the land with nothing but scorched earth and ashes to say they had ever been. As far as Duman’s reports went, none had escaped. Kretos knew otherwise. A handful of the extremely lucky had managed to evade the slaughter and these were beginning to band together. But they were few and far between and Kretos was puzzled by the lack of any purposeful response from the two-legs. Surely they had leaders of some kind, armies to send out. Yet only a mere handful of soldiers galloped back and forth across the land, doing their best to reassure and defend the people against the foe but their numbers were laughingly inadequate and dwindling rapidly. He simply could not understand why the two-legs were being so slow to react. Why they were not organizing and confronting the obvious danger. Why they allowed Duman to grow stronger each day, whilst they sat back and did nothing. He shook his head in bewilderment. The rat on his knee squeaked in annoyance.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ve been over this time and again," said Kretos patiently, stroking his brothers'' head with his finger. "I care no more for them than you do. But we need them. And we must help them. Once Duman has finished with them it''ll be our turn and we can''t fight him alone. That''s my only interest."</p>\r\n<p>The rat wiggled his whiskers. He did not believe it. And in truth, neither did Kretos, who breathed deeply to quieten his racing heart.</p>\r\n<p>"Enough of that," he said sharply. "Is there any news from Willoway?"</p>\r\n<p>The rats'' reply was cut off by a string of curses that echoed down the tunnel.</p>\r\n<p>"The Master is back!" Kreto’s sneer of hate turned the title into an insult as the voice continued.</p>\r\n<p>"KRETOS! You snivelling son of pus-ridden skudworm! Show yourself!"</p>\r\n<p>When he reached the opening of the tunnel, Kretos bowed his back, dropped his head and, twisting his hands together nervously as he played the part of the cringing minion, stepped into the wizard’s view. </p>\r\n<p>"Y... y... yes M... m... master?" He stammered back up the central well.</p>\r\n<p>"Where have you been hiding, wart-face?" Duman glared down at him with disgust.</p>\r\n<p>"N... nowhere M... master. Just been b... b... busy with things," replied Kretos, eyes darting back and forth from the wizard’s face to the floor.</p>\r\n<p>"What things?" Duman demanded, his tone thick with suspicion. His hand moved in a quick but intricate pattern and immediately, Kretos was held within a constraining spell and floated upwards to face level. Kretos stared at the wizard with a fear that was not entirely feigned. Duman need only use one word, one gesture, to send him to his death... or worse, to cast a spell that would have Kretos telling all. Beneath the paralysing grip of magic, Kretos shuddered and shook. Sweat trickled down his temples. Was this the end? Apparently not, for the wizard’s face relaxed and his eyes, whilst not exactly softening, grew less hard.</p>\r\n<p>"Never mind. I really care little for whatever pathetic trivialities you do for amusement. Fetch me some food. I''m hungry," ordered Duman flinging Kretos against the nearest wall as he released the spell. Kretos picked himself up, ignoring the blood dripping from his split lip and scurried off.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh! Kretos!"</p>\r\n<p>Kretos skidded to a halt, flinching at the sickly-sweet tone he knew all too well and which he also knew better than to ignore. He turned slowly. The fireball was already on its way and he only just managed to duck his head in time. Even so, it singed a path along the top of his head, burning off his hair and leaving a livid, red welt. He froze, unable to trust himself, and kept his eyes fixed on Duman’s slippered feet, watching while they turned and move away with the fading notes of sadistic laughter. Only then did he lift his eyes. Eyes that burned with hatred so deep and pure, tears spilled down his cheeks &mdash; hatred so hungry it consumed his common sense. He drew a finger across his throat.</p>\r\n<p>"One day,” he whispered venomously. "One day!"</p>\r\n<p>Frantic squeaking in his ear brought him to with a jolt and with a soft curse he resumed his disguise. How could he have been so stupid? His family were not the only eyes and ears within the fortress. There was many a minion that would be eager and willing to upgrade their position at Kreto’s expense. With furtive glances for any sign of spying eyes, Kretos hurried off to the kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>Some time later, Duman sat in the Summoning chamber staring into the endless, empty depths of the Orb. How he longed for the day when the cold, clear crystal no longer stood between himself and the true, physical touch of the power but for now, he must settle for placing his hand upon its smooth surface and activating the Orb. A mist began to form &mdash; pale pink mist, swirling and churning with agitated discontent. His long nails clicked against the crystal as he tightened his grip. The mist slowed and deepened to the colour of rich wine that stained the inner surface of the Orb. Duman took a deep breath then placed the thumb of his right hand against his right temple and the fingers just beneath his left eye. They kneaded the flesh covering the lower portion of his eye socket until they found the exact position, and then applied a gentle pressure. His eyes rolled up into his head and a soft moan escaped his slightly parted lips as he searched within himself for the unique, psychic resonance of his existence amongst the countless others that vibrated along the threads and chords of the astro-dimensional cortex. Locating it, he isolated it, blocking out all sound from the rest. His lips summoned the rune, Dhukma. It appeared in the air before him, black as the void, and he reached out to it. With one hand on the rune and the other on the Orb, he slowly drew upon magic and power. His body jerked convulsively as the warring energies clashed within his centre. Again his hand tightened on the Orb and Soleb’s resistance faded. Magic and power merged into one and Duman felt his being swell along the astral planes. A faint, transparent apparition took form behind closed eyelids and using the direction given him by the ghostly figure, Duman let his mind flow, searching for an echoing signature to his own. For the same psychic frequency, though of a more hollow pitch, that belonged to his Shadow. </p>\r\n<p>He found it far away and motionless. Somewhere nearby, he sensed the unmistakable harmonics that marked the gateways to Phelise. Satisfied and unsatisfied both, he pulled back. The ghostly apparition floated back with him and wrapping his psyche around it, he absorbed it into himself. With tremendous effort, Duman drew a veil down between the two energies. A rapid flexing of his fingers and the rune dissipated. </p>\r\n<p>It was a while longer before he released the Orb. The warm, whirling essence teased and tormented his tingling palm beneath the cold surface. Unable to resist its lure, he placed his other hand upon it, staring deeply to its core. Mesmerised, his vision shrank until nothing existed but the enticing, surging reds that called to him. His breathing slowed, his body still as death and twice as cold. A small, black dot appeared within the centre of the crimson mist, appeared, and then blinked out as Duman came to his senses. Such unprecedented action would have Soleb asking unwanted questions. A rasping gasp forced life back into his body and he dismissed the Dragon and released his hands from the Orb immediately. Returning to his tower room, Duman pondered his information.</p>\r\n<p>The girl had left the Elfin homeland, what else could account for the surge of power he had sensed along the astral planes?</p>\r\n<p>But if she had left Phelise, why had the Shadow failed to follow? </p>\r\n<p>What was it waiting for? </p>\r\n<p>Though Duman was confident in the Shadows'' abilities, he could not restrain the flutters of anxiety that it was not pursuing its prey. </p>\r\n<p>Had something happened to it?</p>\r\n<p>He snorted self-deprecatingly. What feeble-mindedness possessed him? </p>\r\n<p>If such had been the case, he would have found no trace of its psychic resonance.</p>\r\n<p>So then what? </p>\r\n<p>The obvious answer was that the wretched child had left by another gate. This being the case, he had to find some way of getting this information to the Shadow. He poured himself a goblet of wine and settled at his desk, with quill and parchment, to begin the arduous task of devising a spell that would be compatible with those already contained within the Shadow. It would be a complicated business. It needed to be subtle enough to slip in unawares and yet, once there, strong enough to penetrate the Shadows'' will. He also needed to keep the spell in stasis within the mind of whoever, or whatever, he sent as carrier... for he could not cast such a one over so great a distance without a conduit and since the demise of the harpy, there were none that he trusted with such knowledge. The belief in his omnipotence was the basis of the fear beneath which his minions trembled.</p>\r\n<p>The throbbing of his temples and blurring of his vision, as he gazed in frustration at the growing mountain of discarded parchments, finally led him to his couch. He lay back with a sigh. He would try again after a short nap to clear his head but before he slept, he had one more thing to do. Initiating the contact spell with the few remaining Sectii, he used their eyes to scour the area wherein they waited for any sign of the girl. There was none. Too tired to search further, he freed them from the previous orders, telling them they need do no more than hunt and feed wherever and whenever they desired, stipulating only that each take one point of the compass.</p>\r\n<p>As the stones of Ak''thai settled to the faint, rhythmic heartbeat of the now sleeping wizard, the Summoning Orb burst into rainbow ebullience. As always it was Tareb who brought reason to their euphoria and his voice calmed the whirling mass as he coated the inner surface of the Orb with a soothing coat of azure blue.</p>\r\n<p>“Be calm brothers... and swift,” he cautioned. “He doth sleep but lightly. We art too close to throw it all away now. Soleb, hast thou word?” </p>\r\n<p>Crimson brilliance deepened to maroon disappointment.</p>\r\n<p>“Yushok reveals only that the Lady Alyse hath returned from Phelise and moves eastward. Of her precise plans he saith he knowest nothing.” </p>\r\n<p>“Lies!”</p>\r\n<p>Verdant anger flared. The brothers smothered it quickly, their pulsing essence filled with a mix of compassionate understanding and displeasure.</p>\r\n<p>“Thine volatile temper shalt be our undoing,” Baroth warned Felnath. “And thine accusation hath no basis. Yushok hath never born us false before. Why wouldst he do so now?” </p>\r\n<p>“Because she cometh not and he is afeared to tell us,” retorted Felnath swiftly but in a calmer tone.</p>\r\n<p>“Thou makest no sense brother,” Turquoise bemusement flickered over jade indignation. </p>\r\n<p>“Yushok hath nothing to fear from us. Even shouldst we feel so inclined, we art powerless here.”Mayhap he hath chosen not to know. Yushok mayest prevaricate upon occasion but I hath never known him to lie. “Tis possible he hath kept himself in deliberate ignorance. What he knoweth not, he canst not tell... “</p>\r\n<p>“Why wouldst he doeth such a thing?” Lavender confusion swirled thickly and was streaked through with cerise understanding.</p>\r\n<p>“As Tareb hath warned, we art too close to throw it away now. We hath ridden the steed of Lady Luck safely down the centuries but he couldst discover our secret at any moment and then all our knowledge wouldst be his. We canst ill-afford to deliver the Lady Alyse straight into his hands.” </p>\r\n<p>“Then, for all our sakes, we must press Yushok no more.” Tareb advised firmly.</p>\r\n<p>“I bow to thine wisdom brother... and apologise for mine suspicions of Yushok. He hath indeed been a true and faithful friend and is undeserving of them.” </p>\r\n<p>“Be strong Felnath. Soon, we shalt be free.”</p>\r\n<p>The multi-coloured essences of his brothers flowed over the soft, pastel hues of the contrite Felnath with patient compassion. Of them all, because of his nature, Felnath suffered the most. They were aware of this and did their best to remain tolerant of his outbursts. Suddenly, the inner surface of the Orb was awash with vivid scarlet. All motion within it stilled.</p>\r\n<p>“That which doth watch is here... and it is friend.” Soleb’s flush of certainty was far beyond the human spectrum.</p>\r\n<p>“How canst thou be so sure?” asked Tareb. “Even now I canst sense no more than a slight presence.” </p>\r\n<p>“Because this time I didst hear it. One word it doth repeat, over and over. Danger!”</p>\r\n<p>Duman paced the labyrinth of corridors in deep cogitation. His hands clasped behind his back, his head bowed and his lips whispering unintelligibly as he searched the depths of his knowledge for the configuration of the spell he required. Corridor after corridor he wandered aimlessly. Every so often his head would snap up, his eyes alive with hope only to fade again as he re-thought the possibility and found it flawed. More than once he had stopped outside the Summoning chamber. This time he opened the door. The vacant Orb pulsed dimly. His hand stroked the sensitive stone of the wall. It was still and quiet, nothing to explain why his feet kept bringing here other than the fact that his desire for the Dragon’s power was ever on his mind. Still, he had promised himself to set extra guards on the Orb rooms.</p>\r\n<p>"Later," he told his feet, pulling the door closed.</p>\r\n<p>He walked quickly to his Casting room. Amongst the many discarded scrolls he at last found something that, with a little tweaking here and there, would provide the solution to his other problem. </p>\r\n<p>Green mist swirled about the boundaries of the pentagram in which Duman stood. It rose upwards, searching every molecule of air for a means to penetrate the mystical barrier between itself and the wizard. Finding none it floated back down, drained of the energy to sustain its ascent, and then rose again to search anew. Untiring. Ceaseless, like waves upon the shore, it persisted. Infinitely patient, infinitely persevering in its constant testing of the mystic shield, Duman closed his eyes so that the hypnotic whorls no longer teased along the periphery of his vision, threatening to undo his concentration. Whilst the spell itself was well within the bounds of his skill and required very little by way of mental exertion on his part, the distance over which he was about to cast it would call for his maximum attention, will and strength... if it was not to go awry. Not that he was concerned by the possible consequences a rogue spell might have on the outside world but each failure in casting cost the wielder a part of himself that might never be regained. </p>\r\n<p>Breathing deeply, Duman drew himself inwards and downwards, to the shrivelled, black stone of his heart and spirit wherein rested the core of his magic. It had grown enormously since the seed had first sprouted &mdash; his many victories over the black runes having increased its volume and knowledge. He was strong, strong enough to penetrate the restrictions of the fortress mentally, if not physically, and to reach across the leagues that separated him from his subject. His hands traced the figure of the rune that bore his own name. The protective shield hummed as the magic awakened and the rune appeared, suspended in the air only a hands'' span from his face. His head tilted slightly, rolling on his neck as he drew from the blackness within. He felt the magic rise, rushing eagerly to be free. It burst forth in a screaming command that stabbed into the rune like a sword and was transfixed by the power contained therein. The parchment for his spell being complete, Duman set about preparing the message.</p>\r\n<p>From deep in his memory he pulled forth the image of the northern gateway of Phelise. The gateway set in the craggy, uninviting slopes of the Borinian Heights. Cold and barren, save for the scantest of vegetation that not even the rugged mountain goat could be bothered to climb for. He envisioned the sun rising to the right of it, speeding across the sky and dipping low to fade out of sight to the left. Far below, scrub grass and thistles thinned to give way to tall pine forests. Above, the snow-clad crest of the mountains glistened and twinkled like stars in the night. Every thought, every memory, manifested itself in the open palm of his hand and when he opened his eyes he felt the breath catch in his throat as he gazed upon a sight he had not seen for centuries. The way home! </p>\r\n<p>He swallowed his longing ruthlessly as he drew from his pocket a piece of the mighty horn broken from the stone body of Ecos held captive in Ak''thai. He called forth another rune and with it smashed the horn into a fine dust with which he coated the image he had created. Then, creating a rift in the rune he had prepared with a small twist of his fingers, he blew the contents of his palm into it. When the last particle of dust had disappeared he quickly closed the rent he had torn. Closing his eyes once more, he reached out and clasped the rune in a mental grip so tight that its presence faded from the room. He activated the connection spell with one of the surviving Sectii. </p>\r\n<p>It was dark. Thick cloud obscured the moon so that he had trouble orientating. He needed some kind of landmark. He ordered the Sectus into the air, flying in ever increasing circles as he used its eyes to search the ground below. The lights of Talgheer reflected off the Westbrooke. Duman set the Sectus down with the river at its back and the city to its right. Using an amended version of the original binding spell through which he was connected to the Shadow, Duman commanded the Sectus to search for it by following their shared resonance.&nbsp;This done, Duman drew himself back along the paths of magic, using enormous energies and will to retain his increasingly tenuous contact with the Sectus, and returned his consciousness to Ak''thai. </p>\r\n<p>The green mist had now completely engulfed the shield inside which he stood and which was vibrating shrill warnings that its limits were being severely tested. Duman knew he had little time to spare. If the energies in the mist were to contact those now throbbing within the door to the connecting dimensions would implode and he and all within Ak’thai would be sucked inside. He stretched out his arms. Summoning the necessary configuration of runes he uttered the incantation of the travelling spell, that would send the command and instructions contained within his rune into the Sectus'' psyche, there to lay dormant until the Shadows'' possession of it activated them. Slowly he brought his open palms together. Struggling in a battle of wills and strength with each successive rune that he bent and twisted, moulded, conformed, and merged into the next, until the spell was complete and he thrust his hands forwards sending the spell down the thin thread of magic that bound the Sectus to himself. He allowed his psyche to be carried with it. </p>\r\n<p>In the physical world his lungs began to burn and bleed, his rasping breaths torn hot and sticky from his constricting throat. His knees buckled and he fell to the ground, the shield about him bending and buckling as his weakening state struggled to maintain it. Duman gritted his teeth and held on, ignoring the sneering laughter that drifted from the dark depths of the Black Realm, as those that dwelt there anticipated his failure and prepared to pounce. His hands curled into fists and punched the stone relentlessly, using the pain of abused knuckles to feed his consciousness and stop himself from passing out. At last, after what seemed an eternity, he knew that his casting had been successful and with a scream of relief and triumph, severed his connection to Sectus.</p>\r\n<p>Almost immediately his strength began to return. He sat cross-legged on the floor and fell into deep meditation, reabsorbing the magic that had escaped during the castings. Not until it was all was gone and the pentagram was clear, did Duman release the shield. The green mist fell hungrily into the empty space left by the absent barrier, covering Duman like a green skin. He breathed deeply, sucking in its welcoming and now harmless magic to replenish his dwindled strength. The little that escaped receded from his presence. Hungry and disappointed it seeped back into the stone of Ak''thai.</p>\r\n<p>Even though much of his strength had returned, the casting had taken its toll on his body. His fingers were stiff and aching, his skin wrinkled with age and he felt the stooping bow of his shoulders as left the room. Inordinately weary, he needed more than mere food and rest and so made his way to the deep underground cavern where the door to the Life fire was secreted. Soon he was luxuriating in the black flames, being rejuvenated inside and out. He emerged reluctantly from their seductive caresses, a young man of a mere twenty or so human years, and sent the Life fire back into its own dimension. With a soft word and a flick of his fingers he stood, once again, outside the Summoning Chamber.</p>\r\n<p>The door swung open and he stepped across the threshold, pausing to relax into the peaceful harmony of the resonating stone of the room as it clicked shut behind him. The darkness was illuminated only by the dull throb of light emanating from the Orb, softening the thick black to a subtle blend of grey. He ran his hand across the pentagram marked table and up the carved legs of the tripod upon which the Orb rested. Nothing. They were undisturbed and untroubled. He sat down and placed his hands on the cold surface of the crystal, as the recurring nagging suspicion about the Dragons plagued him yet again. </p>\r\n<p>Could they be deceiving him, he wondered? </p>\r\n<p>Was it possible they had found a way to overcome, at least in part, his sorcery? </p>\r\n<p>Were they playing him for a fool?</p>\r\n<p>''Of course not!'' his pride laughed at the mere thought of such a notion. </p>\r\n<p>Why then, he mused, was he so disturbed? </p>\r\n<p>Why these infuriating flashes, as of a dream he could not remember? He sighed... then laughed aloud. </p>\r\n<p>What did it matter anyway? </p>\r\n<p>Even if they were planning and plotting together, there was nothing they could do. Nothing could be released from the Orbs without his commands. Let them plot. It would not be for much longer. Still, he would be as well to place the guards as soon as possible. Having settled the decision in his mind, he felt relaxed enough to begin.</p>\r\n<p>Summoning Tareb into the Orb, he removed one hand and called forth the various runes he required. Using the power of Tareb, he bound and chained the runes to build a protective wall between this dimension and the gateway to the astral planes, which he was about to open. The room beyond the wall rose and heaved, contorting and fading until it was no more and in its place stretched an endless corridor of nothingness. Into this corridor, Duman summoned the Watchers who had been in the vicinity of Willoway. Swirling mists thickened into semi-solid shapes &mdash; tall, robed figures, featureless faces hidden beneath draping hoods. Eagerly expecting good news, he called the first one forward. He did not like what he heard. He called another. And another. All told the same tale. Duman was incensed. </p>\r\n<p>What good was the destruction of the village if the villagers had escaped? </p>\r\n<p>The death of buildings held no pleasure or victory. As so often happened of late, his anger overrode his sense and he grabbed the hapless Watcher and yanked it through the wall. Immediately it began to smoke, small flames licking along the edge of its robe as it shrivelled, crushed by the pressure of the physical realm that twisted its insubstantial form.</p>\r\n<p>"Rats Master,” it managed to cry before it disappeared completely in a great ''whoosh'' of flame that blazed up his arm. </p>\r\n<p>Had Duman not been himself contorted by rage and the pain of his injudicious action, he might have realised that the Watcher was trying to call his attention, not to the horde of rats that had lead to his defeat at Willoway, but to the two pairs of black, watchful eyes that peered from a tiny crack in the stone in the corner of the room. But all the wizard could think of was that somehow the cursed girl had managed to exert control over the rats even from the great distance between them. </p>\r\n<p>How? </p>\r\n<p>Surely she was not already that strong or that well versed in the wielding? </p>\r\n<p>And what was the strange form of protection that the Watchers spoke of, that they could neither remove nor destroy? </p>\r\n<p>The continuous and unresolved round of questions angered him still further and with reckless speed he closed the gateway and unravelled the wall. </p>\r\n<p>Beneath his hand he could feel the swirling rebellion of the Dragon. He curled his hand tighter, the physical action causing an increase of mental pressure upon the blue essence by his will. His lips curved in an ugly smile and his eyes gleamed with sadistic pleasure as Tareb recoiled, filling the Orb with pain and revulsion. Duman pressed even harder, until the Dragon curled into a tight knot of midnight blue at the very centre of the Orb. With a vicious laugh he squeezed a final time before releasing it. When the Orb was clear once more he ran his hands gently over it, muttering softly.</p>\r\n<p>"You are nothing beside me. Remember that." </p>\r\n<p>He leant forward, placing his eye on the Orb and peering into its depths. </p>\r\n<p>"I shall be watching you." </p>\r\n<p>So softly did he whisper that he did not even realise he had spoken aloud but the sharp ears of the rats had heard his words and one of them scurried off in alarm. </p>\r\n<p>Kretos listened to his brothers'' report in dismay. The Dragons must be warned &mdash; but how? Every room that contained an Orb was warded. To try to enter through the door would be certain death... or worse. It would take much to long to widen the tunnels enough for him squeeze through and anyway, if he did that his secret would definitely be out. But this time he could not simply leave it to his family to send thoughts... and hope. This time he had to make sure the Dragons heard. He had to think... and quickly... before Duman placed the guards he was already on his way to the Casting Room to prepare.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos paced up and down the tunnel, moaning and groaning as every idea turned sour. His brother skittered out of his way as booted feet fell dangerously close to his tail and squeaked that he was worse than a Rujentarg. Kretos stopped, his eyes suddenly bright and he picked up the rat with a wide grin and kissed his twitching nose.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s it,” he cried, slipping his brother into his pocket and running to the holding pens, his mind running ahead, formulating a perilous plan. </p>\r\n<p>"Just hope he doesn''t use a transportation spell," Kretos told the grey rat as he placed him on the floor. The rat squeaked in alarm. It was too dangerous. Kretos shook his head. It was his only chance. </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t worry," Kretos reassured the anxious rat, "he hardly ever uses them anyway and the Orb Room is very close to his Casting Room. I''m sure he wouldn''t waste the energy for so short a distance." </p>\r\n<p>Kretos was far from as confident as he tried to sound but he had little choice. He could think of nothing else. He slid back the bolt on the pen that housed the Rujentarg. It was a tall creature of massive proportions. A huge head covered with spiked horns and filled with rage with a neck as thick as a man’s waist and a body as big and strong as five oxen. Great fists swung on the end of powerful, muscular arms like mighty sledgehammers. Bowed of leg, it nonetheless possessed amazing speed. All in all, an incredible killing machine... with only one flaw, a blind and uncontrollable hatred of fire. Yet for all its awesome fearfulness, as long as its eyes were kept covered the Rujentarg remained as passive as a baby and allowed Kretos to lead it quietly out of its pen and up the stairs to the Orb Room he had chosen. Kretos positioned the Rujentarg carefully in front of the door. It groaned as Kretos moved away and it found itself alone, swinging its head from side to side listening for noises. Kretos took the brand from the wall sconce then, taking a deep breath, nodded to the rat to chew away the lacing that held the mask in place. As the mask fell to the floor there was an instant of silent immobility and then the Rujentarg let out a mighty roar as Kretos thrust the brand in its face and jumped aside.</p>\r\n<p>Just as Kretos had hoped, the creature lunged forward, lashing out and pounding the door to the room straight off its hinges with one blow. The runes retaliated to the unauthorized entry immediately. Searing bolts of energy crackled from the framework. They struck the Rujentarg in sizzling waves that seared through its body, paralysing it, spread-eagled in the doorway, and drained its life force. Taking a deep breath, Kretos crossed his fingers and ducked through the creatures'' legs. He made it unnoticed. Almost breathless with fear and excitement, he grabbed the Orb floating in the centre of the room.</p>\r\n<p>"He''s setting guards in the rooms. Danger. Danger. You just have time to warn the others. No more gathering. Danger. Guards in the rooms," he warned quickly, then sped back out through the Rujentarg’s legs, grabbed the chewed mask and, trusting to a lucky landing, jumped off the edge of the parapet to the lower level. He landed badly, his leg twisting beneath him. Biting his tongue to stop himself from crying out, he dragged himself out of sight and not a moment too soon. The scream of rage from the wizard rivalled that of the Rujentarg.</p>\r\n<p>"Kretos! You useless lump of dried-up bog mud! Get your snivelling hide up here. Now,” screamed Duman, as he rounded the corner and saw the reason for the runic alarm that had screeched through the fortress like the wail of demented a banshee. He disposed of the smoking husk of the Rujentarg with a contemptuous finger and, silencing the warding runes, stepped into the room. The Orb rested innocently on its cushion of air &mdash; the pale pink glow, low and untroubled. Duman reached out. His eyes narrowed beneath his dark brow as he felt the warmth of it. It should not be so. His suspicions rose anew, fuelling his already boiling anger.</p>\r\n<p>"Kreeetooos,” he bellowed.</p>\r\n<p>"D...down h...h...here, Master. I...I...I''m s...sorry, M...master. It had j...j...just burst out. I t...t...tried to s...stop it b...but... " Kretos dragged himself painfully into view. He hardly dared look up at the wizard, for he knew by the tone of the summoning scream that Duman suspected this was his work. But as he ventured a quick glance, he noticed Duman’s puzzled and doubtful gaze and gave silent thanks for the bad landing that had resulted in the broken leg and bruised face that gave more credence to his story than any amount of cringing or wheedling. Deciding to use it to its fullest, he rolled his eyes into his head and dropped it to the floor.</p>\r\n<p>Duman levitated to the lower level and knelt down beside the prone figure. If it had been a clean break he might have suspected Kretos had inflicted it himself but the leg was not merely broken, it was shattered. The snivelling coward would not have the courage to inflict such an injury on himself nor the intelligence to think up such a daring plan. Duman laughed at himself for entertaining the notion. No, it was nothing but an accident. The sight of the snapped laces of the mask that dangled in Kreto’s limp hand, confirmed his re-assessment of events. </p>\r\n<p>"I ought to leave you to suffer," he muttered unsympathetically, straightening Kreto’s leg and uttering a quick healing spell. "But I have things I need fetching." </p>\r\n<p>He slapped Kretos until he woke, dragged him to his feet and promptly backhanded him to the floor again with a dire warning for the consequences if such a thing should happen again. Kretos nodded and was able to assure him confidently that it would never happen again. </p>\r\n<p>"See that it doesn''t. Now, fetch me five of something small and docile. I don''t care what. And be quick, you''ve already wasted too much of my time," Duman flung over his shoulder as he rounded the corner back to his Casting Room. Kretos hid his gleeful smirk. He recognised the slight tilt to the head, the dip of one shoulder and the unconscious tic in the wrist that caused the wizard’s fingers to snap against the soft material of his robe. </p>\r\n<p>''So? All''s not well in the Masters'' garden,'' he whispered silently to himself, his heart brimming with pleasure that he might have just added to the wizard’s frustrations. </p>\r\n<p>He hummed softly as he returned to the pens to choose the unfortunate victims, toying with the idea of picking the most stupid and unsuitable, if only to waste a little more of Duman’s time with ranting and raving and endless journeys back and forth. But then, deciding that it was wisest not to press his luck, he picked five that were exactly what the wizard was looking for. Again he changed his mind and replaced one with another slightly less than ideal. If he was too helpful it may just set Duman thinking again. As it was, this one cost Kretos a sliced earlobe and a bucketful of humiliation but he figured his safety was well worth it. </p>\r\n<p>Back in the tunnels he relaxed beneath the loving attention of his family and recalled the way the Orb had flared a brilliant red beneath his hands. He smiled, certain that the Dragon had heard and understood his warning. He felt pleased with himself. Though he had for years played his dangerous game of deceit with the wizard, this was only the second time he had actually acted against him in outright rebellion. The first being his daring rescue of the two-legs... Velkaan. It felt good and bolstered his courage and determination, as well as his belief that the wizard could indeed be defeated. If a lowly creature as he could succeed, albeit only in small actions, then surely such as Dragons must eventually overcome.</p>\r\n<p>Down in the Casting Room, Duman raced through the spells that would turn the quivering, frightened subjects strapped upon the table into mindless, obedient eyes and ears for his information, to ensure that Kreto’s hopes did not come to pass. They were mundane spells &mdash; simple but effective and with little to no risk towards himself. Even as he was casting, half his mind was elsewhere, impatient and wondering as to whether the Sectus had yet located the Shadow. His guards ready, he transported them to their stations, having revised the warding runes to accept their presence as though it were his own. He returned to his tower room and lay upon his sleeping couch. He did not sleep but lay meditating, until at last he felt the movement of energies that told him his spell had been activated. A triumphant cry fell from his lips. His Shadow was once more on the move!</p>\r\n<p>In their various rooms about the fortress, the Dragons chafed against their enforced return to isolation. Soleb had managed to contact his brothers one last time to pass on Kreto’s warning before Duman had appeared with the guards. Now each rested inside their Orbs. They had come full circle: separated and alone once more, as they had been in the beginning. Waiting in ignorant solitude while others decided their fate. But this time it was worse. Knowing that each was only a thought away and yet unable to come together for support and strength &mdash; unable to seek companionship or counsel. </p>\r\n<p>One of the Orbs pulsed sickly. It was Felnath. Struggling against a bitter anger and despair with frustrated helplessness, the essence within the Orb fluctuated between palest lime and a deep ivy, that darkened and transcended the colours of the spectrum into an unrecognisable shade no normal eye could comprehend. He knew the eyes in the room stored every detail. But he could not control his emotions. It was his nature to be free and wild and the crystal walls of his prison choked him. For a while he had began to hope. Now that hope had been taken away and he was lost. He did not know how long he could contain himself without his brothers'' wisdom and sense of calm. He willed himself inwards, recoiling into a dark ball at the Orb’s centre. </p>\r\n<p>His brothers too, waited. They too, knew a renewed sense of frustration and helplessness. They too, shared Felnaths'' anxiety. Power of the Wind, he suffered the most from this incarceration. But even as they pitied him, he filled them with unease. He had grown increasingly volatile since events had begun to unfold and without them to guide and control him. </p>\r\n<p>He could explode at any moment!</p>\r\n<p>Each hoped fervently that Duman would not summon Felnath again... for the consequences of such a summoning could be the undoing of them all.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 23, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

As the major port in Rohansuk, it was always busy but these past few days it had become positively chaotic. The harbourmaster looked out of his window and groaned. He had a backlog of ships waiting to be unloaded or loaded. Short tempered Captains becoming increasingly nervous at the sight of the Gahyashi (Soyex Raider) riding at anchor just offshore, like a bird of prey eyeing up its next meal. The docks were a jam-packed jungle of crates, bales, sacks, livestock and unclaimed baggage seething with impatient and disgruntled passengers and their companions. The market place had continued to grow, despite his constant efforts to remove those tradesmen who persisted in setting up their stalls without permits, and congested the thoroughfare while they held lengthy bartering with travellers, merchants and harbour folk. <p></p>\r\n<p>He had lost count of the number of pickpockets and thieves that had been dragged to his door. He had neither the space nor patience to deal with them, hence the ever-open window and the obligatory paperwork conveniently located in a drawer on the opposite wall. </p>\r\n<p>Was it his fault if the miscreants kept escaping while his back was turned? </p>\r\n<p>Above the babbling chatter of the crowds the noise from the overflowing inns spilled out into the harbour, as did the inevitable fights that were the predictable outcome of the pleasurable pursuits of drunken sailors who had been at sea for months on end. Fights he was sure were instigated in many a case by the growing group of agitators that were stirring up the less fortunate of the ports'' society, against the law and order of the realm, with talk of coming deliverance. From what and by who, he was not interested enough to ask.</p>\r\n<p>The watchtower bell heralded the arrival of yet another problem. The burning pain in his stomach intensified as he forced his way through the crowd to the tower. Sweat dripped from his brow and he was wheezing alarmingly by the time he had climbed to the top.</p>\r\n<p>"You all right Olben?" asked the lookout, gazing anxiously at the white-faced and shaking harbourmaster walking stiffly across the room to drop into the nearest chair.</p>\r\n<p>"Who is it and what do they want?" snapped Olben curling his fists against the pain that had now travelled up into his chest.</p>\r\n<p>"Tallship... out of Katatuk."</p>\r\n<p>"Tell the Captain he''ll have to wait." </p>\r\n<p>Olben closed his eyes and listened to the flicking of the signal light. His head was throbbing and he waited with dread for the coming argument. Instead he heard the chink of glass on glass.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s okay. He''s no cargo this time &mdash; just few passengers. I''ve told him to just send them ashore."</p>\r\n<p>Olben opened his eyes and tried to push himself to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"They can''t just arrive without paperwork,” he snapped irritably.</p>\r\n<p>"Paperwork be blowed! Who''s going to notice eight more in that mob? You''re going to drink this and then get some rest. The only thing going on down there at the moment is another fight. Let the innkeeper sort it out... he''s the one that got them in that state. I haven''t seen you for the next two hours. Sleep." </p>\r\n<p>With that, the lookout threw a blanket over the exhausted man and shut the door. A little while later he waved to Davin as the longboat passed beneath the tower and called down that they were cleared to land. Having had very little to do with ports and their procedures, Davin saw nothing unusual in this, while Burtak (who’s greater experience knew better) was not inclined to put him straight. With their eyes open for trouble and their hands firmly on their valuables, Davin, Tynan and the dwarves elbowed their way through the jostling crowds. As they neared the market, the crowds grew thicker. Davin’s spine began to tingle and his eyes darted back and forth amongst the sea of faces. He was sure he noticed the same ones popping up again and again. His fingers curled tighter about the hilt of his sword.</p>\r\n<p>"I counted six. What about you?" whispered Tynan without turning his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Seven. Four to the left... three to the right," he replied. "Let''s get out of this mob. We''re sitting ducks here and I don''t want any innocent people getting hurt."</p>\r\n<p>Tynan pulled the bow off his shoulder and held it out in front of him.</p>\r\n<p>"Move aside there," he shouted in a commanding tone. "Kings'' business. Move aside and let us through."</p>\r\n<p>"I was hoping to be a little less public," sighed Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"Tynan has the right idea," Veskai disagreed. "Whoever these men are, they know we''re here. The quicker we get to where we can defend ourselves the better. Public or not," and so saying he strode in front of the two knights, his spear moving the more belligerent and obstinate a lot faster than the blunted tip of Tynan’s bow.</p>\r\n<p>Once free of the crowd they walked a little ways and then slipped down a side street. Davin and Tynan took up places in the middle of the street while the dwarves split into two groups either side. They did not have to wait long. A mob of rough looking individuals came running around the corner after them. But they were not those they had espied amongst the crowd. These were unshaven and dirty, with long, unkempt hair and clothes whose patches had patches. They were the dregs of harbour society. It was plain... in their manner and in their eyes: murderous, ruthless and vicious. Armed with swords, clubs, chains and knives, the group of about twenty strutted up the alley.</p>\r\n<p>"Stand and state your business,” ordered Davin. </p>\r\n<p>"By Borgens'' Crown,” snorted Veskai, swinging his axe into position. "Isn''t that obvious?"</p>\r\n<p>Davin shot him an angry glance. Unwholesome and unfriendly as they might be, these were still people of Rohansuk. People he had sworn to defend and protect and he was loath to kill them unless he absolutely had to. Veskai shrugged.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re our bus''ness, Knight,” spat the leader. "You an'' those like you. You as keeps us ''ere in the dirt while you an'' yourn live the good life. The Master ''as promised us better''n you can, if we fight for ''im. So defend yourselves... cos we aim to fight!"</p>\r\n<p>"Oh dear," murmured Tynan and loosed his arrow. </p>\r\n<p>The first half dozen went down under the knights'' arrows then the dwarves stepped into the fray and finished of the remainder. It was a short fight, if it could be called such at all. The rebels had been way out of their depth, yet Davin felt a twinge of anxiety over the fact that they had stood their ground. He had fully expected them to turn and flee, for such as these were not known for their courage once the odds had been turned against them. They were usually ambushers and muggers. What had gotten into them to change their behaviour so radically? </p>\r\n<p>More than just the words of a promise of a better life &mdash; of that he was certain.</p>\r\n<p>The sound of running footsteps brought his gaze up, away from the lifeless bodies at his feet, to another group of men bursting around the corner. They stopped as they saw Davin and his company with their weapons raised in their direction.</p>\r\n<p>"Davin?" Called the man at the head of the group. </p>\r\n<p>It was the seven Davin had spied at the harbour. He glared at them suspiciously but to his amazement, the dwarves immediately lowered their weapons and strode forward to meet them. The two groups eyed each other for a moment, and then the strangers'' tanned face creased into a grin that started upon his wide lips and spread up to light his deep brown eyes. He was still smiling as he strode over to Davin. Though he appeared much shorter, Davin got the impression that he did not really have look down to meet the Man’s gaze and the large hand the man offered from beneath the wide sleeve of his loosely flowing robe, felt surprisingly lost within Davin’s grasp. The feeling unsettled him and he found himself frowning instead of returning the friendly greeting.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s me, Eiyaris!" </p>\r\n<p>Davin had no idea who the man was but as an experienced soldier he knew the meaning of the darting eyes and the scratch of the earlobe.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, I''ll be! I didn''t recognise you,” he exclaimed loudly, for anyone who might be listening uninvited. "Let''s go get a drink and you can tell me what you''ve been up to all this time." </p>\r\n<p>He slapped the elf on the back like an old friend and the two groups mingled together and wandered off to the inn where the Elfin had retained rooms. Once in the privacy of his room, Eiyaris introduced himself properly as a Ph''nyr in the Elven Elite, dropped his cloak and shook hands with Davin and Tynan before turning to the dwarves.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s been a long time cousins," he held out his hands palms up.</p>\r\n<p>"Too long," agreed Burtak, with a respectful bow of his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Still sneaking about in disguises, I see. Some things never change," observed Veskai but his tone was light and full of humour and Eiyaris responded with a musical laugh.</p>\r\n<p>"The Elders have instructed me to convey their respects to our cousins, the Dwarves and say that it is an honour to be fighting at their side once more." Eiyaris bowed. </p>\r\n<p>"Likewise. It''ll be interesting to see which of us has grown soft over the years," returned Veskai, holding out his arm. The two warriors held elbows and grinned at each other.</p>\r\n<p>"Actually," Davin interrupted them as he spread a map across the table. "You won''t be. Fighting side by side, that is."</p>\r\n<p>Dwarf and elf looked at him quizzically.</p>\r\n<p>"I did some thinking on the voyage and I''ve come to a few conclusions that have forced me to make some decisions... in the absence of higher authority." </p>\r\n<p>He waited for the group to gather around the table. </p>\r\n<p>"Time... Gentlemen. That''s our biggest enemy at the moment. I still have to go to both S''yumêrra and Fellamund. The armies of the Dwarves and Elfin have still to travel to Symtar to receive their orders. Study the map and do the maths. If that little episode earlier is anything to go by, we don’t have the time to go about things in such a long-winded manner."</p>\r\n<p>"There may be less time than you think." Eiyaris stepped into the pause. "There''s been much rabble-rousing and discontent here. It''s rumoured that Duman’s minions are already making forays deep into Rohansuk. Your King, for some reason, is biding his time in mobilizing the Knights."</p>\r\n<p>"What''s the matter with the man?" exclaimed Tynan in disgust. "And what are the Regents doing? Roaban must surely have spoken to them by now."</p>\r\n<p>"You know what the King''s like," replied Davin in a quiet voice, trying to calm his friend who was now pacing angrily about the room.</p>\r\n<p>"Too busy smoothing the wrinkles out of his blouson," sneered Tynan, adding as he spun around and grabbed the wine bottle off the dresser, "but I would expect better from the Regents... "</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure they''re doing their best in trying circumstances," sighed Davin as he gazed at Tynan’s flushed face and the shooting sparks in his eyes. His friend did not often get ''a bee in his bonnet'', as the saying went, but when he did...&nbsp;He caught Burtak’s eye and nodded toward the wine bottle, indicating the he should take it away before Tynan imbibed too much. Misinterpreting the gesture (he should have known better than to ask a dwarf!) Burtak quickly rushed off for a couple more bottles. </p>\r\n<p>"... But that''s not our problem," Davin returned to the business at hand and tapped the map. "This is."</p>\r\n<p>"What do you propose?" Asked Veskai.</p>\r\n<p>"Eiyaris, have the main body of the Elite already left Phelise for Symtar?" Davin looked across the table at the elf.</p>\r\n<p>"They were to leave within the week. They should be well on their way by now," Eiyaris nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"Good. What I propose, is that the dwarves do not follow but go directly here... to Talgheer."</p>\r\n<p>"I see your thinking." Veskai turned a respectful gaze upon Davin. "Undoubtedly Duman will attempt to take it. He''ll have control of the river and a firm base with access into S''yumêrra. With strongholds there and at Symtar, he could push any resisting forces into a trap between his two armies."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure about this, Davin? The King might not take too kindly to your deploying his armies for him," Tynan cautioned him.</p>\r\n<p>"Exactly," Davin replied first to Veskai, then leaned back in his chair to look at Tynan. "We don''t have time to run willy-nilly all over the country waiting for someone to give an order."</p>\r\n<p>"I know that and I agree with you. I''m just asking if you''re sure you know what you might be letting yourself in for?" repeated Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"If we get through this war alive then the King can try me for treason if he wants."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s not the trial that worries me... it''s getting my neck stretched at the end of it,” quipped Tynan, pouring himself another glass of wine from the fresh bottles Burtak had just arrived with.</p>\r\n<p>"With respect," Veskai glanced from Tynan to Davin. "The Dwarves are the Kings allies, not his army to command. The place we chose to fight is our decision and we will follow whatever judgment we deem to be the most wise. As a member of the Dwarvish Conclave, I extend the offer of sanctuary in Katatuk should you, because of this, find yourselves in need of it." </p>\r\n<p>"I feel I may speak for the Elders and say that you will also be most welcome in Phelise," Eiyaris added solemnly.</p>\r\n<p>"Many thanks. To you both," Davin smiled gratefully. "But I''m hoping it won''t come to that."</p>\r\n<p>"Still, we''ll keep it in mind... just in case," Tynan lifted his glass in a toast to elf and dwarf. Davin rolled his eyes in resignation. Tynan grinned and emptied his glass.</p>\r\n<p>"You never know," he muttered, re-filling his glass.</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s get back to business," said Davin. "My second proposal is this. We split into two groups. Tynan. You, Eiyaris and Veskai, with two more, shall go to Fellamund. I''ll take Sirrak and... ?" He looked questioningly at Eiyaris.</p>\r\n<p>"Irrisal, you will go with Davin," Eiyaris turned to the elf next to him, who nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll take Sirrak and Irrisal and go to S''yumêrra. Burtak, if you would remain here and instruct your people to go to Talgheer?"</p>\r\n<p>"Now hang on,” exclaimed Tynan, suddenly all attention. "You''re the one that''s supposed to do the persuading. I''m just here to lend support. Remember?" he argued. </p>\r\n<p>"Change of plans," smirked Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"But... "</p>\r\n<p>"Non-negotiable. Don''t worry, you''ll do fine. Fellamund is so close to Symtar that the Fellis are already probably well aware of what''s going on. You shouldn''t have much trouble convincing them that they''re next."</p>\r\n<p>"You think?" replied Tynan facetiously.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan and his company rode along the coastline as far as Brookes Head and then headed northeast for Fellamund. Evidence of the troubles in the land grew. It was with mixed emotions that he noted the mass of refugees spilling west, heading, they informed him, for the nearest barrack towns and the militia being trained there. As they crossed the border into Felamund they discovered the Fellis were already experiencing first hand what was happening. Villages and homesteads were being attacked and burned by mysterious assailants that left nothing in their wake to identify them. Fear, suspicion and unfriendliness met them everywhere. The inns they frequented were full of muttering men folk, with white faces and nervously darting eyes, who kept their women and children safely locked away behind bolted doors. The dwarves concealed themselves as much as possible beneath their cloaks of cloth whilst the elfin remained cloaked in their illusions and passed by unnoticed. When they arrived at Marjasi, the Kings Palace, and revealed their identities, they were given immediate audience and rushed to the Kings'' side. </p>\r\n<p>The Fellis were a race of merchants and traders. They had an army of sorts but they were not known for their battle skills. Their generals were negotiators of contracts, business deals and trade-offs, more than soldiers. Generals of money rather than men, since the Fellis believed there was no argument that could not be solved if the price was right. So it was, that they had no idea how to proceed in their predicament. The court was in uproar and the King, beside himself with confusion. He had sent an envoy to his cousin in Symtar but they had never returned. Thus his greeting of Tynan and his companions was embarrassingly effusive as he hugged them and wept into his silk handkerchief. They could have anything their hearts desired if they would only tell him what to do! </p>\r\n<p>Tynan sighed, closing his eyes so that the man would not see the disgust he felt. That such an effeminate and incompetent creature should be King, though he had to admit he could see the family resemblance. Thank the Mother for the Regents of the Orders!</p>\r\n<p>The Elite stared down at the wailing King with haughty disdain and an obvious lack of respect, which they politely but ineffectively attempted to conceal by murmuring their sympathies for the Kings terrible situation. </p>\r\n<p>''Time has not dealt honourably with the Fellis,'' Eiyaris mused silently, as he gazed sadly at the bloated face and watering eyes of the man whose crown had slipped askew and compared him to the proud warriors of legend that were depicted in the stories of old. </p>\r\n<p>The dwarves merely turned away. Rebuffing all the Kings overtures of friendship and pleas for assistance with a stony silence of undisguised distaste and revulsion.</p>\r\n<p>The King turned his efforts back to Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Please," he pleaded, grabbing the front of Tynan’s shirt. "Tell me what to do."</p>\r\n<p>Tynan pried himself loose.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps you should sit down," he advised not unkindly, and then he proceeded to inform the distraught man that things were going to get much worse. That what his realm was experiencing was but the tip of the iceberg. That at present, Duman was concentrating his main force upon Rohansuk but that eventually he would swarm across Fellamund like a plague.</p>\r\n<p>"Sire," one of the generals stepped forward confidently. "Now that we know the identity of our antagonist we can open negotiations. Let me go to him. I''m sure I can reach some compromise that will be acceptable to both parties. A payment of recompense or a trade agreement?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes! Yes,” cried the King jumping to his feet full of optimism, only to be cut down by Veskais'' derisive sneer.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, he''ll agree a trade alright. Your lives in exchange for... nothing!"</p>\r\n<p>The King slumped back into his seat with an ear-piercing wail.</p>\r\n<p>"Well... thank you!" Tynan glared at Veskai as, once again, he tried to calm the King back into some semblance of sanity. </p>\r\n<p>"Now then," Tynan began instructing him. "You will muster your army... "</p>\r\n<p>"Such as it is," Veskai cut in, Tynan ignored the dwarf, "and every able-bodied man in Fellamund. You will also gather every weapon and all provisions that can be spared and send them all to the border where you will wait for further instructions."</p>\r\n<p>"But what about the raids and killings that are happening here?" Asked one of the generals.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan chewed his lower lip. That was a good question. He beckoned his group over to the far side of the room, out of earshot of the waiting Fellis, to discuss it privately.</p>\r\n<p>"My companions here have agreed to a solution," he said on returning to the Kings'' side.</p>\r\n<p>"Some of them are willing to stay here. They will each select a group of your best men and lead them against these unknown raiders until official orders are forthcoming."</p>\r\n<p>"How much?" asked the general. Tynan stared at him non-plussed. </p>\r\n<p>"For their services... how much?" he repeated.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing," answered Tynan, amazed that the man had even asked.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t have that. Unclosed contracts and all, you know," insisted the general.</p>\r\n<p>"But this is war man,” exclaimed Tynan. "We all help each other." Tynan looked to the King, who merely waved a limp hand back in the general’s direction. Tynan threw up his hands. "By the Mother! Let me try and explain this to you," he began, taking a deep breath. "There is a war going on. We need each. Without... " </p>\r\n<p>"Tacha’s Beard! We''ll be here forever,” muttered Veskai, pushing Tynan out of the way as the Fellis general shook his head and crossed his arms stubbornly across his chest. "Four Darlwood trees!"</p>\r\n<p>"One," haggled the general, instantly coming alive.</p>\r\n<p>"Two."</p>\r\n<p>"Done,” cried the general with an eager grin.</p>\r\n<p>"... Annually for twenty-five years," Veskai finished smugly.</p>\r\n<p>The general glared at Veskai in dismay, while his fellow negotiators tittered behind his back, but he had already... ''Done the Deal''... and so, reluctantly, pulled the necessary parchment from beneath his robe. He scribbled, signed and handed the scroll to Veskai, who took it with a gleam in his eye as he turned to Eiyaris.</p>\r\n<p>"What about you?"</p>\r\n<p>The general gasped, gaping at the dwarf in horror, his red face draining to a pasty white.</p>\r\n<p>"Fair''s fair! Can''t pay one and not the other," Veskai tapped the general on the shoulder with his scroll.</p>\r\n<p>"If I must choose," said Eiyaris thoughtfully, "then I think... One sack of assorted seeds and one hundred assorted saplings. When this is all over, it is our intention to restore Iåñya M''ath," he explained as the others stared at him quizzically.</p>\r\n<p>"Done,” cried the general and handed him his contract before anything else could be added. The King straightened his crown and pushed himself to his feet, addressing his court in such a manner as to suggest that he had been in command of the proceedings throughout.</p>\r\n<p>"Now that everything is sorted out, I feel it is only my duty to consider the safety of the Queen," he announced in a high, nasal tone. "While it grieves me to have to leave you brave men to face the enemy alone, I must needs do the honourable thing and take her east, to the safety of Puramena. I shall of course return as soon as I can." </p>\r\n<p>Before anyone could reply, he had left the room.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan gazed at the empty doorway in disgust. Puramena Palace stood on the coast of the Pahaqua Sea. Tynan had no illusions that the King would actually be back. Even this, he surmised, would not be far enough and envisioned the King taking to sea... hopefully never to be seen again!</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s get out of here," he said aloud.</p>\r\n<p>While Tynan and Veskai were drowning their disgust in the Kings'' wine cellar prior to starting back out for home, Davin, Sirrak and Irrisal were entering Uthcor, the coastal township where the Table of Captains of S''yumêrra sat. It was not a government as such, but it was the closest thing resembling one that the Soyex possessed. It ruled by the Law of the Sea and the Strongest. And it worked well, since the majority of the population were seafarers. Few people lived in the interior of S''yumêrra. Mostly the old, those who had been injured and were unfit for ship life, the weak, that had been ousted from power and position, and the Xaushoi, the Soyex holy men. All of these led a nomadic existence, moving their families and herds according to weather, hunting and grazing. For S''yumêrra was a land of extremes: arid and sizzling in summer, sodden and frozen in winter. The raising of crops was virtually impossible in such conditions and so the people drifted with the weather in wide circles from north to south. (It was these people... eons ago... who, having decided that since they were forced to endure such a way of life they might as well see the world, had put wheels to their tents and given birth to the gipsies of today) Apart from the Xaushoi, the people of the interior had no power within the country and so it was that Davin had turned south and headed for Uthcor.</p>\r\n<p>When not aboard ship, the Soyex dwelt in settlements such as Uthcor, dotted along the entire length of the wide, white-sanded beaches that stretched along two-thirds of the coastline and was stopped only by the backs of the Anatol Mountains in the southeast and the great, glacial rise of Jhai Nahv in the north, where only the mighty white bear prowled and padded the ice flows that froze the sea for most of the year. Arriving at Uthcor, they found a Gahyashi fleet of about twenty or so ships already at anchor in the waters around the township. Davin turned to the others with a grin.</p>\r\n<p>"This is a bit of luck," he pointed to the black and red flags fluttering in the wind. "We might have waited days for the necessary Captains to be contacted and arrive."</p>\r\n<p>There was a single building on the edge of the sands where the local Xaushoi resided; every settlement had at least one; and they were agreed permission to leave their horses there since there was no stabling available in Uthcor itself. Once the horses were settled, the group made their way across the wide beach and down the long, straight, platform township where a large crowd had gathered outside the last building, the Table Hall. Pushing their way through to the front, Davin requested permission from the guard on the door to enter, telling him that he had important business he needed to discuss with the Captains. The guard told him to wait and went inside, closing the doors behind him. Davin smiled politely at the curious stares of the Soyex, clenching his jaws to stop the impatient grinding of his teeth at the lengthening delay. Where had the man got to? At last he heard footsteps and turned eagerly as the door opened. His hope died the minute he saw the guards'' face and the drawn sword that he held loosely, but purposely, at his side.</p>\r\n<p>"The Captains have been informed of your request and have declined any interest in speaking with you. They are at present engaged in important Soyex business to which they feel you can have nothing of interest or quality to submit."</p>\r\n<p>Davin stared at the man in disbelief, then his lips turned white and his narrowed eyes blazed with anger. </p>\r\n<p>"Please inform the Captains," he said, quietly and deliberately through gritted teeth, "that I am a Knight of the Dragon. I am here in the company of an envoy of Elfin and Dwarves. What we wish to discuss with them is of much greater importance than which town or ship they are deciding to pull one of their silly little raids on. And, that the quality of my submission was enough to bring my friends here from their homelands. So if the Captains would be so kind as to spare us just a moment of their valuable time, we would be most appreciative!" </p>\r\n<p>Davin’s unveiled sarcasm washed harmlessly over the guard, who was too wrapped up in his indecision to notice it. No one had ever questioned the word of the Captains before and he had no idea what to do about it. </p>\r\n<p>Should he go back in and say the knight was all but demanding entrance? </p>\r\n<p>He might well find himself hanging from the yardarm! </p>\r\n<p>Drawing his lips together, he averted his eyes to a point somewhere just over Davin’s shoulder and stared into the distance.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps if he just ignored him, the man would go away and leave him alone? </p>\r\n<p>Davin was not inclined to be so agreeable. Instead of leaving he stepped closer, so close their faces were almost touching and fixed the guard with a steely glare. </p>\r\n<p>"Well? Why are you still here? Move!"</p>\r\n<p>The guards'' eyes flickered for a moment but he remained where he was. Davin could not help but admire him for refusing to be intimidated and standing his ground however, it was not going to aid Davin’s cause to be kept standing out here like some inconsequential squire. Somehow he had to get inside. Once there the Captains would have to listen. He had tried it the polite way and though he was reluctant to pick a fight with the man, he could think of nothing else. Besides it had worked with the Dwarves. </p>\r\n<p>''Tried and tested''... as Tynan would say. </p>\r\n<p>So, taking a step or two backwards, Davin notched an arrow and aimed it at the guards'' chest.</p>\r\n<p>"I strongly suggest that you stand aside," he advised the amazed guard. "I will ensure that you are not blamed in any way." </p>\r\n<p>"Sir Davin, do you think this is wise?" Irrisal whispered close to his ear as the muttering crowd began to close in.</p>\r\n<p>"If you have another idea, feel free to let me in on it," Davin snapped sharply.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll have to kill me to get passed," the guard told him raising his sword, though he knew it useless against the knights'' arrow. "But I should warn you that there are others inside.</p>\r\n<p>You will be dead before you get three paces."</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll take my chances," answered Davin and drew back on his bow. </p>\r\n<p>The guard went white but still he would not give way. Davin bit his tongue in frustration. The noise from the crowd rose alarmingly. Many of them had already drawn their own weapon and waited only for the word from the guard. </p>\r\n<p>"Sir Davin, please. This will solve nothing," insisted Irrisal.</p>\r\n<p>"By the Forge, use your head,” Sirrak added his counsel to the elfs''. "They''re already signalling the ships."</p>\r\n<p>"We must see the Captains," insisted Davin, neither gaze nor aim wavering. </p>\r\n<p>"Agreed. But we''re not going to get in this way," answered Irrisal.</p>\r\n<p>"Your friend is correct," said the woman as she stepped between the guard and his arrow. </p>\r\n<p>"Are you mad woman?" exclaimed Davin, quickly lowering it harmlessly towards the ground. "Or is it simply a death wish that drives you?"</p>\r\n<p>"If it is, then I''m in the right company," she retorted challengingly.</p>\r\n<p>The corner of Davin’s mouth twitched, her courage and humour dispersing his anger and defusing the volatile situation, he had caused to get out of control, with little loss of face to himself. He stored his arrow back in his quiver and held out his hand gratefully, to sighs of relief from his companions.</p>\r\n<p>"Sir Davin, Knight... " </p>\r\n<p>"I heard," she cut him short. "My name is Saroya. The Captains won''t see you... especially now but I''ll take you to someone they will talk to. For a price."</p>\r\n<p>For some reason her mercenary attitude disappointed him.</p>\r\n<p>"How much?" he asked curtly. </p>\r\n<p>His companions stared at him, surprised at his sudden, impolite manner toward the woman who had probably just saved all their lives. Their surprise was no greater than his own. Why he should expect better of a person he had never met he could not fathom. He just did. The look she returned told him she was well aware of his opinion... and was uncaring of it.</p>\r\n<p>"Not here," she replied, glancing pointedly at the staring crowd and began walking away. </p>\r\n<p>They followed her to a small, run-down hut on the very edge of the settlement. The skins about the walls were hard and cracked, the roof was rotten and the inside was sparse and poor. Just a single mattress, a table, a chair and a candle, was all that could be seen through the open doorway. Davin entered alone, Sirrak and Irrisal making polite and plausible excuses to be elsewhere as Saroya offered them what meagre hospitality she had. She was not fooled but said nothing, merely casting them a grateful look as they left. </p>\r\n<p>Davin watched her as she poured some water into two mugs. Beneath the old, well patched but clean clothes, she was pitifully thin. Skinny in fact, to the point where her bones pushed through the taut skin stretched over them. Her hands, arms and the sharp-angles of her face were richly tanned by sun and wind but under the golden glow lay an unhealthy pallor, accentuating the darkness of eyes ringed by lines of bitterness and sorrow. His heart went out her. He could not blame her for taking the opportunity of making a little money. With a warm smile he began to apologise for his earlier behaviour but she rounded on him fiercely. </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t bother yourself. My price is not your good opinion. Neither is it your friendship or your pity. I have no use for any of them. I''ll tell you my story and offer you my proposition. All I require from you is an answer."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m listening," he made himself comfortable on the floor. </p>\r\n<p>"My mother was a hard, stubborn and bigoted old woman," she told him in bitter tones as she handed him his drink. "When my brother brought home a wife that was not Soyex, she ostracized them. We were a powerful family in those days and so the rest of the settlement had no choice but follow her dictates. Finally, miserable and weary with living on the faint hope my mother might change her mind. He took his family back to Rohansuk. Many years later a young boy came to us. My brother, his wife and the rest of their children had been brutally murdered and he had sought out the only family he knew. But my mother was unforgiving and relentless in her anger toward my brother and returned her judgement against his son also. I begged and begged her to reconsider, to accept him, but she wouldn''t, and cast him out. In my own anger and grief, for I had loved my brother more than life itself, I made the fatal mistake of challenging her decision, arguing constantly... and without sense. As punishment she married me to one of the neighbouring Captains, a man whose ways were set in the same, traditional moral values. She made certain to tell him of my waywardness, suggesting a strong hand would not come amiss. My husband was more than pleased to oblige her." She was forced to stop as her voice broke upon the memories.</p>\r\n<p>Davin was stunned by the sudden and uncontrollable rage that filled him now that his curiosity about the two missing fingers on her left hand, the broken slant of her nose and the scar that ran down the side of her neck, was shockingly satisfied. He had never wanted anything more than he wanted to get his hands on the brute of a husband that had committed such monstrosities against her; except perhaps to wrap his arms about her and never let anyone hurt her ever again. The thought shocked him even more than her story and he had no desire to go where that thought was leading him. </p>\r\n<p>"Your... husband. Where is he now?" he asked quickly. </p>\r\n<p>"Dead. Six months ago. His Gahyashi went down in a storm during a raid on one of the lesser Captains along Jhai Nahv. My mother is also gone. Now I am alone and free. Free to think and choose for myself. That is my story. This then, is my price... I want to find Velkaan, my brothers'' son. What is your answer?"</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t promise anything," he answered honestly. "We''re on the verge of war Saroya. A war that none us may come through alive. But, if we do, then I''ll try. You have my word." </p>\r\n<p>She gazed at him thoughtfully for a long while before holding out her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Then tomorrow I will take you to Winaka."</p>\r\n<p>She came the following afternoon as promised and led him down the beach to where a small tent had been pitched. Inside sat an old man. Grey hair was twisted into a knot on the top of his head, except for the mandatory braids worn by all Soyex males, and he wore only a loincloth and the talon of an eagle fastened to a leather thong about his neck. Pale blue eyes flicked over the eagles feather on Davin’s bow, before regarding the knight without expression from within a leathery face, etched deep with countless lines and resembling a piece of poorly mended pottery. Silently, Winaka motioned Davin to be seated.</p>\r\n<p>Davin took his place on the hot sand, warmed by the fire crackling in the pit that had been dug in the centre of the tent. He started to speak but the cool gaze of Winaka warned him to hold his tongue. The silence droned on, a hundred times worse than Rhodka’s endless monologue. Davin forced himself to sit still, to refrain from fidgeting against the heat that was becoming almost unbearable and burning his lungs until he could barely draw breath. The Dragonmark gleamed in the flames as he pulled off his shirt and used it to wipe the sweat that continued to stream down his face and sting his eyes. He closed them as Winaka threw yet more wood upon the fire and so missed the faint smile that at last twitched the corners of the Xaushoi’s lips. He also missed the pale-yellow powder that followed but not the smell, or the gagging smoke that tore his throat and sent him into a panicked fit of uncontrollable coughing. His head grew thick and fuzzy. His thoughts became confused and incoherent. Sick and dizzy, he felt as though he were being ripped apart, his mind somehow being wrenched from his body that pulled on him like a heavy weight, like... </p>\r\n<p>"An anchor." </p>\r\n<p>He heard the voice as from far away. He opened his eyes onto Winaka’s face. It was blurred but he was sure the lips were not moving. </p>\r\n<p>Who then? </p>\r\n<p>He tried to turn his head, to see who else was in the tent, but his body seemed to have turned to stone.</p>\r\n<p>"It will be less unpleasant for us both if you stop resisting," said the voice again. </p>\r\n<p>"Who are you?" shouted Davin. "Why are you hiding?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not. You are. Who am I? Why, I''m you!"</p>\r\n<p>Davin suddenly felt himself rise up and leave his body in a joyous leap of freedom. Huge antlers cutting the air as he swung his proud head toward the red fox sitting and staring expectantly skyward.</p>\r\n<p>"Is someone else coming?" asked the stag. </p>\r\n<p>The fox started in surprise, spinning on his haunches to face him. For some reason this pleased the stag enormously and he grinned.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re not what I expected," said the fox in a puzzled tone, casting a quick glance back upwards.</p>\r\n<p>"I am what I am," replied the stag.</p>\r\n<p>"As are we all," agreed the fox. "Let''s talk."</p>\r\n<p>Then, to Davin’s great annoyance, everything went black.</p>\r\n<p>Awareness responded to the touch of a gentle hand and a cool cloth across his brow. His eyelids fluttered open and he winced under the sharp pain that stabbed through his head.</p>\r\n<p>"What happened?" he croaked weakly.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t try to talk," advised Saroya. "You''ve been in the spirit world. That''s why your throat is so sore. The spirits talk differently to us."</p>\r\n<p>Davin thought it had more to do with the burning smoke than the spirits speech but he did not argue. He was more than content to lie back under her gentle hands and listen to her voice.</p>\r\n<p>"Winaka has told me to tell you that he''s gone to speak to the Captains on your behalf."</p>\r\n<p>"Then I should be there. Ow!" He clutched his throat.</p>\r\n<p>"You should listen to her advice," laughed Winaka from the doorway. "Don''t try and get up. You''ll feel a little light-headed for a while but it''ll pass after a good rest. Did you give him that sleeping potion?"</p>\r\n<p>"He''s only just come out of it," replied Saroya with a shake of her head.</p>\r\n<p>"Then give it to him now."</p>\r\n<p>Davin banged his fist against the wall to remind them he was still there.</p>\r\n<p>"What did they say? Will they see me?" he rasped, returning Saroya’s scolding stare with a defiant one of his own.</p>\r\n<p>"There''s no need. The Gahyashi left on the evening tide. They return to their settlements to pick up the rest of their crew and other ships. By this time tomorrow they''ll be on their way to the Bay of Respite. I have conveyed your orders for them to land just west of Port Canest and travel overland to join the Dwarves in Talgheer."</p>\r\n<p>Davin flopped back into the pillows and stared at Winaka in astonishment. He hadn''t even told the others in his group this part of the plan. How could Winaka have known? What really happened in that tent? Winakas'' enigmatic smile revealed nothing. Davin closed his eyes trying to remember but it was all a blank except... there was... a stag. A stag... and a... a fox. They...</p>\r\n<p>It was no good. It hurt too much. He opened his eyes. Winaka was sitting on the edge of the bed, Davin’s bow resting loosely on his lap. There was no sign of Saroya.</p>\r\n<p>"She had an errand to run," Winaka told him. "I said I would stay until she got back. A nice touch," he fingered the eagles’ feather.</p>\r\n<p>"A gift from a friend." Davin smiled sadly.</p>\r\n<p>"Where is he now?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Irrisal told me he was killed in an attack by Duman."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure?" he demanded. Gone was his casual interest, his tone now as deep and unfathomable as his gaze.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. Why?" returned Davin, intrigued by Winakas'' sudden change.</p>\r\n<p>Winaka did not answer. Instead he laid the bow on the floor and came out with a request that took Davin completely by surprise.</p>\r\n<p>"Take her with you."</p>\r\n<p>"What?" he cried and regretted it immediately when a spasm of dry, rasping coughing seized his already tortured throat. He reached for the glass beside him, sighing with pleasure as the sweet, honeyed wine trickled soothingly past his tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"Saroya. I want you to take her with you when you go," repeated Winaka calmly, replacing the glass on the table.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you mad?" whispered Davin, treating his sore throat with a deal more consideration and respect. "It''s much too dangerous. Rohansuk is in turmoil. Anything could happen to her. She will be safer here."</p>\r\n<p>"If she stays here she''ll be dead before the year is out."</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t know that."</p>\r\n<p>"Just as I couldn''t know of your plans for the Gahyashi fleet? Think, Sir Davin... I know."</p>\r\n<p>Davin’s heart went cold at the finality of the Xaushoi’s tone. He pushed his hair back from his face and saw that his hand was shaking. Saroya dead was a future he could not bear to think of. Blast the woman for storming her way into his emotions just when he needed a clear head! </p>\r\n<p>"What if she refuses to come with me?" he asked bleakly.</p>\r\n<p>"Knock her out... Kidnap her... Marry her if you have to! Just take her away from here! Give me your word."</p>\r\n<p>Davin nodded and allowed his eyelids to flutter down, Winakas'' revelation along with the sleeping potion, finally taking their toll. He felt drained to the very bottom of his being. One day he would wonder at Winaka’s overt insistence and the sly knowing grin that he thought Davin had not spotted. </p>\r\n<p>One day... but not today &mdash; today he just wanted to sleep.</p>\r\n<p>To sleep, not to dream &mdash; but dream he did, about stags and foxes... and red-sailed ships on mountainous shores, about eagle’s feathers and Dragon’s wings...&nbsp;... and empty, hooded, black robes dancing in a forest of fire.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 23, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

Before long he was sitting within sight of the gateway in the Anatol Mountains. It was dull and overcast with little promise for improvement. Jarok huddled down in his cloak to wait. Suddenly, he felt a rush of blood through his veins, as though the tight knot in his stomach that had held it at bay, had been untied. His skin began to prickle, to tingle, almost to the point where the very air itself was too painful for his flesh to bear. He quickly dampened the involuntary response to that part of himself that no longer dwelt within him, shielding it beneath a covering of the Mother’s energy.<p></p>\r\n<p>Alyse had returned!</p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s excitement was twofold. Soon, he would see her again and her departure from Phelise must surely mean that she had located the Crystal Tomb. Unfortunately, without the Mother’s power that Jarok also possessed, she was unable to keep the Powers'' return hidden. Duman would undoubtedly be as aware as himself and the search for Alyse would once again be on. But Alyse had grown strong in the time she had been away. Jarok could feel the depth of control she now held over it and, even if she used it, Jarok was confident the wizard would have a hard time pin-pointing her. There was however, one drawback to this... so would he. With a wry grin he picked up his bow and hurried back to where he had left the horse. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, my friend, we have three options." He patted the horses'' neck and it lifted its head from grazing and snuffled softly into his face. "North, to the Borinian Heights. Vorns Valley in Fellamund, or... No," he shook his head, "I think we can discount the gate in Hur. Somehow, for all his embracing of the Black Arts, I don''t think Duman would hide the entrance to the tomb there. He would want it somewhere independent of those he serves."</p>\r\n<p>His eyes roamed the horizon, north to east. Where would Duman secrete the entrance, he wondered? He had to find Alyse before she got to it. Once she disappeared behind the wizard’s mystical barriers his chance would be gone and without the Crystal of Tears and</p>\r\n<p>the life it held, her journey would be fruitless. Without it, she might even become trapped herself. He had to find her. He had to!</p>\r\n<p>His heart cried out with the despair of the eight-year-old boy he had been and he wished fervently that Cymon were there to tell him what to do. Then, as if in answer to his desire, the earth shuddered and tilted beneath him, as Power was suddenly unleashed into it. Immediately his head spun eastward.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse?</p>\r\n<p>No. It was too little and too raw and too far from any gateway. He leaned into it, sensing for the touch of the controlling essence. He felt only the burning, molten core of the Earth. The Power appeared to be acting on its own.</p>\r\n<p>But who had released it?</p>\r\n<p>The thought that it might be Duman filled him with dread and he flattened himself against the earth and gently called out to it. It surged towards him eagerly. Jarok was filled with relief to sense its innocence and purity. As brushed against him he became aware of all, of the Dragonmarks and the fate of the knight upon whom this one had been bestowed. He had to act quickly. Ecos would also be aware that the Dragonmark had been used and would be awaiting the unspent Power to return. Already it was beginning to manifest itself upon his neck. He could not allow it to complete its journeys'' end in him. Using his Mother’s Power, he wiped it clean of all remnants of his touch and repulsed it. It veered north, resuming its search for the source. Jarok leapt onto his horse and galloped after it. The cry of the Dragonmark would have been heard across the mystical lanes, in which Duman’s magic reigned, like a foghorn across the eerie silence of a shrouded sea. The wizard could not fail to hear it. Jarok just hoped that he was too excited by Alyse’s re-emergence, to have noticed the slight hiccup along the way.</p>\r\n<p>A chill wind blew down from the snow-capped peaks of the Anatol Mountains as Duman’s Shadow rose from its perch. It whistled across the sky, whipping up the soft, downy clouds into thick and turbulent storms that raced menacingly in the Sectus'' wake. A shudder ran through the wind. Jarok felt the twist of wrongness and revulsion deep in the pit of his stomach. He dropped from his horse and laid himself flat upon the ground, digging his fingers deep into the soil. His heart slowed and his breath barely stirred the blades of grass in front of his face as he became one with the Earth and listened to her many voices. He sensed anger, fear and danger. Magic had been cast upon her. Evil. Evil that had taken flight. A darkness that cast a black shadow upon her surface, that lingered in the weak, winter sunshine and chilled her more than the coldest glacier. And it travelled north.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok pulled himself up out of the Earths'' embrace. Duman must have located Alyse, probably in the same way that Jarok himself had found her and sent his minion after her. He recalled the eagle that had been watching the west gate. It surely could not be the same one for he knew he had killed the bird near the gateway... yet it came from the same direction. There must have been two of them. He leapt onto his horse and nudged it into a gallop. He had to reach Alyse before it did. He had to protect her.</p>\r\n<p>Once he had cleared the northern edge of False Ridge, Jarok turned northeast. He avoided all habitation and stopped only for the horses'' needs. The further north he travelled, the deeper winter had already set her silver seal upon the land and he was forced to slow his breakneck speed for the sake of the horse. Apart from causing pain (he dare not use his Power to heal it), a sprained fetlock or a broken leg would only serve to waste valuable time. His breath hung in a misty cloud before his face as he crunched over the frosted earth. Grazing grew scarce and his horse thin until finally, his conscience dictated that its needs must come first. He sat quietly and closed his eyes, listening for the pull of energies that would tell him where there were people. </p>\r\n<p>It was a barrack town, though there were few knights to be seen. The talk in the inn was of troubles in the east and that nearly all the knights had pulled out of Upper Westbrooke to put down the uprising. There was little new to be learned here, so Jarok ate a hot meal and then wandered outside away from the hot, noisy smoke of the inn to get some fresh air. Behind the stables he spied the spreading limbs of a huge oak tree and climbing up, rested in the crook of one of the branches that fit him so comfortably, it might have grown that way deliberately... just for him to rest in. He gazed up at the night sky through the bare branches: the brilliant light of the twinkling stars emphasizing the darkness of the heavens, even as they held it at bay. He looked for the moon and found it lounging on its back, a mere sliver that reflected the frailty of the hopes of Men in his heart. </p>\r\n<p>Were they truly so unaware of the perilous balance of their existence? </p>\r\n<p>When they glibly quoted that ''tomorrow is another day'', did they never pause to consider that ''tomorrow'' hung on the slenderest thread in the dress of Fate? </p>\r\n<p>Had they really grown so far away from the Mother and the Powers that Ruled, that they really believed that Life, Destiny and Death were instruments of their own making? </p>\r\n<p>He thought of Alyse, of Cymon, and of the knights he had met on the border of the Mornay, then cast his mind over the conversations he had listened to this night. Comparing the two, he realised sadly that the majority of Man had indeed grown arrogant and prideful. Had developed a sense of self-importance and power that was not only laughable but also inherently dangerous. If only they had not ceased to listen to the warnings that had been written for them then perhaps they would not have become so. Perhaps they would have been more prepared. And not only Man, for the other races were also guilty of the same prideful arrogance &mdash; even the Elfin. For though they had kept the warnings alive, they had done little to be ready for this day. </p>\r\n<p>But could he really place all the blame on their shoulders? </p>\r\n<p>Were not the Powers that Ruled also in part to blame? </p>\r\n<p>The Mother had tried... by having the ''Books'' written. But what had they done? </p>\r\n<p>Fate? Destiny? Hope? </p>\r\n<p>Even Time Himself had seemed to conspire against her in the silent mist of forgetfulness that followed his passing.</p>\r\n<p>As if their names in his thoughts had awoken them, he felt his eyelids grow drowsy and a dense fog rolled inwards to surround him. He heard voices calling his name. One was hard with outrage, the other soft and understanding. A hand appeared in the fog and when he took it, he felt himself pulled through the blindness into the presence of the two sisters, Fate and Hope.</p>\r\n<p>"How dare you charge us with the faults of mortals? Twice now I''ve been insulted. First that slip of a gypsy and now... I will not stand for this. You..." </p>\r\n<p>Her words were cut off by the delicate laughter of her sister.</p>\r\n<p>"I should still your tongue before you add ridicule to your list of injuries. You can''t threaten this one, Fate. This is not a mortal but Power Reborn. You have no ruling over him," Hope chastised, as she greeted Jarok with the warm embrace of a sister, keeping hold of his hands as she stepped back.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s good to have you returned to your rightful place. My joy will be complete when your uncles are also returned to us."</p>\r\n<p>"Hah,” snorted Fate. "You''ve chosen a puny form to be reborn in, that''s all I can say," she looked him up and down with a glance of distaste.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh?" answered Jarok mildly, a wry grin twitching at the corner of his mouth. "I was merely following your example," his gaze rolled up and down her womanly form.</p>\r\n<p>Fates'' lips drew together tightly and she stamped her foot. Then, unable to ignore the teasing in his eyes she burst out laughing.</p>\r\n<p>"Your father always was the only one who could put me in my place. I''ve missed you... him... you... " She shook her head confusedly and the shrugged and with a squeal of delight, ran to hug him fiercely. "Perhaps that''s why I''ve been so bad tempered lately. Come, we have something to show you."</p>\r\n<p>The two sisters unfolded both visions they had revealed to Eona. Jarok watched thoughtfully, a worried frown etching deep lines in his brow.</p>\r\n<p>"This parchment?" he asked. "What is it and why is it so important?"</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a map of Ak''thai and the location of the Orbs secreted therein," answered Fate.</p>\r\n<p>"But that in itself isn''t why Alyse must not have it. Once Duman knows of it, he will also know of the senders'' identity and will double his defences. Once he does that, your ally in the fortress will be no more... and no-one will ever get through," Hope explained.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok felt himself torn. He had to get that parchment. He needed it and the information it contained. But what of the Crystal of Tears? Alyse could not succeed without it. But even that would be useless if he went for the parchment first. Whatever was after her might find her before he got back and not allow her to free the Ancient Heroes. But Hope had told him that if he were not with the gypsy and the elf, then the youth would not hand the parchment over. He did not know what to do. He turned to the sisters with his indecision. He opened his mouth but Fate held up her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"The decision is yours alone. We can''t help you with it."</p>\r\n<p>"Surely there''s something?" he appealed to Hope.</p>\r\n<p>Her face was filled with sympathy as she shook her head.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s out of my hands... unless?" She turned to Fate, one eyebrow raised in silent questioning.</p>\r\n<p>"Unless...?" Repeated Jarok, the feigned ignorance of his tone at variance with the knowing sparkle lighting his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Fate gazed from one to the other, a grim look darkening her features as understanding dawned. She backed off as they stepped closer to her, shaking her head in refusal.</p>\r\n<p>"No,” she cried with firm determination. "I will not break the Rules."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not asking you break them," said Jarok persuasively, taking her hand and kissing the back of it. "Just... bend them a little."</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t."</p>\r\n<p>"For me? Just this one time, call it a birthday gift."</p>\r\n<p>"No," she repeated but she was wavering and they all knew it. Hope placed an arm about her shoulders and allowed her warmth and compassion to flow over her. Fate shrugged her off.</p>\r\n<p>"I know what you''re up to and it won''t work. I... "</p>\r\n<p>"Then all is lost," Jarok interrupted her, dropped her hand and turned away, his head bowed between drooping shoulders. He watched her face out of the corner of his eye and saw the pained remorse flickering over it. With a sigh of despair he lifted sad, tear-filled eyes to Hope.</p>\r\n<p>"You had better send me back."</p>\r\n<p>"Alright! Al right! I''ll do it,” cried Fate, glaring at their suddenly beaming faces with angry accusation. She pointed a long finger at Hope. "But you can face Father when he finds out. I''m not taking all the blame." </p>\r\n<p>"Agreed," Hope nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I will bend this much... and no more," she added firmly. "You may go to Alyse first and give her the Crystal.&nbsp;But you cannot remain with her for more than one day. Don''t worry, I will ensure that the danger does not find her until after she has fulfilled her quest. After that I will protect her no more and things will return to the way they were. This is as far as I can go."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," said Jarok kissing her cheek. </p>\r\n<p>"Yes, well. I hope you remember this next time you allow your thoughts to run away with you," she chided him and then hugged him again. </p>\r\n<p>"You''d better go. I have the feeling Father will not be best pleased and time may grow short," advised Hope, taking his hand and leading him back into the mist. She placed her mouth close to his ear and whispered; "You''ll find her where the Flow greets the mountains."</p>\r\n<p>Her words had scarcely faded and he opened his eyes onto the sparkling night, jumped out of the tree and made for the stables. The ostler was not happy at being woken from his bed to unlock the doors but his temper was cooled by the gold coin Jarok dropped into his palm. Asking the horses'' forgiveness, he pushed it to the very limits of its endurance. Even though he had the assurance of Hopes'' words that he would meet up with Alyse, he was taking no chances. He could not test Fate (any more than he already had!) by dallying too long. As he rode, another problem began to rear its head. </p>\r\n<p>How was he to pass on the Crystal and reveal its purpose without also revealing his identity?</p>\r\n<p>It was not something that one just happened to pick up along the road. Alyse would surely want to know how he had gotten it and from whom. And if she didn''t, then Cymon certainly would. </p>\r\n<p>Why was nothing ever simple? </p>\r\n<p>With the Borinian Heights looming ahead of him, he was no nearer a solution. What he needed was an ally &mdash; someone he could trust, someone who could keep a secret, someone whose sense of humour would be tickled by the knowledge that he knew something the Dragon did not.</p>\r\n<p>A faint smile tweaked the corners of Jarok’s mouth, travelled along his cheekbones and creased the corners of the earthy eyes that gazed upon the gently vibrating crystal resting in his palm &mdash; a face rose in his mind and reflected upon the surface of the Crystal, a jug-eared face with a mischievous grin and the mark of the Mother on its cheek. </p>\r\n<p>"Purrfect,” he laughed to himself.</p>\r\n<p>The object of Jarok’s thoughts was at that moment leaping nimbly over the rocks, revelling in the peaceful stillness of the Heights after the noisy badgering of the horde of ''hopefuls'' that had constantly dogged his heels during their sojourn in Phelise. A shudder rippled through his sleek, glossy fur as he remembered that if Alyse had had her way he would still be there.</p>\r\n<p>He had done his part, she had said (as they gathered in the parlour of Naemon’s home to say their goodbyes to Cymon’s mother, Mailon and Jerle) and had more than fulfilled the tasks placed upon him all those years ago. Also, since the episode in the Mornay, Duman was now probably aware the A''mathan was still alive and it would be doubly dangerous for him to continue. </p>\r\n<p>"No," she graciously told him, "henceforth, you are released from all promises and oaths and will remain here in the safety of Phelise." </p>\r\n<p>Yushok had no intention of being left to the wolves. </p>\r\n<p>"Not on your golden hide!" Yushok had refused and jokingly replied that he would rather face ten Dumans, than the increasingly incessant demands and overtures of the Elders'' female relatives. </p>\r\n<p>"Popularity! It is such a burden," observed Alyse dryly.</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t know how much," came back Yushok in a high-pitched wail. "It''s been a nightmare. I declare... I am strained to the very core!" He flounced back into the couch with a hefty sigh and flung the back of his hand dramatically across his brow, in perfect mimicry of the many elfin callers who had announced themselves simply ''overcome'' by his mere presence.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse rolled her eyes as the room filled laughter and scolded her companions for encouraging the outlandish elf. Still, she had to turn away to hide the twitching of her lips. She opened the door and closed it as swiftly, as the clamouring mass of teary-eyed elfin desperate for one last glance, word or half-promise surged forward. She turned and gazed with amusement into Yushok’s horrified eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps Royle might stand a better chance sneaking out the back way," she offered facetiously. </p>\r\n<p>"I am not in the habit of sneaking,” insisted Yushok proudly, even as he peeked one eye around the edge of the curtain. Seconds later his tail swished haughtily in the air behind him as he padded down the hallway.</p>\r\n<p>"That still leaves us with the problem of getting through that lot," Cymon nodded towards the closed door. Alyse tutted in annoyance as Royle mewled softly at her ankles.</p>\r\n<p>"It would seem the back way is also under siege," she sighed. "Grandfather?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll do my best," grinned Mailon and reached for the handle, but a smaller hand reached it first. </p>\r\n<p>"Jerle! Come back,” cried Naemon anxiously, alarmed the child would be hurt in the press as her small body was swallowed into the crowd.</p>\r\n<p>"But I want to go and play with Uncle Yushok in the Apple Grove," Jerles'' plaintive cry silenced the mumbling garden and moments later her sweet, cherubic face stood alone in the empty space.</p>\r\n<p>"Clever girl," laughed Mailon. </p>\r\n<p>"You shouldn''t tell lies, Jerle. It''s wrong," Naemon swept Jerle up into her arms but her scolding words were negated by the kiss she placed on the rosy cheek.</p>\r\n<p>"I wasn''t lying Mother-Naemon," answered Jerle. "I never said Uncle Yushok was in the Apple Grove... just that I would like to play there with him," she gazed at Naemon innocently.</p>\r\n<p>Naemon’s mouth dropped open. </p>\r\n<p>"I think someone has been playing far too much with ''Uncle Yushok''," Alyse observed gently but firmly. Deciding that was his cue to make himself scarce, Royle bounded across the grass and nimbly leapt the fence. Alyse and Cymon quickly finished their goodbyes and left by the gate.</p>\r\n<p>Once more, they stepped into the gateway that separated the two worlds. It was like stepping into a kaleidoscope, the air shimmering in multi-coloured particles of time and space that mingled and merged until each was indistinguishable from the other and so, without identity faded into neither. Another step and for an instant the group were lost in complete unawareness. Each found themselves alone in a place void of everything &mdash; neither physical nor psychic, neither solid, liquid nor gaseous, no air, no ground, no sky above, not hot or cold, neither light nor dark, merely empty. Then it was full again. Their eyes moistening under a surfeit of glistening brilliance and they stepped out onto the bleak, cold crags of the mountains covered in a thick layer of snow and ice. </p>\r\n<p>So it was that Royle leapt across the rocks, leading the way. Cymon allowed Defiant to pick his own way down and Alyse’s mare seemed more content to follow the stallions'' lead than to be led. Cymon followed after, helping Alyse down the trickier declines. They camped for one night beneath a rocky overhang and finally stepped onto the snow-covered, grassy plain at the foot of the mountains mid-afternoon on the second day. Though still daylight, Cymon decided they should rest and get a fresh start in the morning.</p>\r\n<p>Beneath her blanket, Alyse tossed and turned. Many times her hand strayed to the growing necklace of tiny Dragons about her neck. Aside from Sir Alnac, three more had returned. Two of the bearers had given their lives in calling upon the ''Mark''. The third, thankfully, still lived. Alyse’s heart was heavy. She had not, she now realised, considered the weight of the burden she would be forced to carry when she had bestowed the Dragonmarks on the knights, though in fairness, Ecos had tried to warn her. She had done it on impulse, never thinking that in saving lives they may lose their own. She felt guilty and remorseful, arguing with the Dragon within her, who said that the one life was surely worth the many that had been saved. To Alyse, who had spent the whole of her short life up until her transformation healing and nurturing, even one was too many. Over and over they argued the point.</p>\r\n<p>''"Oh, leave me alone,” she finally cried aloud, pushing aside her blanket and striding away from the fires'' light. </p>\r\n<p>In the cold darkness she stared into the distance and let the tears flow. Hands slipped around her waist and she allowed herself to be pulled into the reassuring warmth of Cymon’s chest, letting her head slip back onto his shoulder. His lips brushed the top of her head and then his soft musical voice whispered gently against her temple.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s wrong?"</p>\r\n<p>"It is all happening so fast &mdash; too much, too soon. I," she could not go on and turning in his arms, buried her head into his neck. Cymon stroked her hair.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s only the beginning Alyse," he reminded her.</p>\r\n<p>"I do not think I can do this," she sobbed. "Perhaps I should just let... " </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t even think it!" Cymon shook her gently. "If you had the strength to join with Ecos and live, then you have the strength to see it through. You can do it. We shall do it. Together."</p>\r\n<p>Slowly, she lifted her head. The determination and love in his eyes filled her with shame and she straightened her shoulders, wiped her eyes and blew her nose.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes," she agreed, the tentative smile on her lips firming as she curled her arm about his waist and felt his strength flow into her. "Together." </p>\r\n<p>Cymon laid two fingers on her forehead, kissed her soundly and then led her back to the camp.</p>\r\n<p>Armed with their renewed mutual optimism and determination they travelled quickly, hugging the mountains so that they were spared the worst of the gales, whose icy screams froze all that heard them as they carried the heavy snow clouds southwards. They headed west, for the great gorge cut through the mountains by the Borrin Flow and for the place where the dwarf, Tacha, had mined the metal for Borgens'' crown. They had concluded that this was the true significance of the crown in the vision, that the mine itself was the place they were to mark the beginning of their days'' journey to find the bridge.</p>\r\n<p>Standing at the foot of the waterfall where the Borrin Flow dropped off the Heights onto the plain below, Alyse frowned. Amber eyes skimmed the landmarks of river and gorge as one might skim across the words on the pages of a book. </p>\r\n<p>"There hast been many a shift since the Earth and I didst last breathe together. Her face is much altered." The muted tones of Ecos rippled with a sorrowful loss that was accentuated by the cascading rush of the falling water. "All I canst say in certainty is that the Forge didst stand unto the right of the river as we now face it." </p>\r\n<p>"Then we''ll just have to look for it," said Cymon with bright confidence.</p>\r\n<p>"As we get closer the Earth wilt reveal its presence unto me," nodded Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"As good as found,” smiled Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>Twilight was swift approaching so they set up camp. There was little point starting the climb only to have to call a halt halfway up. Cymon had barely fallen asleep when he was woken by a sharp, burning pain shooting up his arm. Alyse was gripping his wrist with incredible strength, wringing the fingers of his hand like a dishrag. Her face was ghostly white, except for the bright, red spots of anger that stained her cheeks. Eyes flaming with hatred and revulsion stared, glazed, into the distance.</p>\r\n<p>Somehow he managed to extricate himself and moved to kneel before her.</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse? Talk to me. What''s happened?"</p>\r\n<p>"Magic!" </p>\r\n<p>Her whispered hiss froze in the cold night air, hanging for a second in the space between them, and then fell upon Cymon’s face with an icy, eerie sting. As it burnt against his raw cheeks the world seemed to shudder to a halt. His heart seemed to stop beating and his chest felt hollow as his whole being was suddenly squeezed in the clutch of a chilling premonition that Alyse was already lost. He sensed an anger not his own. Nor was it that of Alyse, or the Dragon, but anger more ancient even than he &mdash; anger of Time...stolen. </p>\r\n<p>Inevitability... delayed but refusing to be thwarted. </p>\r\n<p>Outrage... disobedience... tampering... interfering. </p>\r\n<p>All this he heard through some sense he knew not how. </p>\r\n<p>Then an overwhelming urge for haste, followed by a faint, soothing compassion and a gentle breath of hope that nudged his heart to resume its beat. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse was speaking. Despite their bond she appeared to be unaware of what he had just experienced and the resulting turmoil of his emotions. </p>\r\n<p>He had to keep it that way, he told himself and schooled his mind into quietness, as she had taught him.</p>\r\n<p>"More powerful than I realised, to be able to cast his spells this far from Ak''thai." The face she lifted to Cymon was that of a wide-eyed, terrified child. "I am not ready, Cymon, not ready. I cannot..." The tremor in her voice broke off into frightened sobs.</p>\r\n<p>Before he knew what he was doing, Cymon heard himself telling her to let Ecos take over. He felt her stiffen, then she pushed herself from the circle of his arm and the look of hurt and betrayal she cast at him cut him to the quick. But at least it had strengthened her resolve.</p>\r\n<p>"Was it not only a day ago you told me otherwise? When you promised me... ''Together''?"</p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t mean permanently," he replied, filled with remorse and trying to undo the damage of his unruly tongue. "Perhaps I phrased it badly. I only meant that you''re tired. We need Ecos to locate the Forge anyway and it would give you time to rest and regain your strength."</p>\r\n<p>"I know exactly what you meant," she refused to be pacified by his attempted apology... or to accept the fact that he was right. She was tired and if she were to get through this she would need every ounce of her strength and willpower. More annoyed now with herself than with him, she jumped to her feet and flounced to the other side of the smouldering ashes of the fire. Cymon sat for a long time watching her as she lay, curled into a foetal ball and pretended to sleep. He could not blame her for reacting as she did. He had totally mishandled the whole thing. </p>\r\n<p>''Nothing new about that'' jeered a laughing voice in his mind and he threw himself back against the ground, angrily willing himself, without success, to sleep.</p>\r\n<p>They rose with the sun and in an atmosphere so icy it rivalled the frost covered ground and the chill of the wintry dawn. They left the horses on the plain and entered the gorge. The climb was hard. The sides of the gorge were steep and littered with loose shale and stones and showed little mercy to an unwary foot. Neither did the tough, spiny grasses that grazed their ankles and hands, like the coarse stubble of an unshaven chin against tender flesh. </p>\r\n<p>They stopped only to search caves and openings to begin with, then, as they progressed deeper up the gorge, every pit, pothole, crack and crevice. Scouring every inch of the icy, snow-dusted cliffs until fading light made climbing too dangerous. One false move, one careless, unsteady hand or tired step would send them plunging into the rocky rapids below. </p>\r\n<p>Tired and bone weary they set up camp for the night. Too exhausted to carry on the argument of the previous evening, they ate and lay back quietly in the comfort of each other’s arms. Cymon gazed at Alyse with loving pride and admiration. She had given her all that day. Using every ounce of strength she possessed. Removing obstacles too large and heavy for Cymon to move himself. Tracing the lines of minerals and metals in the rocks for any clue and reaching mentally into those places too small for them to go physically.</p>\r\n<p>"Keeping the noise down is the most exhausting of all," she explained, when he had told her that she had done enough and on the morrow he and Royle would search alone. "I will be fine come morning."</p>\r\n<p>He yawned widely, stretching his stiff back carefully so as not to disturb Alyse, who had now drifted off to sleep. The hypnotic dance and heat of the flames and the warmth generated by the Power within Alyse soon made it difficult for him to remain awake and before long he had joined her. Moments later, Royle stretched his body from its curled position at their feet and padded silently out into the darkness. A predatory animal that survived by stalking and hunting, the cats'' senses warned Royle they were being watched. He had tried to ignore it, thinking perhaps it was the effect of strained nerves caused by the tension of the day or that he was being overly cautious, but the feeling refused to go away. Finally, no longer able to fight against the natural instincts of the cat, Royle had waited impatiently for his companions to sleep before going to investigate. No sense in alarming them any more than necessary. </p>\r\n<p>Keeping low to the ground and the darkest shadows, he moved stealthily downwind of the position he believed the unknown stalker to be hiding until he came upon the scattered rocks of an old landslide. On soft paws he leapt silently onto the first rock and slipped around the dead stalks of wiregrass that had sprung up between the cracks. He paused. His shoulders were almost touching the ground. He was close. He could feel it. Unsheathing his claws he took another step and leapt down the other side. Suddenly, he was suffocating beneath the folds of something thick and heavy. Spitting and hissing, he tore at the cloth, and cursed himself for being caught like some hapless inexperienced kitten, at the same time threatening every payback he could think of, against his mysterious assailant. Muffled laughter answered his outrage but it was not menacing and the firm that hand came down on his back, held him fast but not unkindly. His anger gave way to curiosity. </p>\r\n<p>''Curiosity killed the cat!'' he reminded himself and renewed his struggles. </p>\r\n<p>"Will you be still?" ordered an impatient voice. "I''m sorry for the cloak but I know what you''re capable of!"</p>\r\n<p>"I wouldn''t bet on it,” replied Royle with a gruff ''reeow'' and a swish of his tail. "When I get out from under here I''m going to... meow, hiss reow... "</p>\r\n<p>"Can you really twist yourself into such a knot?" laughed the unseen stranger.</p>\r\n<p>Royle fell into a stunned silence. He knew the hand that pressed him gently to the ground was human and yet whoever it was had understood every nuance of the feline language. He sniffed at the cloak. It had a familiar tang to it.</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s me... Jarok!"</p>\r\n<p>Royle tensed, his body quivered with uncertainty. Could it be? He sniffed the cloth again. He thought he recognised it but it was different, stronger yet fainter. No. It was a trap. He closed his eyes, pulling his consciousness inward as he visualised the shape into which he wanted to transform himself. But, just as he was about to release his metamorphosis, a heavy restraint quashed the energies before they could begin.</p>\r\n<p>"Do you want to rouse the whole of Ak''thai? Not to mention Alyse... " The annoyance in the voice was in no way impaired by the hushed tone. "Now... promise to behave and I''ll let you go." Royle promised... he really had no other choice... and the cloak was pulled off. Immediately his hackles rose on his arched back.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re not Jarok," he spat at the tall youth squatting beside him.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m just older. I''ll explain later. Oh, for..." He cried in exasperation as Royle struck out with a claw. "You knocked porridge all over the table when Cymon first turned up... you almost lost your tail when that dog chased into the caravan at the gipsy camp... you got hurt in the coppice when I disappeared..."</p>\r\n<p>"Duman has spies everywhere," hissed Royle, unconvinced.</p>\r\n<p>"I never thought I would say this but you really are a ''Royle pain in the neck'',” he snapped, quoting Alyse’s favourite misuse of the cats'' name. "And to think I always took your side when Alyse got angry with you." He pulled the hood off his head. "Look into my eyes A''mathan... and tell me what you see."</p>\r\n<p>Royale’s eyes narrowed to thin slits as he stretched his neck forward. Before he knew it he was pulled into a depth of ancient knowing that made him jump back with a mewl of pain.</p>\r\n<p>"Ecos! Is it really you?" he glanced confused back towards the camp and then at Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"No, Yushok. I''m not Ecos. Even he can only dwell in one form at a time and he has chosen that of my sis... of Alyse. I''m Jarok...or Power Reborn... take your pick. But enough of that, I have less than one day left and I need your help," he said urgently, pulling the Crystal of Tears from the purse on his belt. Royle gazed at it in curious wonder.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" he asked, sheathing his claws and running a velvet pad over the sparkling surface, gasping as the vibrant innocence within sent a ripple of pure love and hope surging along his body.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s the means of unlocking the sorcery that binds the Heroes. Without it Alyse can''t free them. Not alive, at any rate. The only problem is how to get it to her."</p>\r\n<p>"Why can''t you just give it to her yourself? Ah!" Royle breathed in comprehension, quickly picking up the thread of Jarok’s predicament. He sat down and scratched at the itch behind his ear.</p>\r\n<p>"Exactly,” said Jarok. "She''ll want to know where I got it. Who sent me? "</p>\r\n<p>"...Who are you?" Finished Royle. "Why don''t you just tell her you''re back? She''s really suffering believing you dead. She thinks she murdered you, you know. Cymon’s not doing so well either, not on the inside. He loved you almost as much as he loves Alyse... how come she doesn''t already know you''re here?" the thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>\r\n<p>"Because my Power is greater than hers and right now I don''t want her to know. She knows who I was meant to be and if...?&nbsp;Well, I don''t want Duman finding out I survived."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh ho,” chuckled Royle to himself. "The old Dragon is in the dark!"</p>\r\n<p>"And you are not to let on. They think me dead. I wish it to stay that way," warned Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll gloat a bit on the inside... if that''s okay with you. But my lips are sealed."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok frowned at the mischievous grin that stretched the cats'' muzzle. Then he remembered the unique relationship that existed between the A''mathan and his father and he understood and brushing aside the faint twang of envy that came with it, he smiled. Time enough to make such friends for him later.</p>\r\n<p>"So, are you going to help?"</p>\r\n<p>"Of course," Royle glared, indignant that he should even ask. "What''s your plan?" </p>\r\n<p>Cymon and Alyse were still asleep when Royle slunk back into camp. He had barely snuggled down into the warmth of the fire when they woke and had a quick breakfast before resuming their search. Yawning widely, he stretched his tired limbs and arched his back. A quick lick to flatten his ruffled fur and he loped after them. He sprung nimbly up the rocks until he was pacing a few steps ahead, making plenty of noise and playing such an active part in being helpful that Alyse snapped at him irritably for getting under their feet. Satisfied that he had made enough of a nuisance of himself to ensure that his disappearance would not go unnoticed, he gradually edged his way ahead until he came to the place Jarok had described.</p>\r\n<p>Dislodged by the Heights during some point in time, the huge boulder dominated the centre of the river. As if angered by the intrusion, the Flow pounded furiously against the solidity of the trespasser. Turbulent, white-foamed blows hammering vainly, in crashing, misted spray and eddying swirls while the rushing roar of its voice slammed echoing objections along the walls of the gorge. Unperturbed by the violence the boulder sat passively, refusing to yield and forcing the angry waters to seek passage around it. Royle followed the trail of loosened rocks up to a tiny crevice about halfway up the cliff face that was all that remained of the opening to Tacha’s Forge. </p>\r\n<p>"Careful!" Jarok’s urgent warning hissed quietly from above. "I''ve set it to collapse as soon as you stand on it."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m beginning to have second thoughts about this," answered Royle looking nervously at the ground ahead. "Are you sure it''s safe?"</p>\r\n<p>"If it were anyone else but you, I wouldn''t suggest it. Just remember to pull right as you go down. The ledge isn''t far and is wide enough to hold you as long as you keep still!"</p>\r\n<p>"Reoow!" Royle spat with displeasure. "Reassurance is not your strong point. You might want to make a note of that," he added sarcastically.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s not like you to be squeamish," goaded Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"Taking calculated risks and being foolhardy are two entirely different things," argued Royle. "Don''t worry," laughed Jarok. "I wouldn''t put you in danger for this. If you should miss the ledge there''ll be plenty of time for you to transform before you hit the bottom." </p>\r\n<p>"Like I said, you need to work on your reassurance... "</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh! They''re not far away now. Alyse has just noticed you''re missing. Ready?"</p>\r\n<p>"As I''ll ever be," replied Royle and swallowing, took a step forward. Immediately the rocks and dirt gave way beneath him. He twisted his body to the right and prayed he would hit the ledge since it was too dark for him to see anything to aim at. For the first time in his long, long life Royle actually experienced sheer terror, as he fell for what seemed forever, and his grunt of pain as the hardness of the rock thumped against his descending body was lost beneath his cry of relief. Even with his eyes opened to their fullest, he was unable to penetrate the darkness around him. Flicking out his tail he found he was lying frightening close to the sheer drop below and gently rolled over. His whiskers tickled the faint, pale glow of the Crystal of Tears and he hoped that it was all worth it.</p>\r\n<p>"It is. Trust me." Jarok’s voice whispered ever so softly in his mind. "They''re here. Start moaning."</p>\r\n<p>"I should not have snapped at him so," Alyse berated herself anxiously.</p>\r\n<p>"Royle can take care of himself... and then some," insisted Cymon, taking her hand and helping her over a tricky part of the climb. "He''s probably hiding somewhere just so you will feel guilty."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse shook her head.</p>\r\n<p>"No. It is more than that. I cannot reach him at all. Even were he hiding I would be able to sense his presence. There is nothing. He has vanished."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon hid his alarm at this news and increased his vigilance in looking for the lost cat, his keen eyes investigating every little clue that hitherto he had only glanced at. Reaching the rockslide he noticed that several of the stones had been turned recently. If he thought it strange for Royle to be so careless as to leave such obvious clues as to his passing, he disregarded it in his eagerness to find him and followed the trail to the small opening that had swallowed Royle. Laying flat he leaned over and peered inside, calling Royale’s name. A pitiful groan drifted upwards.</p>\r\n<p>"Alyse! I''ve found him. I can''t see anything but I can hear him."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure? I still can sense no trace."</p>\r\n<p>Royle moaned again.</p>\r\n<p>"He must be badly hurt or he would have transformed and gotten himself out."</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''ll have to try to get down there. We need some light and some rope. You stay here in case he wakes up. I''ll go back and get the packs."</p>\r\n<p>He returned quickly to find Alyse almost beside herself with worry. No matter how she tried she could not make contact with the A''mathan. Only the intermittent, feeble moans reassured her he was still alive. Cymon lit the lantern and lowered it into the hole.</p>\r\n<p>"I see him. There''s a small ledge. It broke his fall." He pulled himself back up with a smile that vanished quickly when he saw Alyse tying the rope about her waist.</p>\r\n<p>"What do you think you''re doing?" he demanded, angrily snatching at the rope.</p>\r\n<p>"The rocks here are too unstable to tie a rope around," she replied, waving her hand about her. "And I would not be strong enough to lower you down. It has to be me."</p>\r\n<p>Annoyed at being unable to argue against her logic, Cymon kicked the toe of his boot into the ground. </p>\r\n<p>"What are they doing up there?''&nbsp;Royle grunted silently, as a shower of stones and grit bounced along and off the ledge where he lay.</p>\r\n<p>''Rescuing you. Now be quiet before you ruin everything!'' snapped Jarok. ''It''s not easy blocking Alyse out. Damn!'' </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s head shot up and she stared, frowning deeply, almost straight at the spot where</p>\r\n<p>Jarok was hiding. She closed her eyes, her hands rising palm up, in her concentration.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" Cymon scanned the cliff side.</p>\r\n<p>"I thought I heard something. I must have been mistaken," she shrugged. But the frown did not completely lift from her brow as she fastened off the rope securely and she glanced back up as she slipped the empty pack Cymon gave her over her head. She picked up the lantern. </p>\r\n<p>"I am ready."</p>\r\n<p>When he was satisfied with his foothold, Cymon nodded and she lowered herself over the edge of the opening. Cymon let the rope out slowly until he felt it slacken and knew she had reached Royle.</p>\r\n<p>"Keep a firm hold," her voice shouted up to him. "This ledge is very narrow."</p>\r\n<p>Placing her feet carefully, Alyse squatted down and began running her hands over Royale’s inert form. She could feel no broken bones and decided it was safe enough to lift him and gently lay him inside the pack. As she straightened, the light glinted on something previously hidden beneath Royale’s head. She picked it up curiously and immediately her whole being was flooded with a joy so intense, that tears streamed down her cheeks and she was left gasping for breath. Clasping it tightly in her hand, she cried out for Cymon to pull her up. </p>\r\n<p>Her tear-soaked face had him jumping to all the wrong conclusions and he gazed sorrowfully at the pack, certain that they had been too late, only to then be thrown into complete confusion by her delighted grin. </p>\r\n<p>"Royle?" he asked hesitantly.</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, he is fine," she answered almost dismissively and lowered the pack-wrapped cat to the ground. "Just knocked himself out. There was something else down there, Cymon. Look!"</p>\r\n<p>She thrust her hand forward and revealed the Crystal.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" Cymon held back from the iridescent, blue gleam that drew him like a beacon. </p>\r\n<p>"From the Pool of Life... " It was Ecos that answered him. "Mine Sister hath sent us this gift. The innocence within doth speak to me &mdash; their lives for the Heroes. With this we shalt save those within the tomb." A flush of pink stained Alyse’s cheeks and a soft smile warmed the eyes of the Dragon that blinked slowly into his own.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know Alyse. This whole thing seems slightly suspect to me... too conveniently contrived," he said dubiously. "How can you be so sure? Maybe Duman... " </p>\r\n<p>"Thy concerns art pleasing, and comforting, but thou hast no need to fear, Elf. The Dark One couldst never deceive me in such a matter. I knoweth mine Sisters'' hand as I knoweth mine own. Rest assured. This," she lifted the Crystal of Tears higher, "is of Her creation."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon was still unhappy about the whole situation but he knew he could not argue against the Dragon, who was surely a greater authority in such matters than he. So he turned his attention to Royle instead, who lay shivering with the effort of hiding his irritated impatience at being so completely ignored after all he had been through on their behalf. Consequently, he made a large meal of the fussing attention lavished upon him by Cymon, and eventually by Alyse who was filled with guilt at her neglect of him in her excitement. By the time he had finished with them he decided that maybe it had been worth it after all!</p>\r\n<p>Overhead, Jarok watched Royale’s manipulations with amusement and determined to be around when Alyse discovered the truth of this day and the sly old A''mathan received his comeuppance. As it was, he waited until the sun began to set, loathe to be parted from them again and anxious for their safety. Though he had warned Royle that Duman had already located them and one of his minions was already on its way, something airborne was all the information he could provide and to him, it was not enough. But, as much as he would rather stay and protect her himself, he could not and must therefore entrust her welfare into the hands of the A''mathan. Casting one last glance at the three people dearest to him in this entire world, Jarok rose and walked away. Forcing himself not to look back was the hardest thing he had ever done. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse and Cymon rose in darkness and as soon as the leading edge of dawn softened the midnight coat of night they stepped out on their days travel. Alyse filled Cymon and Royle with the strength to compensate for the lack of food and rest they would have that day.</p>\r\n<p>"The sun does not rest, so neither can we," she had said, as the Power warmed their muscles and pulsated through their veins until they could hear it throbbing in their ears so loudly, they thought their heads would burst. But as the day wore on they were glad of it, for</p>\r\n<p>Alyse kept such a pace that no mortal could have survived without its help.</p>\r\n<p>The river grew increasingly troubled as it rose higher to its source, the deafening roar a pounding silence of foaming, white rush, racing downstream to stay ahead of the heavy mist and spray thrown out by the churning waters. It began to snow. Trapped in the confined stretch of the gorge and unmoved by the crosswind that screamed angrily above their heads, it settled quickly, reaching up to their calves. They lost sight of the river for a while as it disappeared inside the rock but they could hear its booming course and feel the rumblings of its forceful passage beneath their feet. They continued on their path and soon they joined it again, as it dropped in a mighty waterfall into the underground cavern at whose exit it had disappeared. At last Alyse paused. She gazed up at the climb that confronted them and then at the sky. Dusk was falling and it was doubtful they could complete the climb before the sun lay to rest on its western bed. She turned to Cymon uncertainly. </p>\r\n<p>"What do you think?" she asked. </p>\r\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Unless we could fly, we''ll never do it... even with the Powers'' assistance... and Tacha never had that. Mark it here and hope?" he suggested.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse chewed her lip in indecision. Cymon placed his hands on her shoulders.</p>\r\n<p>"It has to be somewhere between here and there," he pointed his finger vaguely towards the middle of the waterfall. "With another burst of Power we can be there in two shakes of a cats'' tail. No offence," he grinned down at Royle.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse agreed but insisted that they both take some food and rest while they had the opportunity. It was dangerous to give so many enhancements in such a short space of time without allowing the body natural sustenance and regeneration, she had explained when Cymon returned that he was not in the least hungry or tired. Indeed, he still felt fired from the gift she had given him at dawn. Once he began to eat however, he suddenly discovered a ravenous hunger that devoured every morsel of food he carried with embarrassing speed and still growled irritably at the empty pack. He looked hopefully at Alyse who passed him some of hers. Red-faced, he thanked her and shared the contents with a mewling Royle. </p>\r\n<p>His stomach eased, if not satisfied, Cymon lay back on a sigh and stared at the deepening sky, waiting for the moon to reveal herself. </p>\r\n<p>"She is coming,” announced Alyse, getting to her feet. </p>\r\n<p>Cymon rose beside her and once again the Power flowed into him. This time it was totally different. As the ebbing tide of that remaining in him, washed forward to greet that which rejoined and replenished it, he was overpowered by its living consciousness and was unable to fight against it as it took control. </p>\r\n<p>He was alive, strong, and indestructible! </p>\r\n<p>He threw back his head, lifting his arms wide as it surged through him with intoxicating intensity. A feeling of pure ecstasy threatened to drown him with the offer of the chance to be and have, everything he had ever wanted and in that instant he experienced a complete understand and empathy with Duman’s desire to possess this wondrous gift. Shock, dismay and shame slammed violently into the pit of his stomach. Joy replaced by disgust. Wonder with revulsion. He opened his eyes to the gentle, soft amber glow of the Dragon.</p>\r\n<p>"Thine welcome doth bring me great pleasure," the rich tones smiled warmly over him.</p>\r\n<p>"But... " Spluttered C''mon, flushing guiltily at the emotions he still fought to contain.</p>\r\n<p>"Worrieth not. Thine heart is pure, as art thine emotions, even though they doth confuse and dismay thee. Shouldst I hath chosen any other than She who is One with me... I shouldst hath chosen thee. For like She, thou wouldst wield with love, goodness and justice."</p>\r\n<p>"I thank you for your trust," murmured Cymon, not quite sure whether he was comforted by the Dragon’s words or not, for now that he was once more in control of himself, he knew he had no desire to undertake the responsibilities Alyse held. </p>\r\n<p>Y’siel’s oath! He did not envy her in the slightest and had no wish to trade places. </p>\r\n<p>Aware of Cymon’s thoughts, the Dragon laughed.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou art stronger than thou thinkest. Thou wouldst do what needed to be done. Trust me." Alyse blinked and Ecos was gone. She turned her face back to the night, as though unaware that the Dragon had even emerged. Cymon’s eyes widened. A mental snap of his head throwing his mind back to the strange, unsettling premonition he had experienced only those few, short days ago. So innocent on the surface, the Dragon’s words touched him with a deeper, inner meaning that left a bad taste in his mouth. Was it a warning? Was it to prepare him... to prepare him for what?&nbsp;What was going to happen that he would find so hard and distasteful? Something... for these feelings rose in him with a surety that shocked him. He blinked, swallowing his confusion and questions for another time as Alyse cried out the appearance of the moon and grabbed his arm. High in the nights'' darkness, the stars twinkled and blinked out in reverence to the silver glory of the shining, full moon as she smiled down upon her sister Earth. With hands held, Alyse and Cymon waited with bated breath, watching her light flicker across the swirling waters. Then, as though she had paused to admire herself in a mirror, she cast her reflection in a sparkling, glacial-blue disc upon the surface of the river where it fell into the open arms of the cavern. The sight cast all other thoughts from Cymon’s mind as he gently squeezed Alyse’s hand.</p>\r\n<p>"You found it," he said proudly.</p>\r\n<p>"No. We found it," she corrected. "Royle, you must stay here. The vision showed only Cymon and I entering the water." </p>\r\n<p>Royle mewled protesting but she stared him into silence and he sat back, preening himself in lazy, sulky strokes. Alyse turned back to Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"Once we enter, we shall have to rely on ourselves as much as we can. Duman may well have been overconfident enough in his secretion of the Tomb not to have placed any defences and I am hoping the Crystal will shield us as from him, as well as it shielded Royle from me. If I draw on the Power... " She did not need to continue.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon drew her close, hugged her tightly and kissed her firmly, then placed his fingers on her forehead before stepping up with her onto the rocks. Looking down on the shimmering circle of ice they paused for a moment.</p>\r\n<p>"We shall be as quick as we can," Alyse called back to Royle. "If we do not return before nightfall tomorrow, go to Symtar and find Sir Davin."</p>\r\n<p>"Go yourselves," Royle muttered under his breath and as soon as they disappeared from sight he jumped up onto the rocks and followed them down the shimmering staircase that led away from the circular opening to the world behind... to the spiral-arched entrance of the icy world beyond. </p>\r\n</div>', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(39, 'Escort to Symtar', 'CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="P" src="P.gif">ockets of militia were forming all over eastern Ansuk. Many had been trained and organized by the various Knights Orders, others had simply banded together on their own. The survival of the latter was precarious to say the least. The group that Velkaan had encountered, led by the man named Tanner was one of the latter. So far they had been extremely lucky, always managing to remain one step behind the marauding goblins. Tonight however, all that was about to change. The men had been complaining all day. They were fed up, they said, of being no more than a burial detail. They wanted to see some action. Other groups were catching live ones... they had not even seen a dead one of their own yet. It was all that Hawk’s fault! The weather was not helping their mood any either. Everything had gone haywire. Snow, rain, sun, hail... it just could not make up its mind what to do. The men were bored with wandering around aimlessly. So much so, that if he did not come up with something soon, they threatened to disband. To keep the peace, Tanner had put the evenings'' patrol up for debate and thus they had ended up just inside the western edge of the Firstoak.<p></p>\r\n<p>It was all very pretty. Silvery beams sparkling like millions of diamonds upon the snow-laden branches of the great trees. A few remaining flakes floating gently onto their shoulders &mdash; the soft crunch of frozen leaves underfoot in the hushed night. The men were happy and excited; they had never come this far before and were looking forward to having some fun at last. They laughed and joked as they strolled through the silent forest. Tanner kept trying to get them to hold the noise down but they ignored him and told him to stop being such a killjoy. </p>\r\n<p>He dropped back, unsettled and anxious. He had spent many a night hunting in the forest, enough to know something was seriously wrong. There was no rustling in the undergrowth. No animals scurrying to safety on the path of their approach. No signs of foxes or badgers. Other night hunters were conspicuous in their absence... and their prey equally so. He breathed deeply to calm himself, opening his mouth wide and stretching his neck to ease the rising tension in his jaws and head. His palms were sweating. A shiver ran down his spine. He pulled his cloak tighter about his body. </p>\r\n<p>On the spur of the moment he decided to climb the nearest tree and see if he could spot anything to account for his unease. Maybe it was just a wolf or something. With so few leaves left on the trees, the full moon had no difficulty penetrating the criss-cross lacing of branches, giving him ample light to see quite a ways into the forest. There was no wolf. Nothing stirred except the fluttering tension in his chest. He inched around the trunk, stepping up into the fork where it split into two. </p>\r\n<p>The men were no longer moving. They had grouped together and were busy filling their pipes or just squatting down for a rest. Talking casually, they might well have been in the bar at the village inn rather than on patrol in a dangerous area. He really was going to have to have a good talk with them later. Suddenly something caught his eye: the luminescent, green glint of eyes. They were approaching fast... and quiet. As they got nearer he could see they were much too big to be a fox or badger... or even a wolf. In fact they were too big for anything he could think of. He heard a twig snap. Only the slightest of sounds but enough to send his head jerking left. More eyes gleamed in the darkness. The men were too preoccupied to notice. Tanner opened his mouth to shout the alarm, and then quickly closed it again. From the direction the creatures were moving (he could see them quite clearly now) Tanner could tell they had no idea he was there. If he tried to warn the others he would give himself away. There was nothing he could do. He was no coward but there were too many of those things and his mother never a raised a fool to die needlessly. Besides, they had brought this on themselves. If they had listened to him they would be nowhere near this place. So he plastered himself against the trunk and kept as still as he could.</p>\r\n<p>Having encircled his witless group, the goblins had set up a blood-chilling moaning snarl. The men jumped to their feet, pipes and weapons falling from nerveless fingers as the goblins stomped forward, lips curled back from pointed teeth like snarling, two-legged wolves. The men huddled into a tight group, fear dripping from their bodies like sweat. Tanner could hear the goblins sniff the air. A bestial howl rent the night. This was too much for one of the men and he made a run for it. Tanner could not make out whom it was but he saw the legs cut out from under him and heard his screams for mercy as he writhed upon the ground. A flash of moonlight on metal as a blade swept downward and Tanner closed his eyes against the choking gurgle that filled his ears. When he opened his eyes again most of his men were already dead, pieces of their bodies strewn everywhere. Some of the goblins had already abandoned the slaughter to feast on the flesh with increasing frenzy. The few that remained alive were on their knees, hugging each other in panic and sobbing hysterically in their terror. Seeing the burnt out results of goblin attacks was one thing, being part of it or even just watching it happen, was something else entirely. Tanner was by no means squeamish. He had slaughtered his fair share of animals during his life... </p>\r\n<p>“But not like this,” he cried over and over in his mind, “never like this”. </p>\r\n<p>He closed his eyes as yet another man was dragged screaming from the group. The goblins seemed in no hurry now and tormented and tortured him mercilessly until finally, blessedly, loss of blood released him into the arms of death and his cries ceased. A beetle skittered over the back of Tanners'' hand and the unexpected tickle, magnified by taut nerves, made him jump. His arm brushed the snow from the branch it was resting on. He froze as it splat onto the ground. One of the goblins turned around, great bulging eyes staring straight up into his. Tanner felt something wet and hot run down his leg as he pressed his body onto the gnarled bark, trying to make himself disappear as the thing started to run toward him. Then amazingly it fell flat on its face with an arrow protruding from the back of its neck.</p>\r\n<p>The Knights Company of fifty men had been on their way to patrol the southeastern border along the Windstone Ravine, to watch for any activity from Ak''thai, when they heard the screams. A good number of the goblins had gone down quickly, taken by surprise and an extortionate number of arrows but after that, despite being outnumbered by their losses, raged a deadly battle. In order to protect Tanners'' few remaining men, the knights were forced to abandon their bows and move in for hand-to-hand fighting. The goblins were as strong as three men with the arms length of two. They fought with weapons, hands and teeth and the knights were soon at a clear disadvantage. Fierce and fearless, the goblins seemed immune to pain and ignored their wounds. They were also much faster than their appearance suggested and the knights found it almost impossible to get inside their reach and out again without sustaining some form of injury. The tables were beginning to turn. Bleeding and tired the knights were forced to fall back under the goblins fury, forming a tight ring around the group huddled on the ground. Tanners'' hopes were dashed and so, since he had already been discovered, he climbed down to join them. At least in a battle he might go quickly.</p>\r\n<p>As the goblins moved to surround them, the knight closest to Tanner rolled up his sleeve and placed his arm against the earth. He began to speak but the words were lost beneath the howling of the goblins. A strange stillness seemed to fall over the forest. A wave of expectancy that even caused the goblins to cease their noise and pause in their advance. Softly, the carpet of leaves on the forest floor began the rustle. A quiet swishing as of a whip being gently swung through the air. One of the goblins gave a cry and lashed downward with his sword. Another shouted in surprise, also waving his weapon back and forth. Soon the knights were forgotten as the goblins'' repeatedly hacked at the swiftly growing vines that twined about them. But faster than they could free themselves, the twisting shoots sprouted and wound themselves around legs, torso and arms. The supple stems tightening and constricting, then thickening to hard, woody ropes that bound them immobile and helpless where they stood. Before long, all that could be seen of the goblins were the ugly, saucer-eyed heads.</p>\r\n<p>"Lorac," said the knight next to Tanner. "Take some men and finish them off. The rest of us will see to these and bury the dead. Let''s be quick about it men, just in case there''s any more about."</p>\r\n<p>When they had done, his men re-grouped to receive their orders. They were in no shape to resume their previous plans so their Captain, Sir Ashel decided his only option was to take the wounded back to the nearest barracks and get fresh men.</p>\r\n<p>"What about them?" asked Lorac, tipping his head towards the decapitated goblins.</p>\r\n<p>"Leave them. What the scavengers don''t take might serve as a warning to others."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a pity we couldn''t take one alive but it would have been too dangerous."</p>\r\n<p>"But you''ve already got one," said Tanner.</p>\r\n<p>"What?" Ashel grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled him close. "What are you talking about?"</p>\r\n<p>Tanners'' eyes darted from Ashel to Lorac and back again. He swallowed the lump in his throat. He had a bad feeling that he had made a terrible mistake. </p>\r\n<p>"The er... the one that the Third Company, Middle Province caught. The one that man, Hawk, is taking... " Tanners voice tailed off at their blank expressions.</p>\r\n<p>"There is no Third Company, Middle Province," said Ashel slowly.</p>\r\n<p>"But he showed me his papers and everything," insisted Tanner in dismay.</p>\r\n<p>"He can''t even read,” jeered a mocking voice.</p>\r\n<p>"But he said... he sounded... he... " Tanner sank to the ground, his head in his hands. "What have I done?"</p>\r\n<p>"Bodged up as usual,” accused another of his surviving men.</p>\r\n<p>"If you lot hadn''t been standing about chatting like a bunch of old women, you might have heard them coming," argued Tanner, getting to his feet and pushing the man in the chest.</p>\r\n<p>"You were supposed to be the leader. What were you doing skulking in the trees while the rest of us were getting killed?" </p>\r\n<p>"Wetting himself by the look of it," sneered the first voice again.</p>\r\n<p>Tanner threw a punch. The man ducked, returning the blow to Tanners'' chin. Another man elbowed Tanner in the back and he spun around, fist flying. The second man went down with Tanner on top of him. Two of the knights dragged him off while Ashel warned the rest of the men back with the point of his sword.</p>\r\n<p>"Save the fighting for the enemy," he shouted angrily, adding with a note of despair as he sheathed his sword. "Mother save us from idiots like these." He turned to face Tanner, trying to control his rising temper at the Man’s stupidity in the interest of getting some sense out of him. </p>\r\n<p>"Now tell me exactly what this ''Hawk'' said."</p>\r\n<p>"He said that his company had caught this one and he was taking it to Symtar for interrogation," replied Tanner. "He said it was drugged, that''s why it wasn''t tied up." </p>\r\n<p>"Don''t forget to tell him you gave him our only horse!"</p>\r\n<p>Tanner struggled against the hands that held him as the rest of his men started laughing.</p>\r\n<p>"If you don''t be quiet I''ll have you all bound and gagged," Ashel’s scathing glare made sure they understood the threat was a promise. "Lorac, you take this lot back. Tanner and I are going after this ''Hawk''."</p>\r\n<p>Ashel’s initial opinion of Tanner came under revision as they rode north. The man was really quite quick and clever; a good tracker who knew what he was about in the country. It was not really his fault that the King had, as yet, refrained from organizing a proper force and there was no obligation to place oneself under the command of the Orders.</p>\r\n<p>''Though the man would have done better if he had, for he was really not leader material,'' Ashel thought to himself. Still, he had tried to do his bit and his best to defend his land, it was a shame it had had such a hefty price... but he was not the first man to make a mistake. </p>\r\n<p>Unlike Velkaan, Ashel and Tanner made their way straight through Perrahove. By doing so (and on faster horses) they were able to make up the days'' head start that Velkaan had over them and by nightfall the next day had intersected their trail. Yesterdays'' snow had dried up and providing it did not rain on the morrow, Tanner assured Ashel he would have no difficulty in following it. He was right and by noon they could see them up ahead. Kicking their heels they galloped towards them.</p>\r\n<p>"Hors cum," said Sula, turning her head to look back at the sound of their approaching hoof beats. "Two peeps. Man give hors. Not know other."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan swore as he reined in and turned the horse, to greet them with a smile. There was no point in trying to outride them on this thing. </p>\r\n<p>"Tanner,” he called. "What''re you doing here? Who''s your friend?"</p>\r\n<p>Ashel had already dismounted, an arrow notched and pointed at Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>"Both of you. Get down," he ordered.</p>\r\n<p>"Tanner?" said Velkaan looking between him and Ashel with puzzled surprise. "What''s going on?"</p>\r\n<p>"As if you didn''t know,” retorted Tanner. "You''re a thief and a spy." </p>\r\n<p>He spat at Velkaan as he grabbed Sula’s wrists and began to tie them.</p>\r\n<p>"Velkn?" she called in a frightened voice but made no move to stop Tanner, though she could have done so quite easily. </p>\r\n<p>"Stop it! You''re hurting her," cried Velkaan, as she winced.</p>\r\n<p>"Good,” replied Tanner and spitefully pulled the knots a little tighter. "You too."</p>\r\n<p>When they were both safely tied, Ashel lowered his bow. Tanner pushed them to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>"Look... " Began Velkaan. "I know what you''re thinking. Yes, I lied to you but I needed the horse. I''m not in any militia and Sula isn''t my prisoner... quite the opposite, she saved my life. But I do have urgent business in Symtar. Information for the King."</p>\r\n<p>"Huh,” snorted Tanner. </p>\r\n<p>Ashel cast him a quick scowl, then looked at Velkaan through narrowed eyes. The youth (for he was not yet grown into a man) showed no fear despite his predicament. His eyes were open and clear, and held Ashel’s gaze without wavering. There had been no hesitation before his words that might imply he was lying and the fact that the creature had made no attempt to defend itself, all seemed to indicate that he was telling the truth... as incredible as it might sound!</p>\r\n<p>"I''m listening," he prompted.</p>\r\n<p>Now it was Velkaan’s eyes that narrowed.</p>\r\n<p>"You haven''t told me who you are yet."</p>\r\n<p>"Sir Ashel. Knight of the Order of the Dragon."</p>\r\n<p>"Never heard of them," replied Velkaan. "Perhaps he''s the spy," he threw at Tanner who threw him a kick in return.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re trying my patience."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan was not sure if the knight were talking to him or to Tanner but he smiled.</p>\r\n<p>"One has to be careful," he quipped.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll give you one last chance to speak," said Ashel firmly.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan nodded. He really had little choice. He began with his name, a short and vague account of his life (some things being best kept private he decided) before continuing to Ak''thai and telling Ashel all about Kretos and his escape. About how Sula had saved him from the goblin attack on the village and how afterwards he had learnt to speak with her and some of what he had since discovered. All the time he watched Ashel carefully. The man clearly knew all about Ak''thai, the wizard and the possible invasion of an army. Velkaan could tell he was sceptical that Velkaan had managed to escape Ak''thai and still held to the possibility he may be a spy, but the information Sula had supplied had intrigued and excited him. Velkaan watched him pacing up and down, one hand rubbing the back of his neck before coming up to run through his hair and finish kneading his pursed lips with his fingers. It was obvious that he wanted to believe it was the truth, for they desperately needed to know something to help them fight these creatures. </p>\r\n<p>"Can you prove any of this?" Asked Ashel, squatting down beside Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>"Can you read? In my pocket," he added as Ashel raised an eyebrow. "It''s a map of Ak''thai and the strength of the wizard’s army. Kretos gave it to me to take to the King. He hates the wizard as much as we do."</p>\r\n<p>"Pah! What a load of hogwash. He''s making it all up to save his skin," sneered Tanner, pulling his knife. "Let''s kill them now."</p>\r\n<p>"Hold your tongue,” snapped Ashel, snatching the knife away from him and stabbing it harmlessly into the ground. Tanner reddened under Velkaan’s mocking smile.</p>\r\n<p>"If I was going to lie, I''d make up a better story than that. Believe me, we''re on the same side. I just... work differently," he offered in his own defence. </p>\r\n<p>Having looked at the map, Ashel was inclined to believe him and so, picking up Tanners'' knife, he cut the ropes. Velkaan smiled his thanks, rubbing his sore wrists but when he made to untie Sula, Ashel stopped him.</p>\r\n<p>"Not that," he shook his head. </p>\r\n<p>"Her name is Sula," said Velkaan, angrily brushing off Ashel’s hands, "and if it wasn''t for her you wouldn''t know any of this. She''s my friend. You either set us both free or take us both prisoner," he insisted, taking Sula’s hands and glaring at Ashel defiantly.</p>\r\n<p>"You saw what they did to my men. We can''t trust them,” shouted Tanner, his voice seething with hate. Sula frowned beneath the cloth that covered her eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Goblins same hate you. Vy? Hate not nice. Make hurt. Sla not hurt. Truth Sla. Sla frind Velkn."&nbsp;She held out her hands to Tanner, turning questioningly to Velkaan as the man cringed away.</p>\r\n<p>"Give him time," Velkaan told her.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s she saying?" asked Ashel, having difficulty understanding the deep, guttural words produced by the thickness of her tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"She wants to know why we hate each other. She says she is a friend and you can trust her. Are you going to?"</p>\r\n<p>Ashel drew a deep breath. There was a long pause of tense silence while he held it. He rubbed his chin uncertainly. Exhaled loudly and then nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"You can untie her, but... " Ashel’s voice hardened, "... one foot out of place and I''ll kill you both. Is that clear?"</p>\r\n<p>"As crystal," nodded Velkaan, releasing Sula quickly before the knight changed his mind. </p>\r\n<p>Ashel decided to keep Tanner with them. He did not want the man going about inciting the locals to come after them, or rather, to come after Sula. The Man’s hatred of her was plain; he made no effort to disguise it. Ashel was not too sure about her himself, though she seemed friendly enough and obeyed everything Velkaan said to the letter. But friend or spy... they needed the information she had. Velkaan too was a mystery. While he was talkative enough, Ashel noticed that he always skirted around the edges of answers about himself and remained something of an enigma. Despite this, he had a likable personality and the further they travelled, the more Ashel was inclined to think of him as a friend, which was more than he could say about the brooding, intractable moodiness that was Tanner.</p>\r\n<p>When they reached Symtar, Ashel took them first to the barracks of the First Order. It was not that he did not trust the King, or those of the court, but given the present climate they were apt to act rashly and seize Sula (and perhaps Velkaan too) before he or Ashel had a chance to state their case. It would be wiser to have the company of someone higher up to speak on their behalf. This was easier said than done. The Regent’s aide flatly refused them entry, without specific information as to why they required seeing him &mdash; on the grounds that the Regent was far to busy to be bothered with every little problem the knights could not handle. He would however make them an appointment if they would care to come back in a fortnight, he told them with a smug grin when Ashel steadfastly refused to divulge his purpose. The Regents aides were notorious gossips and Ashel was disinclined to spread word of Sula’s existence throughout Symtar. Ashel was just about ready to crack the irritating man on the jaw when Lady Luck smiled upon him. The door opened and in stepped Roaban.</p>\r\n<p>"Ashel, what are you doing here?" </p>\r\n<p>"Trying to see the Regent," replied Ashel, glaring pointedly at the aide.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, come with me. I''m just going in to see him myself."</p>\r\n<p>"Now wait a minute,” cried the aide, jumping in front of the Regents'' door. "You can''t just come in here and do as you please. The Regent doesn''t see anyone unless they''re cleared by me first." He puffed out his chest, waving his quill in front of him like a sword.</p>\r\n<p>Roaban took a step closer and leaned over into the Man’s face, his own hard and angry.</p>\r\n<p>"Unless you wish to find yourself patrolling the Windstone Ravine... "</p>\r\n<p>"Actually, that''s one of the things I need to discuss with the Regent," Ashel slipped in.</p>\r\n<p>"... I would suggest you stand aside and stop interfering in Knights'' business."</p>\r\n<p>"You can''t threaten me like that,” screeched the outraged aide.</p>\r\n<p>"No, but I can," said the voice of the Regent, as the office door opened. "Stop all this nonsense and let them in. I haven''t got time to waste while you stand out here arguing. Who are they?" He pointed to Velkaan and Sula &mdash; wrapped snugly in her cloak &mdash; sitting silently on the bench beside the aides'' desk.</p>\r\n<p>"He won''t tell me," the aide almost wailed.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t blame him," retorted the Regent testily. It had been a bad day and his patience was at snapping point. The aide gasped at the slight and pushed passed Ashel and Roaban to throw himself into his chair and hide his embarrassment in his work, refusing to look up until he heard the door close. On the other side, Velkaan removed Sula’s cloak.</p>\r\n<p>"What on...” Exclaimed the Regent. </p>\r\n<p>Roaban said nothing but his eyes widened with surprise.</p>\r\n<p>"It..." began Ashel.</p>\r\n<p>"She... is a goblin," corrected Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>"My apologies," Ashel nodded. "Her people... the... er... goblins, that is," he amended as Velkaan face darkened even more, "... are the ones that are causing all the mayhem."</p>\r\n<p>The Regent listened with increasing wonder and anxiety as Ashel made his report before asking Velkaan to tell his story. When they were both done there was a long silence while he sat deep in thought. The white-grey hairs of his moustache twitched as he chewed on his lip. Leaning his elbow on the table he scratched the back of his head, his tongue clicking against the roof of his mouth. Hazel eyes heavy with indecision, flicked between the four waiting for him to speak, from beneath the single ridge of bushy eyebrows pulled tightly together below his troubled frown. </p>\r\n<p>"What to do? What to do?" muttered the Regent, fingers tapping a tune on the parchment before him. "If I pass this on to the King, it''ll just be one more thing to cause confusion and delay. We''re having the Huris'' own job getting him to do anything as it is. If he''s not consulting the ministers, he''s consulting the astrologers, the alchemists and anyone else he can think of to avoid making a decision. He''s incensed that this... Powerwielder, chose to speak to Davin instead of coming to him and is being deliberately awkward. If I didn''t know better, I''d think he had made a pact with this wizard of yours!"</p>\r\n<p>"Then what do we do?" Asked Velkaan, becoming worried as to Sula’s safety in the hands of this King.</p>\r\n<p>"What we''ve been doing so far. Dropping the King bits and pieces... just to let him think he''s a part of it... then call a meeting of the Regents tonight and make some real plans."</p>\r\n<p>"And Sula?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan did not like the long pause, nor the slight narrowing of eyes as the Regent stared at the goblin. He inched closer to her and took her hand protectively, though what he thought he could do, unarmed in the middle of a Knights'' barracks, he had no idea. Still, he raised his chin defiantly... he would not go quietly.</p>\r\n<p>"No need to get your hackles up, young man," the Regent gave a wry grin and turned to </p>\r\n<p>Roaban. "Though I hate to admit it, we won''t be able to protect her and, friend or no, I fear the worse for her. This map... you''ll have to find the Powerwielder and give it to her... it''s certainly of no use to any of us. And best you take these two with you. Does anyone else know of her?"</p>\r\n<p>"A small group of militia. Most of them are dead... the rest probably won''t be believed anyway. The only one I do have concerns about is their leader, Tanner. He''s here in the barracks," Ashel advised him.</p>\r\n<p>"Can we trust him to be quiet?"</p>\r\n<p>Ashel shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''ll find a way to keep him here without actually telling him he''s under arrest."</p>\r\n<p>"Begging your pardon Regent, but that will be a waste of a good man. He''s a fine tracker. Why not just say that you''ve placed Sula here under guard until she can be properly questioned and let me take him back out with me. Once we''re away from here, I''m sure I can find him plenty to do to keep his mind occupied."</p>\r\n<p>"We certainly need every man we can get," murmured the Regent, then nodded decisively. "Alright Ashel, we''ll do it your way."</p>\r\n<p>"But what about the King? The Lady Alyse... " Roaban interrupted them.</p>\r\n<p>"Can you tell him any more than you have already?" asked the Regent.</p>\r\n<p>"No... but... "</p>\r\n<p>"Then leave him to us and get this where it can do some good." </p>\r\n<p>He stood up and slapped the map against Roaban’s chest. Hazel eyes flicked the group a dismissal and then he dropped back into his chair, pulled his quill from the inkpot, and turned his attention to the mountain of paperwork piled on his desk.</p>\r\n<p>"You still here?" he barked.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45'),
(40, 'Duman checks in', 'CHAPTER TWENTY NINE', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="T" src="T.gif">he door of the Summoning Chamber swung open on a green whisper. The pale soft glow radiating from the Orb fell gently on the gritty, tired eyes of the tension-fraught wizard. Despite the many reports of success and the fact the Shadow was once again on the move, he found sleep impossible. For centuries he had been in sole control. Planning, scheming, creating, manipulating and now, when everything was beginning to climax, he was forced to lay events over into the hands of others while he was stuck here in this prison condemned to the infuriating frustration of having to wait. Any chance of repeating another long distance casting had been well and truly thwarted, the Black Runes having closed ranks and re-asserted their domination, by resealing the bonds that held him within the fortress to cover his psyche as well as his physical. The knowledge that the seepage of their energies had been riddled with doubt and fear, that he was growing too powerful for them to control, was scant comfort at such a crucial time and did not compensate for the intensity of his disturbed mind. All he could do now was watch.<p></p>\r\n<p>Pulling magic from the mist he summoned the rune of Aukrah, the Imager. With the backs of his hands together he pierced the coil of the intricately swirled configuration with his long fingernails and tore it apart. Wider and wider the hole in its centre grew, sparking resistance overridden by an influx of his own recently created rune, until Duman was satisfied enough with the size of the portal revealed inside the sinuous, writhing contortions of the runic framework, to cast a binding spell to hold it in place. He turned to the Orb, set upon its carved tripod within the pentagram inscribed across the tabletop. Placing one palm against the cold crystal he closed his eyes, blocking off all other thoughts as he summoned forth the Dragon. Soleb responded in an infusion of pastel-toned submission, filling the Orb quietly and thickening gently. Only when it brushed the inner surface, making contact with that place where only the clearness of its prison separated it from physical contact with Duman’s palm; did it flare in violent, scarlet hatred that fired the temperature of the Orb’s surface so that the smell of burning flesh seared</p>\r\n<p>the air and plumes of smoke drifted up through the wizard’s fingers. With a sneering laugh, Duman sent the bolt streaking back. Scarlet laced within a dense net of black sent the Dragon recoiling into a tiny, flaming sun at the Orb’s heart.</p>\r\n<p>"As usual, we learn to understand each other." </p>\r\n<p>The silent jeer dripped around the interior of the Orb like a black wash of dirty water and closed in upon the essence of Soleb with arrogant superiority, enwrapped and invaded it and began to siphon off the power Duman required. Up it rose, ripped from the futile resistance of its Being into the palm of Duman. Sucked by his dominating will, to merge with the source of his power and spat forth from the outstretched fingers of his free hand into the waiting portal. But, along with the Power of the Dragon, Soleb’s rebellion also entered the fray, threatening to overload the delicate balance of casting and in roaring thunder; the clash of opposing energies shook the room. Clenching his teeth to maintain his control, Duman gathered his rage into a single, mental shaft and thrust it into the very core of the Dragon’s essence. Scarlet blaze ebbed and fluctuated in variegated hues of pain, rebellion waning once more into salmon-pink submissiveness. </p>\r\n<p>The noise in the room abated and the shaking receded to no more than the steady thrum of the warding runes that protected the room. A short moment later the chaos within the portal stabilized, unfolding shapes, colours, scenes... blinking in and out... on and off... one to another to another. Moving his free hand as though turning the pages of a book, Duman flicked through them until he found what he wanted then, releasing the Dragon, he settled back in the chair to watch as the figure of Ishkat stepped into view standing on the outskirts of the smouldering ruins that had once been the thriving town of Perrahove.</p>\r\n<p>Unaware of the invisible eyes that watched her, Ishkat stared north, contemplating her next move to the backdrop of screams and laughter. Beneath the fiery, orange glow that lit up the midnight sky, grachtan soldiers continued to run amok. For six days and nights now she had allowed them to tarry here, kicking her heels while they savoured to the finest excellence, every last drop of pleasurable delight and satisfying enjoyment they could squeeze from the torturing and killing of the remaining inhabitants (whom she had specifically spared on the night of their initial attack for this purpose) in a placatory gesture after what had been for the most part, an fairly uneventful and uninspiring campaign. </p>\r\n<p>Where was the fun and sport the Great Father had promised &mdash; the glorious battles and victorious defeats of the enemy armies? </p>\r\n<p>Where were the enemy? </p>\r\n<p>The last came riding upon a sneer of contempt that the soldiers of this race of Man feared to face her. Why else would they flee before her to hide in that place they called Symtar? </p>\r\n<p>She turned back to the blackened ruins. With long, forceful strides she pushed through the persistent shadow of hovering smoke, drawing a deep breath of burning wood, charred stone and roasting flesh that clung with acrid tenacity on the edges of her nostrils and tainted the sensitive buds of her thick, black tongue poking through razor-sharp teeth that bit down in grim masochism until the hot, sweet blood slid down her throat. Rocking from side to side on the balls of her feet, her eyes rolled red &mdash; red with the Bloodlust, red as the shooting flames, still flaring amongst the raped and ravaged town and its surrounding countryside. Flames she kept constantly re-fuelled. Roaring, crackling, in spitting consumption, the avaricious flames chased over trunks, branches, wagons, furniture, cloth and flesh alike with the same, soulless indifference. Who or what they consumed mattered nothing. Only the desire to burn, to exist, to multiply, swept their licking tongues searching for more and more fuel. And with the same soulless, burning indifference, Ishkat threw back her head and released her own impassioned yearning, for the fuel to feed her Bloodlust, in a heart stopping, mind-bending, demonic howl that chilled the spine of even the most hardened and unfeeling gracht.</p>\r\n<p>An evil grin remained as her passion cooled into mere anticipation. The latest report from her spies had told that a huge army had been seen entering Symtar, about the same time as she had began her assault here. At last she would face a worthy opponent. Something more than the squealing, snivelling cowards of previous slaughters. At least, that was what she hoped and why she had kept the fires raging, the sky ablaze: as a signal, a warning, and a challenge to that arriving army. To tell those ensconced behind the walls that she had arrived. That the reprieve they had gained while she delayed here should be well spent in preparing their defences. That they were next and that all the stone in the world would not keep her out!</p>\r\n<p>Once again her eyes began to cloud over in a red haze. The howling challenge clawing its way up from the pit of her stomach, passed her blood-tainted throat and over the ripped flesh of her tongue. But this time it did not fill the night in a lonely monotone but was joined by the answering calls of the goblin horde now spilling from the tunnel to swell her ranks for the morrows'' march.</p>\r\n<p>Duman watched for a while longer as Ishkat began rounding up the gractan soldiers, assembling them once more from a rousing rabble to an invading army, and left what had been Perrahove, to march north to Symtar. </p>\r\n<p>Duman turned the pages of the portal once more, scanning with only mild interest the activities of other of his minions and wishing that he was able to call more than just those under his control for his scrutiny. How he longed to see what the progress of the girl and her allies had yielded. What plans they plotted. It would make his waiting, not to mention the direction of his forces and energies, so much more profitable. </p>\r\n<p>Why could the Black Ones not grasp the fact that these chains with which they bound him worked against them, as much as they hampered and irked himself? </p>\r\n<p>His triumph would be so much easier if... The images flickered into the squat, muscular figure of Ishtak and Duman’s straying thoughts were cut off as he concentrated on the unfolding scene. </p>\r\n<p>The male goblin was in the thick of the fighting. Storming along the streets of Eihaven with little regard for flying arrows or rushing bodies armed with sword and axe. He brushed all aside with the same contemptuous swipe of shield and rajbak (the goblin double bladed sword) as though swatting flies, heading determinedly for the river and the barges moored there. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted a group of knights, slipping from one of the buildings and edging their way along the shadows, axes in hand. He ran to cut them off, for their intention was clear. They meant to scuttle the boats. Four of the closest gracht saw him go and followed, whilst two others, obeying his pointing finger, moved in a flanking run around a large store of barrels to come up behind. The end was swift for the poorly armed knights and Ishtak, after ordering the six gracht to guard the boats, eagerly rejoined the fray.</p>\r\n<p>The survivors had fallen back into the barracks, desperately trying to stem the attack with flaming arrows to enable as many as possible to escape from the rear. They hung on grimly against impossible odds and the overpowering stench of burning gracht that were falling ever closer to the windows. When Ishtak arrived he was quick to realise what the defenders were up to and, leaving a covering section in place, took a large force along the street and surrounded the building. Those trapped inside rallied valiantly, to give their comrades time to get away. But eventually their arrows ran out. So too, their spears and axes and whatever else they could find to hurl at their attackers and they were forced into hand-to-hand combat as the enemy stormed the building. Combat for which they were seriously outmatched by the long-armed goblin and the massive gracht. Elsewhere in the town, the remaining gracht were employed in the wholesale slaughter of every living thing they could find. What could not be killed was burnt. </p>\r\n<p>It had been just after dusk when the Ishtak’s horde had descended and by the time the moon reached its zenith, there was nothing left save a smoking husk and a dozen barges. Having ordered several groups out after the escapees, Ishtak prodded the debris for a tasty morsel that had not been cooked to a crisp. His fever for the kill had broken, to be replaced by a ravenous hunger. A pig, a goat and something thin and stringy later, his stomach was sufficiently sated to allow him to sleep. Tomorrow they would drag the barges as far as False Ridge where he intended to split his force, sending a small raiding party up river as a decoy while the main body skirted the ridge and attacked Talgheer from the south. Taking off his skull helmet, he lay back to dream about his mate and their life to come in the new world they were creating.</p>\r\n<p>Back in Ak''thai, Duman smiled to himself. Already aware of Ishtak’s proposed plan, he was more than satisfied that all was proceeding, as it should. He would have been less happy if he had taken the time to peruse the rest of the flickering images the portal was prepared to offer instead of deciding he had seen enough, dismantling it and releasing the captive runes. Had he chosen otherwise he would have seen the shadows solidify along the rivers'' edge. A sinister, dense blackness rolling like mist up the bank and across the rain sodden ground. Tired and weary a group of escapees ran directly towards it. Behind them they could hear the heavy footfalls of their pursuers, who were making no effort to hide their presence.</p>\r\n<p>"They''re still coming," wheezed one of the men unnecessarily, leaning on his sword as they stopped to catch their breath.</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t say," snapped another, kicking the Man’s sword from beneath him. "This way. Maybe we can lose them in the water."</p>\r\n<p>"I wouldn''t bet on it," replied the first, forcing his legs to move as he glanced over his shoulder and cried out, "they''re gaining fast,” and then ran smack into the back of his companion. Winded, he dropped to his knees and found himself staring into a sea of tiny black eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"What the...” he gasped breathlessly, only to be even more astonished as the sea parted to allow them access. "What''s going on?"</p>\r\n<p>"I haven''t a clue," shrugged the man next to him, dragging him to his feet, "and I''m not of a mind to stop and ask. Let''s go!" As soon as the two-legs had passed the rats reformed their line, waiting until the pursuing gracht were almost in their midst before surging over them in a frenzied flood of screeching teeth and claws &mdash; a biting, gnawing, slashing blanket of fur. For every one the panicking gracht ripped away, two more took its place, their furious hatred doubled by their siblings'' demise. Now the prey instead of the predators, the gracht went down under the sheer weight of numbers. They tried desperately to shield the vulnerable areas of their bodies but their efforts were in vain. The rats took heavy losses but their persistence prevailed and when it was all over they dragged their fallen family back to the river, leaving no signs of what had occurred. Three other groups from Eihaven had also made good their escape with the help of the rats but four more, those that had turned away to the south had not fared so well. They had been run down and disposed of, their bodies carried back to Eihaven for the evening meal.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, Ishtak had started his final march upon Talgheer, ignorant of the silent, four-legged army now following in his wake. Strangely, after their initial reluctance to aid the two-legs, the rats now rallied eagerly. After centuries spent running and hiding they had finally struck a blow back... and it felt good! They would join in this war and afterwards... who knows?</p>\r\n<p>But of all this Duman was ignorant. Only that which he had taken the time to peruse did he know. That and the reports that came his way... and there were few with courage enough to bring those they knew would be greeted with his displeasure. And so in his minions’ selectiveness, Duman found the progress of his campaign moderately pleasing enough to satisfy, at least in part, a portion of the frustration of his enforced isolation. Temporarily uplifted he left the Summoning Chamber and trod lightly through the corridors in pursuit of some much needed diversion. </p>\r\n<p>He had a hand on the doorknob of the entrance to the upper pens when he came to the conclusion that the restored relaxation of his mind would be better served by training it on more serious matters. His Absorption spell could really do with a few refining tweaks and he also really should do a little more work into whether it was possible to dispose of his Shadow (once its mission had been accomplished of course) without causing any immediate or future harm to himself. Further consideration had convinced him it would be unwise, if not outright dangerous, to allow its existence any longer than necessary. It was not inconceivable that the Black Ones would object to his ultimate goal, especially since it consisted of the consolidation of the many into one Supreme Being... that ''Being'' being Duman... naturally. It was more than likely they would attempt to channel themselves into the Shadow when this intent became known and the fact that his own psychic connection with the Shadow offered a conduit for their use, made the possibility, a probability. And the fact that that probability existed, however tenuous, spelt the end of the Shadows'' short life. He had not come this far to be brought down by a weapon of his own making. </p>\r\n<p>The first rumblings began a few days later as he sat secreted in his tower; immersed elbow deep in scrolls, scraps and worn-down quills and squinting the tiredness from his sore eyes to re-focus his blurred vision on his latest scrawls. Snapping the quill in his hand, he spat upon the parchment in disgust and screwing it into a ball, flung it across the room to join the growing pile of discarded failures. The back of his neck began to ache again, rekindling the persistent, nagging headache that had plagued him all day. Mumbling yet another healing spell, he pulled a fresh sheet of parchment and lowered his head. </p>\r\n<p>He had barely managed a few lines of jumbled runes before the effect of the spell started to wear off and the pain returned, accompanied by a growing nausea. His brow beaded with fever as vicious cramps clawed at his stomach and he doubled over his desk in agony. So intense was the pain that he was not even able to move his lips to mutter a moment’s relief. For one insane moment he thought he had been poisoned. That he was actually dying and all his strivings had been in vain. And then his mind exploded, shattering like broken glass as his psyche reeled with the clashing ring of striking blades. </p>\r\n<p>All pain forgotten, he shot out from behind his desk and threw back his head in a wail of angry delight, his dark scowl of rage contradicting the laughter of his eyes. Throwing open the door he stomped purposefully down through the fortress, ignoring the unlit torches and lighting his way only when he approached the stairwell leading down to his Casting Room. </p>\r\n<p>Inside he held out his hand and from high on a shelf, a dust-encrusted scroll lifted itself from its centuries-old bed of cobwebs and drifted down in a waft of musty staleness onto his palm. Cross-legged within the pentagram, he blew the dust off the scroll, lit the black candles and started his incantation.</p>\r\n<p>"J''sakrah ak. Maagrun xansu."</p>\r\n<p>The candles flared brightly &mdash; thick grey smoke belching from their black flames.</p>\r\n<p>"Inzoriak zoria. Petik balindren."</p>\r\n<p>The room began to shake. </p>\r\n<p>Un-summoned runes appeared upon the stones of the walls as the others tried to stop him. His voice thickened to drown the noises of their interference. The place he sought was created from his own essence and though leagues distant, far beyond the walls of Ak''thai, was part of him, therefore negating the sorcery that bound him. They could not stop him but that would not stop them from making it as difficult and draining as they could. The energy he used here would leave him less to use at his destination. He called upon his own rune to absorb the excesses of their meddling and continued. By the time his eyes reached the last line on the scroll, he was enveloped in a bank of black cloud that obscured everything but the final words. He drew a deep breath &mdash; his voice falling in soft cadence as he completed the chant. </p>\r\n<p>"Huria... Vinnai... Zorix... Inzoriak!"</p>\r\n<p>Like a rushing wind his mind howled along the astral planes. Beyond the realms and rules of psyche and out into the vast dimensional void of Dark Sorcery, plunging down into the black pool of magic and bursting up, as a drowning man, to gasp deeply of the green mists of magic. His thoughts rumbled mockingly across the ice.</p>\r\n<p>"So, you have found this place at last? How nice of you to come!"</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(41, 'Dwarves show their worth', 'CHAPTER THIRTY', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="B" src="B.gif">y the time Davin and his companions made contact with the waiting Elfin, the first of the skimmers (the swift vessels used by the Conclave for inter-island communications) was approaching Katajao; the neighbouring island to Katatuk; with the message for absolute mobilization, which would in turn be passed along the entire chain of the Dwarven homeland. With typical Dwarvish organization and ingenuity, those ships still in port were out rigged with side runners and slung with strong meshing attached to the main hull. In this manner their loading capacity was increased threefold and by the morning tide the first wave of the Dwarvish fleet (six skimmers carrying the six Katas and a hundred soldiers apiece) were riding full sail towards Rohansuk.<p></p>\r\n<p>Less than three days later the larger cargo vessels, had been loaded and boarded, and the remaining fleet gathered at anchor just off shore of Qipcha. Those left behind lined the docks and shoreline and raised a tumultuous cry as the great horn blew and the sails unfurled and fluttered open, bulging like pregnant mothers as they filled with the rushing life of the wind. The horn blew a second time and the crowds roared again at the rasping thud of the rows of double oars being pushed out. A third time the horn sounded. This time Qipcha fell silent and then, as the anchors clanked and the oars fell with a rolling splash into the waters, the crowds waved their goodbyes into the heaving creaks of the massive vessels as they broke the cresting waves. Not until the last of the ships dipped over the horizon did the people of Qipcha return to their duties.</p>\r\n<p>Across the dividing waters Burtak too, scanned the waters for sight of his countrymen. He had spent most of his time since Davin and the others had left in the watchtower, eye glued to the long-glass, willing the green and yellow sails to appear. Below him, Port Canest had fallen apart: the ships sat stagnant, the docks empty of the usual chaos of harbour life, cargo strewn everywhere, looted, wrecked or rotting. Footsteps were heard creeping in the shadows. Voices whispered. Music and laughter died under the sword of terror and fear. Even the hardened sailors preferred the relative safety of their ships to shore leave. </p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="PortCanest" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Port Canest" src="PortCanest01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>The heart-chilling grip that held Canest had nothing to do with the cold of winter. It had begun with the attack on the first day they had returned. Normally, the locals of the port were indifferent to the frequent, drunken brawls in their streets. To them it was an integral part of port life. An inevitable trade off for the prosperity they gained by living at the hub of Rohansuk trading. But when the violence began to spill out of the drinking houses into the shops and stalls of the market, threatening both their purse and their being, they began to look around and notice, with growing unease, the sudden influx of inland strangers amongst them. Hard eyed strangers with menacing faces and swaggering steps congregating in large groups on corners, in tavern doorways and along the docks, baiting the incoming sailors with jeering words and obscene gestures even before they had left their ships. Alarmed, the harbourmaster had sent runner after runner to the Knights'' barracks at Brookes Head, pleading for aid, but none returned and the knights remained conspicuous in their absence. </p>\r\n<p>Two days ago, a merchantman bearing the Symtari flag had anchored in the bay with a cargo from Fellamund, bound for overland hauling to Eihaven. As usual, the Captain and his crew had come ashore and dispersed into the taverns. Later that evening the Captain became embroiled in an argument concerning the knights and the Kings'' rule during which he was prolific in his opinions of their worth and values and laughed with outright scorn at the tales of the liberating Master who would free the people from their servitude. That night his ship was set to the torch and his body was found quartered, outside the harbourmasters'' door the next morning. Panicked, the people had locked themselves indoors. Few venturing out since to brave the brutality of the patrolling gangs who had now completely taken over the port, making the inhabitants virtual prisoners in their own homes and threatening to set alight any ship that tried to leave. For the Captains and crews, their vessels were their livelihood and so they played the waiting game in order to protect them.</p>\r\n<p>Burtak also waited. Searching the rolling waves until finally, his patience was rewarded.</p>\r\n<p>Mid-morning, the first sail appeared on the horizon. By their speed he guessed they were skimmers and by the emblems they flew, he picked out the one carrying the Katas. He scrawled a quick note, giving brief details of the situation, and tied it to Mirka’s leg. Mirka flew straight to Rhodka, alighting on his outstretched arm. He stroked her head, untied the note and jigged his arm so that she hopped onto that of the soldier behind, who promised meat. A dark scowl descended on Rhodka’s face as he read Burtak’s warning and he beckoned the other five Katas to him, passing the note to each.</p>\r\n<p>"Annuk, how long before we reach Canest?" he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"At our present speed... some time after noon," replied Annuk after squinting from sky to sea and then to the high cliffs at the opening to the Bay of Respite.</p>\r\n<p>"No good," said Rhodka, shaking his head and ordering the Captain to send the signal to drop anchor. "We''ll need the cover of darkness."</p>\r\n<p>The others agreed and after a brief consultation, Rhodka tied their reply to Mirka’s leg and sent her back to Burtak. </p>\r\n<p>The skimmers drifted in quietly.&nbsp;Their occupants slipping silently up the rocky shoreline to meet Burtak, who gave them a quick but thorough layout of the port. The lower streets were taverns, shops and inns. In the centre were the public buildings and above them, the houses of the Canestres. The eastern section consisted of warehouses, stockyards and animal markets. </p>\r\n<p>"The main road out of Canest also runs through that area," he told them. </p>\r\n<p>"Are there any Knight defenders at all?" asked Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>"No," Burtak replied. "Only the port orderlies, under the command of the harbourmaster, but they were amongst the first to disappear."</p>\r\n<p>"Then we''re on our own. Ulrak, Annuk and I will each take two Tehgra. Ulrak, you skirt around and come in from the north. Burtak will go with you. When you''re in position, or if you''re spotted, send up Mirka... her call will sound the attack," he added as Burtak nodded. "Annuk, once we''ve taken the waterfront, you''ll secure the warehouses and the eastern sector. I''ll attack inwards and meet with Ulrak in the town centre."</p>\r\n<p>"First Kata, what about the locals?" ventured one of the soldiers.</p>\r\n<p>"Will stay indoors if they have any sense. But other than women and children... scratch that. Anyone you''re unsure of, consider the enemy and deal with accordingly. I''m sorry Mawbek..." he said quickly when the Chronicler started to object, "... but we''ve little time before the other ships arrive and we can''t take any chances. The rest of the men will stay here with Mawbek, who will send reinforcements should we need them. Is everyone clear? Good. Take your positions."</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka moved in towards the town as close as he dared then settled down to wait for the signal, using the time to take stock of the enemy positions. With the slovenly ease of the over- confident and the brave-in-numbers, the occupiers of the port sauntered from tavern to alehouse, loud in their drink and in their successes. Even those supposedly standing guard along the docks and street corners, did so with jugs in their hands rather than weapons and with drunken banter rather than alertness, bouncing crudely through the night.</p>\r\n<p>"Doesn''t look like it''s going to be much of a fight," a voice grumbled softly.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh,” hissed Rhodka. </p>\r\n<p>Although they were too far away to be heard above the noise from the taverns and well concealed by the night, Rhodka felt a strange unease and was taking no chances. His instinct seemed correct when a cloaked figure stepped from the shadows and seemed to stare directly at them. An involuntary shudder rippled down his spine as moonlight blinked across the blank face beneath the drawn-up hood, illuminating almost skeletal features. Skin, bleached-bone white, stretched over a fleshless mould accentuating the dark hollows of deep-set eyes and the pale, thin-lipped grin pulled taut over discoloured teeth. The shadowy figure walked forward, a slow, shuffling gait that gave it an even more menacing appearance. Rhodka waited, expecting a cry of alarm but instead the figure reached up and, as though he had seen enough, pulled the hood further over his face and moved back into the shadows. </p>\r\n<p>"What did you make of that?" Annuk whispered a strained voice, also clearly disturbed by the strange presence. Rhodka rubbed the back of his neck but before he could answer, Mirka’s screech pierced the night and he was happy not to have to think anymore.</p>\r\n<p>The Dwarven battle cry resounding before them, Rhodka led his countrymen into battle. The first few skirmishes were won by surprise, with most of the enemy falling with jugs still in their hands. Rhodka and Annuk parted company. Dividing his two Tehgra into groups, Rhodka entered the lower taverns. Again speed and surprise took the edge, as the bleary-eyed brigands failed to summon ale-soaked wits enough to put up any real defence. The dwarves swept through into the next street but here, things began to change. </p>\r\n<p>Though the evidence of their drinking was present in their red-rimmed eyes, the spillage of cask and jug running in rivulets along the guttered middle of the street and the overflowing vessels on the alehouse tables, the men appeared suddenly and unnaturally sober as they charged at the dwarves entering the premises. They fought hard. Still they were few, far fewer in fact than the smoke-filled room and platter-packed tables suggested should have been there and were no match for the skill of the dwarves, who ploughed through and onwards, but each row of subsequent buildings yielded more adversaries and greater defences and each took longer and longer to subdue. Almost (Rhodka realised with sudden insight) as though they were delaying tactics, to hold the dwarves back long enough for the real battlefield to be prepared.&nbsp;Sure enough, as they reached the first set of public buildings they spied the blockades strewn across the street corners and doorways. Holding their shields high, the dwarves rushed the defences. A number fell to arrows and spears, as was to be expected, but Rhodka was confident that at close quarters they would have the edge. Once inside the barricades however, they found no combat, only the backs of their fleeing opponents and a hail of flaming arrows from unseen targets somewhere in the upper stories. Rhodka called his men back. </p>\r\n<p>While he was trying to think what to do Mirka descended. Ulrak had also come to a standstill and was requesting instructions. Rhodka cursed silently. Losing men in fair battle was one thing but he was not prepared to risk their lives against the odds. What they needed were larger shields to protect them. He had an idea and after sending Mirka back to Burtak telling him to use whatever materials he could find in a similar fashion, he sent some of his men back to collect the tables from the taverns.</p>\r\n<p>"Make sure they overlap and keep well in from the edges," he ordered as the dwarves lifted the tables over heads. "And stay single file."</p>\r\n<p>Again the dwarves advanced. Flaming arrows, oil and more flaming arrows showered down on them. The oil splashed harmlessly to the ground and the thick wood of the tables easily withstood the thrust of arrows and lick of fire. By the time they gained the relative safety of the doorways they resembled fiery, multi-legged hedgehogs. But there was no time to rest or catch their breath, for as soon as they entered the buildings they were rushed from all sides. Hacking and slicing they fought back, only just holding their own against this new foe &mdash; a foe that seemed not to know the meaning of pain or the incapacity of wounds. If they lost one arm, they merely used the other, less effectively, but swinging their weapons wildly enough in such a small space to have a good chance of hitting something. Bodies torn and slashed and awash with blood, they refused to fall, flinging themselves upon the dwarves with bared teeth when they had no other means with which to fight. Like rabid dogs they kept coming, frothing at the mouth in their unfathomable madness. </p>\r\n<p>Skilled they were, brave and steadfast the dwarves, but they had never, since the time of the Huri Wars, encountered such insane and possessed fierceness that resulted in complete disregard for life. Rhodka sent back for reinforcements, both for himself and Ulrak. With fresh soldiers and fresh orders of decapitation, after it was discovered this was the only means of stopping these creatures (he had quickly stopped thinking of them as men), they began to gain the upper hand. There were few of them left when they seem to freeze momentarily, their heads cocking to one side as though listening to silent voices. They suddenly retreated through the rear of the buildings into the next street.</p>\r\n<p>The battle had now reached the very hub of the town where four large buildings: </p>\r\n<ol type="1">\r\n  <li>The Courtrooms to which the Knights representative came four times a year to pass sentence upon those prisoners present. </li>\r\n  <li>The Money-house, where all legitimate transactions were arranged, as opposed to the shadier deals agreed in the taverns. </li>\r\n  <li>The Archives where all legal documents were stored as well as it being a place of public study. </li>\r\n  <li>The Apothecary and Alchemist Centre &mdash; where those of reputable standing practised their healing &mdash; were connected by covered walkways about a square yard, walkways that were now walled-in with thick beams and stone. Doors and lower windows were boarded, secured and armed with long pikes thrust at angles into the ground before them, so that the whole became a mini-fortress whose only access was by the heavily defended upper windows. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Rhodka stood in the rear door of the building opposite biting his nails in his frustration and indecision. Through the windows he could make out a number of shapes milling about behind those stationed with bows and spears at the ready. How many more lay in the rooms beyond, waiting to take their places? </p>\r\n<p>He hawked and spat onto the blood stained threshold, his eyes never leaving the foe but his ears well aware of the heavy breathing and restless shuffling of his men behind him. Ordering the first row to stand watch and inform him of any movement, he turned and pushed through their ranks to go back inside, kicking angrily at the strewn bodies that got in his way. To simply storm the defences would be suicide. If they had more time, then no doubt a way could be found to penetrate with minimal casualties. He considered leaving a small force to lay siege and starve them out but his mind frowned on this, as both dangerous and unlikely to prove successful. Whatever these men had become, they were no longer human and if maiming and blood loss would not kill them he doubted they would pay much attention to anything as trivial as food. </p>\r\n<p>So too, the contents of the buildings worried him. The Courtrooms were bound to contain weaponry, so too the Money-house in all probability, in case of trouble. And who knew what secrets lurked within the Apothecary and Alchemist? What powders and potions might be stored there, that whatever possessed these men had the knowledge to use? But this aside, it went against all common sense and strategy to leave a pocket of so dangerous an enemy, walled and ready within their midst. If more of those things should arrive, his countrymen and their allies could find themselves in a reversed situation, with themselves surrounded and vulnerable. </p>\r\n<p>He stomped about the room, pulling at the red beard on his chin, tutting and muttering as he forced himself to accept the inevitable result of the decision he had come to. Telling himself that this was no normal battle and so could not be fought with the same normal set of values of honour and courage. That the rest of the fleet would arrive any time and the knights waited for and needed their presence in Talgheer. That to dally here would put them in great peril and may even effect the outcome of this war but to leave this foe intact could have almost as disastrous an impact. Over and over he argued with himself but still could not bring himself to give the order aloud, to make it fact. Like the Elfin... the Dwarven code was steeped in honour. This then, became his struggle, honour and ideals against necessity, revulsion and shame. </p>\r\n<p>Those around him kept a respectful distance from his private and troubled musings and a little farther from the unconscious swing of the axe that rolled with alarming looseness in his hand and seemed set to fly off into their midst at any moment. But of course it did not. Even in his absorption, the axe was an extension of his own hand and thus completely under his control. Finally, knowing he could put the moment off no longer, Rhodka ceased his pacing and cleaved his axe into the nearest table. The clean split of the two halves synonymous of his decisiveness of mind. He hitched up his baggy trousers, thrust the handle of his axe into the belt and, fists on hips, and turned to face his men.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll not make an order of this; since I too have struggled in the making of this decision and believe it must be a matter of conscience," he began, having called his men to attention and then outlined the dilemma to them. "What I intend to do therefore is to fire the entire area.&nbsp;I shall be the first to set the flame and I am calling now for volunteers to stand beside me."</p>\r\n<p>His words fell into a long, uncomfortable silence punctuated by the scuffing of boots upon the wooden flooring, the rasping of fingers through rough beards and the metallic plink of nails drumming softly on the edges of weapons. Rhodka held his head high and waited, keeping his gaze steady to all and revealing none of the shame or misgivings that ate at his own heart. ''What must be, must be'' he kept reminding himself. Only when those about began whispering amongst themselves did he speak again.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing will be thought or said against any, who either volunteer or do not. This I say and shall not repeat again. I fear this action may not be the first of its kind that we''ll be called upon to undertake that will be at odds with all that honour abhors. I believe also that without such actions we must be doomed to failure, for what we fight against has no honour and unless we steel ourselves to fight like for like, we may well find it is our own codes and not the enemy’s'' worth, that will defeat us. That''s all I have to say. Who will stand with me?"</p>\r\n<p>For a while he had the uneasy feeling he might have to go it alone but then, one by one, his countrymen raised their ''Ayes'' until the whole room had volunteered. Rhodka suddenly found himself overwhelmed, he had hoped for some but never imagined such unanimous support. He coughed, clearing his throat of the emotional gag that choked him but his voice retained the huskiness of his pride and gratitude, for their complete trust and loyalty towards him, beneath its briskness.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you. Now let''s get busy. You near the door find Sixth Kata Ulrak and convey the orders."</p>\r\n<p>The dwarf was already gone before his... ''Yes, Kata Rhodka''... fell into the room. Others followed him, to bring back wood for brands and makeshift spears, all the lamps they could find and cloth to soak the oil, while others built a small fire from which to light the torches. When they were ready they lined up in the street in rows of three. The first row held double shields to protect those behind. In the second row were those throwing and the third row carried the brands and spears. Rhodka’s first throw was the signal and the rest followed in their own time. </p>\r\n<p>Predictably, the first that entered the upper windows were hurled back out, along with volleys of arrows, but eventually the fire took hold, by which time the lower levels were already well aflame. Rhodka and his company watched grimly. Sick to their stomachs by what they had done, each and every dwarf privately hoped the same thing... that they would always feel so and never; no matter how many such unsavoury actions they were forced to take in the coming times; would they become accustomed to them. Then after a while their thoughts turned to a more unsettling nature. Though none relished the thought of hearing the gut-wrenching agonies of men consumed by flames, they did nonetheless expect to have to endure such torment and thus remained in the streets; considering it both their duty and some small measure of repentance for their deed, to listen and in their own conscience if not physically, suffer with those inside. But the expected cries were deafeningly silent. </p>\r\n<p>The dwarves knew the enemy were still locked inside, they could see the many burning shapes through windows blown out by the heat of the fire. They could hear the greedy licking of the flames, the crackling of spitting wood, the ''whoosh'' of cloth, curtains and soft furnishings as they caught light and the sound of breaking glass. They were startled by a sudden and violent explosion as the contents of the Apothecary and Alchemist lit the morning sky in a thunderous, blue-green cloud that sparked in a dazzling display of sprinkling yellow and red, before fizzling to the ground in a shower of grey ash. All this and more lifted over the constant roar of the fire but from the men inside, not one sound was heard. Not a single one tried to flee their fate. Neither, the dwarves realised, was there any heat from the now raging inferno. Nor did the fire pursue its natural inclination, though the wind was strong enough to send its questing sparks to fresh pastures and new life. It was as though some greedy, invisible force refused to give up one particle of what was its own, sucking everything back into itself. The dwarves glanced nervously at one another, growing more and more restless as they made signs to ward off evil and averted their eyes to the ground. Disturbed and unhappy, they began to file back into the building behind. </p>\r\n<p>Only Rhodka remained, his eyes mere slits as his troubled gaze fixed upon the burning square and watched the thick petticoats of smoke billowing out around the bright, orange flames. He did not want to stay, yet was held in macabre fascination by this strange entity. For it did seem to him something alive, as fires often do with their mesmerizing dance and wordless tongues that flickered vociferous warnings of the fine line between succour and suffering within the power of the flame. But it was not only the fire. There was another presence here. He knew it, he sensed it, and he could almost feel it reaching out to touch his dark and troubled mind with an icy hand &mdash; a presence that laughed in the face of its own destruction. That revelled in the pain and death of those it possessed. It’s only regret that it was over too soon. The fire was already beginning to die down. The smoke was thickening. Ash replacing sparks in the air. A heavy, cloudy pall of darkness, inside which lurid, grinning faces stared out. Rhodka blinked, telling himself it was only his unsettled imagination. But then, from the edges of the greyness, came spindling black plumes, twisting and weaving in and out &mdash; thin black threads on an unseen needle, sewing, pulling, reshaping the darkness into a flattened hand. Huge and menacing, its palm spread over the blackened scene. Slowly it moved downwards. Pressing upon the air below until the weight of it was too heavy for the charred timbers to withstand and they collapsed in upon themselves in an eruption of ash and soot. Overhead the malevolent presence continued to linger until the last piece of debris had settled back to the ground before dissipating in the bright rays of full morning. </p>\r\n<p>Rhodka rubbed at his eyes, scratched his bearded chin and swallowed as he pushed his disturbed emotions and misgivings, as best as he was able, into the deep recesses of his mind to dream of another time. Now was the time for practicalities and so he straightened his bloodied tunic and, calling for a guard around the burnt-out square, sent a runner for Burtak and Ulrak to see how they were faring and tell them to meet him back at the waterfront. </p>\r\n<p>Annuk greeted him as he turned the final corner, raising his axe in a victory salute. Rhodka looked at his animated face, devoid of its usual snide cynicism, with a surprise that swelled into wonder as Annuk suddenly broke into the first, genuine smile Rhodka had ever seen him utter. And as if that was not enough, to add to Rhodka’s already jarred nerves, Annuk strode forward and swung his arm about Rhodka’s shoulders as if they were lifelong friends rather than consistent antagonists.</p>\r\n<p>"You look done in Rhodka," observed Annuk with soft sympathy. "I''ve managed to rustle up some meat and ale over in the tavern. The others will find us there."</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka was too weary and emotionally bruised (not to mention totally taken aback by Annuk’s outrageous about-face) to argue and though he really had no stomach for meat, the ale sounded just the thing to take the sting out of his senses. He sighed with pleasure as the full-bodied froth slipped over the back of his ash-parched tongue and listened to Annuk’s report, much as his own experience with one twist. The strange creatures made no attempt to make a stand but instead ran off along the road and into the countryside. Annuk had deemed it wiser not to pursue, though some of the sailors who had joined them from the ships had given chase for a while but returned empty handed.</p>\r\n<p>"Better to live to defend, than die in an ambush," finished Annuk stoically and slammed his tankard on the table for a re-fill.</p>\r\n<p>It was Burtak that arrived with a fresh jug and slipped into the last vacant chair at the table of six Katas just as Rhodka was handing command of the port to Annuk. The Fourth Kata’s reversion to hostile suspicion was instantaneous and he demanded, with blatant sarcasm, to know Rhodka’s reasons for such a generous offer to leave him behind. It is difficult to say which of those present was the more surprised when Rhodka replied without hesitation.</p>\r\n<p>"Because there''s no-one whose skills to keep this port up and running and whose ability and courage to defend it, that I trust more."</p>\r\n<p>There was a long, stony pause while Annuk scowled suspiciously at Rhodka. His dark eyes began to glitter, humour lightening their deep solemnity.</p>\r\n<p>"By the Hammer! I believe you mean it,” he exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course I mean it," Rhodka snapped back, furious at Annuk’s laughter. "We might not have always seen eye to eye... "</p>\r\n<p>"Something of and understatement," Mawbek mumbled into his beard.</p>\r\n<p>"But you know ships and sailors better than anyone I know. You''re a true and loyal dwarf, when all''s said and done. You can give orders as well as fight. And I admire the quickness of your mind that might surely be needed here. Plus, there''s a certain irony to it that appeals to me. There... I''ve said it! Now do you want the job or no?"</p>\r\n<p>"Beards and Axes! This calls for a celebration. I may have wronged you all these years Rhodka," he slapped the First Kata soundly on the back and lifted his tankard. "To Battle. May it be the betterment of us!"</p>\r\n<p>"Beards, Bellies, Battle and Bedding! That''s what a Dwarf is born for,” cried a voice from across the room, rousing such a cheer that it drowned the last of Rhodka’s annoyance and he held out his hand to Annuk. Short legs pounding furiously across the wooden floor to the cry of ''make way'', turned all heads toward the door.</p>\r\n<p>"Kata Rhodka," said the runner breathlessly. "The fleet has been sighted. It signals to arrive with the dusk tide."</p>\r\n<p>"I want work parties stationed and ready," ordered Rhodka immediately, then shot an apologetic glance at Annuk as Mawbek gave a loud ''harrumph!''</p>\r\n<p>"Old habits die hard," quipped Annuk with a grin, grating his chair across the floor as he rose to get everyone’s'' attention. "You, you and you," his finger jumped about the room, "every lamp and lantern you can muster to the dockside. That group there... lines rigged across the front and the streets to hang them. The rest of you get that waterfront cleared and open those warehouses and stable yards. Jump to. We work all night. Those ships will be offloaded and back at anchor by dawn or you''ll answer to me!" The old Annuk was back in the threatening scowl that emptied the room, when he turned and winked at his companions before striding out himself.</p>\r\n<p>"Is it possible that he could really have change that much?" pondered Ulrak.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s possible," nodded Mawbek. "We''ve been in isolation on Katatuk far too long. Boredom is a bad thing for any Race but for a Dwarf it is untenable. We''re toilers and craftsmen, not philosophers. I believe it was a lack of stimulation and purpose that brought out the worst in Annuk and many others. We should have ventured out before. It''s a pity it''s taken such as war to make us realise it."</p>\r\n<p>"But war it is and that''s where our thoughts should be. Burtak. I need you to send Mirka to Frogs Wollow. Talgheer! What a place to choose. It must be the most defenceless city in Rohansuk. We''re going to need plenty of Zafchak if we''re going to be able to do anything useful."</p>\r\n<p>Zafchak was a soft, porous mineral found only in the Unclaimed Marches and known only to the dwarves and the miners of Frogs Wollow, that were paid handsomely for their labour and their silence. It was a unique and special mineral. Light to dig and transport, when it was fired it became a thick, black, tarry liquid that burnt hot and long. Yet it was not this alone that made it such a precious and desirable commodity. The dwarves had discovered, quite by accident, that mixed with water and at a certain temperature, it re-solidified into a third property... a shiny, resolute substance that was second only to the famed Henocite for its hardness. Burtak knew its value as well as any and informed Rhodka that he had already anticipated this need as soon as Davin had mentioned his plans for Talgheer. Thus Mirka had been dispatched days ago and returned with the miners’ assurance that there would be at least six wagonloads ready and waiting when the dwarves arrived.</p>\r\n<p>"Excellent. Take as many soldiers as you need and leave at once. You''ll travel a lot slower once you pick up the wagons, so we''ll probably catch you up by the time you pass the Hilldips. And be careful," Rhodka warned as Burtak nodded and rose from the table. "First sign of trouble send Mirka. We need that Zafchak."</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll have it," promised Burtak.</p>\r\n<p>As promised, Annuk had the ships off-loaded by dawn and, as promised, Rhodka caught up with Burtak (and the miners that had chosen to join him) just north of the Hilldips. They marched on until, to the east of them, the first knobbly knuckles of False Ridge poked through the flat landscape. They began the first lines of Talgheers'' defences here. At varying intervals over the many leagues still to Talgheer, they dug a series of interlocking ditches and pits. Some were long and shallow, filled with Zafchak and covered with dried grass. Some were deeper and filled with sharpened stakes and jagged rocks. Some were just deep enough to swallow the height of two tall men and into these they put a large number of marsh frogs (whose skin secreted a deadly poison) the miners brought along and snakes and other insects they felt would be very effective in the confined space of the pits. Several Tehgra were left in advance of the first ditch, to hold as long as they could and to light the Zafchak as they fell back. Those that had gone on to Talgheer began demolishing the inner walls of the outer buildings, using the brick and stonework to construction of joining walls between said buildings which were then coated with a layer of the liquid Zafchak and left to set into an almost impenetrable barrier. They built two more inner walls behind this, accessed by wooden ramps that could be set alight as and when necessary. They worked tirelessly from dawn to till dawn. In rotating shifts of work, eat and sleep that gained them the admiration and respect of the townspeople who, despite enthusiasm and determined effort, were unable to stand the relentless pace.</p>\r\n<p>And so it was that Davin and his company returned to a far different Talgheer than they had expected. Amazed, but strangely unsurprised, Davin congratulated Rhodka on the industry of the dwarves when he met with the Six Katas. He was alarmed and relieved to hear the news from Canest and disturbed that Tynan had yet to send word of events in Fellamund. Tynan had promised to come to Talgheer as soon as he had completed his task and he wondered anxiously what could have happened to so delay him. The fact that Talgheer had not received word of any kind from outside the city did nothing to relieve his anxiety and he was of two minds as to whether he should go himself and take a look around. Rhodka argued vehemently against this, saying that he had plenty of scouts watching the southern lines and the Westbrooke Pass was well-manned with lookouts that would raise the alarm soon enough if they saw anything. It was best that Davin remain here, Rhodka advised. While the men of Talgheer were grateful for all the dwarves help, when the trouble started they would look to one of their own for encouragement and orders. Davin was too important to risk unnecessarily. The only thing they could do now was wait. Reluctant as he was, Davin was forced to agree.</p>\r\n<p>And it was a good thing to, for the next day an envoy arrived from the Soyex Captains and refused to talk to any but Davin. The Captains, the envoy informed him, had weighed anchor as they had promised but had decided not to join him directly at Talgheer. Davin was furious but Mawbek cautioned him to hold his peace while the envoy explained further. The Soyex were Raiders, the Captains said &mdash; warriors of speed and cunning. They knew little to nothing about defending a city, of fighting a stagnant battle in places they could not move &mdash; even those Soyex that lived on land had wheels on their homes, Davin was reminded. The Captains had therefore decided that if they were to fight effectively for the knight, he must allow them to do so in the way they knew best and so, taking that his answer would be one of wisdom (that being that he would concede the Captains knew best) they had thus laid out their plan.</p>\r\n<p>The Soyex, having brought many horses, would move up from Canest and form a mobile front line to the south of False Ridge. They would engage the enemy, as they would with their ships, in chase, ambush, thrust and retreat, from all sides. They knew how best to use the night and the art of slipping upon the enemy unawares was their prowess. They would fight as they knew &mdash; unhindered and uncluttered. With speed and stealth. They would also take over the watch at the Dwarven ditches, since their long-legged horses could move much faster than the short ponies of their cousins and consequently, had sent all but a few of the dwarves back to Talgheer for new orders. They would of course, move to join Davin when they were no longer able to hold Duman’s forces back alone. By the time Davin received this envoy, the Captains would already be on their way in search of the enemy and would send word as soon as they were sighted. The envoy bowed to indicate the end of his speech and asked Davin if he would like to send a reply. </p>\r\n<p>Davin gave him a wry smile. His anger receding to amused admiration for the envoys'' cool demeanour throughout and especially his straight-faced offer to relay a response, since they were both well aware that the concise decisiveness of the Captains'' announcement had left absolutely nothing to argument in its complete and practical sense, or in its total autonomy of the commanding of their people.</p>\r\n<p>"Please return my respects and compliments to the Captains," he said, rising to his feet and offering his hand to the envoy. "Convey my congratulations at so expertly employing their Raiders to their full advantage and my thanks for bridging the gap in my knowledge and understanding of their expertise with their intrinsic wisdom. I wish them and you all, good luck."</p>\r\n<p>"I shall so convey your words. Sir Davin," the envoy gave a half bow. "My cousin dwarves. May the winds blow fair and the waves crest your bow. Fare thee well."</p>\r\n<p>The door closed behind him and Davin sat down on a sigh of weary resignation.</p>\r\n<p>"And that, gentlemen, is that! Let''s hope Duman’s forces find the indomitable Captains equally as overpowering."</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

Gradually, the generals began to drop their aggravating, effeminate posturing and bickering and revealed themselves to be quick-witted, cleverly thoughtful, decisive and surprisingly united. By the time the discussions had ended Tynan felt every confidence that, with the elfin and dwarves to guide them, they would work out just fine. He smiled at them all as he left, telling them he was happy to be able to report to the Regents at Symtar that the Fellisan army could be counted on.<p></p>\r\n<p>Now reduced to three, Tynan, Veskai and Eiyaris set a brisk pace back to Rohansuk. Veskai and Eiyaris, to rejoin their kinsmen and Tynan, eager to make his report to Symtar and then meet up with Davin in Talgheer. News also travelled quickly in Fellamund, they noted with satisfaction, passing wagons already being loaded with supplies and weapons and men on horseback and on foot responding to the call to arms and marching towards Marjasi. But as they came closer to the border, the scene began to change. The excited hum of preparation faded into a dismal hush of fear and dread. Busy bodies were replaced by dead bodies and bustling communities by vacant shells of burnt out rubble, as the goblin marauders spread further and deeper into the land and lives of the Fellis. Passing the razed homes, the burial mounds, the burnt crops and ravaged aftermath of devastated lives, their mood grew sombre, introspective, their thoughts centring on family and friends, on homelands, the safety of the future, or the lack of it, wondering why Fate had dealt the world so sorrowful a hand, or what strange twist of Chance had made Ecos choose Duman out of all the Mother’s children at his call. </p>\r\n<p>Were there truly higher beings that played the strings of mortal harps, or was it merely mortal weakness and desire?</p>\r\n<p>Was it Fate, Chance or merely mortal weakness that so distracted Eiyaris that he failed to notice the dip in the road into which his horse misplaced a hoof and which caused it to stumble and throw a shoe, resulting in their need for a blacksmith?</p>\r\n<p>Was it by Fate or Chance that the stone upon which Veskai sat down when they stopped to rest was marked with the direction to Sarong Wold, only a league away? </p>\r\n<p>Was it Fate or Chance or only equine necessity that caused him to mention it? </p>\r\n<p>Whose breath blew icy onto the Sarwater and rolled the dense, white fog southward, blinding the world so that travel was impossible and they were forced to take beds for the night? Was it fate, chance, or just unfortunate coincidence? Was it one or all of these... or was it something else?</p>\r\n<p>Whatever it was that played the tune of their day, it was most certainly the Black Hand of Bad Luck that guided the goblins to choose this night and this place to take their pleasures. </p>\r\n<p>Sarong Wold was by far the biggest dwelling place in this area, all the rest were small farms and mines with only a handful of prey. In Sarong Wold there were many. But it was a fair distance from their tunnel and had, thus far, been denied to them because of the Great Fathers'' orders to return by dawn each day. This day however, they were able to leave their tunnel well before dark. Slipping on the mantle of fog, they spread unseen onto the surface of the land and made directly for Sarong Wold, bursting upon the village whose bright glow pulsed like a beacon to guide them, with the eager passion of a hound that has at last sighted the fox. </p>\r\n<p>Tynan woke with a start. His soldiers'' sixth sense telling him that something was very wrong, even though all was, as yet, silent and still. Too still, he thought uneasily and pushed his feet into his boots and hurried out into the corridor. Eiyaris and Veskai were already there. Together they ran down the stairs and into the street. Inside the fog a soft drizzle fell over the village with a low, chilling hum that, though cushioned by the thick whiteness, still held a menacing persistence that made the blood run cold. Instinct drew their weapons, as they stood blindly, unable to see anything past each other’s faces.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" whispered Veskai.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know," Tynan shook his head. "But I don''t like the sound of it. Let''s get..." His sentence was cut off by the strident, baying howl of many throats.</p>\r\n<p>"That way," cried Eiyaris, pointing to his right.</p>\r\n<p>They groped their way cautiously (there was no point in running straight into trouble), treading deeper into the fog trying to follow the noise until the dead of night came alive with screams of pain, panic and incredulous horror. The sound of pounding feet was everywhere. Shapes loomed and faded before them but they dared not strike in case they turned out to be innocent villagers. Metal clashed on metal, on stone and wood. They could hear the ripping slurp of blade through flesh and the crunch of bones. Wailing terror cut short in choking silence. Men, women and children were crying out to each other, calling for help, pleading for mercy. Yelping dogs. Squawking hens. Grunts, snorts and screaming neighs of panicked livestock. Something lunged at them. Veskai raised his axe, stopping it only a hairsbreadth from slicing through the stomach of the fleeing man and child. Eyes wide with fear the child’s white face was near invisible in the fog, only the blackness of her hair gave her substance. The man was red with blood, sobbing gasps rasping from his heaving chest. Tears streamed down his face from horrified eyes that stared at them helplessly. Tynan pointed in what he hoped was the direction of safety. The man disappeared. The sounds grew louder: smashing wood, falling stone, the crackling of flames, and the cackle of laughter. The stench of death saturated the air, clogging their nostrils and coating their tongues, so that even the acrid smell of smoke was tasteless beneath it. Within the fog they could see the glowing orange of fire all around. They stood back-to-back, knowing they should not stay but not knowing which way to go. Despite their weapons and skills, each felt as helpless as a child. </p>\r\n<p>The cries of the villagers were less now. Muffled by the fog and the flames and the rough voices that shouted unintelligibly between the invisible enemy. To their left a great ''whoomph'' silenced all else for a heartbeat, as one of the dwellings collapsed in a heap of sparks and smoke that pushed a dark fist through the white night and swamped them in fits of choked coughing and streaming eyes. Veskai cursed and spat the ash from his mouth, squaring his legs and hefting his axe to a more comfortable fit in his hand. Eiyaris crouched low, his keen elfin eyes narrowed to slits of concentration as he tried vainly to penetrate the cloak of smoky fog. Of the three, Tynan felt the most useless, tormented by the knowledge that he had all the power of the Dragonmark at his disposal and was unable to use it. </p>\r\n<p>How could he destroy the enemy without knowing where the innocent were? </p>\r\n<p>At the moment, the fog held more chance of safety for them than his using the ''Mark''. All he could do was listen to the cries of the helpless and the dying. He wiped his eyes on his cuff. He would not stand idly by and do nothing! </p>\r\n<p>He began to edge forward, drawing the others with him. The whirling fog gave no warning sound as it shifted aside for the large, fast shape charging toward them. Eiyaris saw it first and cried out. There was no time to wonder from what gross origins this bog-eyed, snarl-toothed monster was spawned. Only time enough to see it was extremely well armed (weapons aside) and dangerous. Tynan lifted his blade. It whistled challengingly but found no opposition, finishing its arc clean and empty. He swung again, too slowly. Something heavy glanced across the side of his skull. The fog swam in kaleidoscopic waves as he fell to his knees. Leaning on his sword, he tried to push himself back up but the ground would not stay still long enough for him to get his balance. He heard Eiyaris'' voice from above his head shouting in Elfin and through the bloody haze of his vision saw the elfs'' legs passed in front of him. He heard the grunted effort in the force of Eiyari’s strike. He blinked, trying to clear the blood from his eyes. Saw Veskai rush forward to stand beside the elf, his axe cleaving downward. The attacker roared in pain but the open gash along its right arm seemed neither to hamper nor slow it. Rather, it incensed it further and it bared its teeth, snapping its jaws threateningly as its head jutted back and forth, all the while snarling and frothing like a rabid dog.</p>\r\n<p>Ignoring the nauseating dizziness and the throbbing pain of his skull, Tynan forced himself to his knees. Clenching his jaw, he forced the swaying world to be still and dragged himself upright but what use he might be was questionable, since this alone had taken all his strength and he did not even have enough left to pull the tip of his blade from the sodden ground, let alone use it. Still he felt of more use standing than lying. He let his sword drop and pulled his dagger instead, gripping it as tightly as he could to still his shaking hand. Ahead of him, a red blur closed and parted. He wiped the back of his hand across his eyes. </p>\r\n<p>Veskais'' axe whizzed past his nose, catching the spiked club of the goblin before it could fall on the knight. Tynan ducked, lurched forward and wedged his dagger between the goblins'' ribs. A huge hand grabbed him by the throat, throttling him slowly and then he was on his knees again gasping for air while the same hand now reached for Eiyaris, who had slipped behind and plunged his sword deep into the goblins'' back. The goblin caught the elf by the leg and dragged him around to meet the incoming swing of his club. But Tynan was still in the way and Eiyaris smashed into him, the knee of his free leg making contact with Tynan’s chest. With the last of his strength Tynan grabbed hold of Eiyaris and pulled down. The goblin lost his grip and the club missed. Tynan heard Eiyaris roll to one side but after that everything passed him by, in an echo of vague confusion between the flickered blinking of his eyelids. </p>\r\n<p>Veskai, fierce and brave, moved in and out of sight with Dwarven curses and flashing axe. Short, sturdy legs bunching, crouching, jumping... limping... dragging but still keeping him defiantly upright. Beside him was Eiyaris, his long legs moving him around the goblin, distracting it. Trying to drain its stamina with his agility and speed. Cutting and slicing with nimble grace but tiring... slowing. Both were defending their fallen comrade.</p>\r\n<p>And all the while, the monstrous figure of the enemy, bowed and weakened but always fighting, fighting, fighting. Repulsing their efforts. Refusing death. Until at last, it crashed face forward into the mud.</p>\r\n<p>Bloodied and worn, Veskai and Eiyaris bent to Tynan, helping him to his feet. Black stars twinkled in the white-orange night. The last thing he remembered before unconsciousness came to claim him was Veskais'' voice shouting at the elf to get Tynan ''out of here'' and then there was nothing but black silence.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan woke with the mother of all hangovers, wishing Davin would not let him drink so much. He tried to roll over, away from the punishing sunlight that stabbed through his closed eyelids but he could not move for the weight on his chest. Groaning, his forced his eyes open and reality asserted itself in the ashen, blood soaked figure of Eiyaris pressed upon him and he remembered. They lay flat against the remains of a wall, charred and smoking timbers all around. Tynan carefully rolled Eiyaris onto his back, then pulled him into a sitting position with the elf’s head cradled on his lap. Eiyaris was cold as death but he was alive... just. Tynan took his hands, chaffing the wrists and calling his name gently. The elf’s eyes fluttered open.</p>\r\n<p>"You... made it... I''m glad... Never did it... before... Didn''t... know if...hold it long... enough," he faltered hoarsely, his lips curving only slightly into a wan smile.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh! Don''t talk. Save your strength," murmured Tynan. "You can talk later, when you''re well."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re a bad... liar... Knight," he tried to laugh, but was overcome by a fit of bloody coughing.</p>\r\n<p>"So I''ve been told," replied Tynan as lightly as he was able, biting his lip to still his trembling chin. </p>\r\n<p>Eiyaris blinked slowly.</p>\r\n<p>"Veskai... dead... fought bravely... tell... kin... " </p>\r\n<p>"I will," said Tynan holding Eiyaris close as his eyes closed. Under his forearm, Tynan could feel the shallow movement of Eiyaris'' chest faltering. He waited with aching heart and tear-filled eyes for the inevitable. The elf’s'' hand rose shakily to his neck and his eyes flew open as frantic fingers plucked weakly at the cloth of his shirt. Tynan took the hand in his own and squeezed tightly.</p>\r\n<p>"My... Rùyi... Shœrè?" gasped Eiyaris, desperation lending strength to his voice.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan’s eyes darted quickly about and, spotting the medallion near the wall, reached over and picked it up.</p>\r\n<p>"Here! Eiyaris,” he cried, softly shaking the elf that had gone limp in his arms. "Eiyaris. I have it. Here, here it is," he pressed it into Eiyaris'' palm. The elf’s'' eyelids fluttered up weakly. "The chain had broken is all," Tynan told him.</p>\r\n<p>Eiyaris pushed it back at him.</p>\r\n<p>"I... en... trust... to... you... Give... my son... Please?" </p>\r\n<p>The urgent plea was so soft Tynan could barely hear the faint words, forced with ominously, lengthening pauses between rasping, painful breaths. Eiyaris'' fingers clenched tightly to Tynan’s arm as he hung on to the physical realm to hear the knights'' answer.</p>\r\n<p>"You have my word. Your son will have it," promised Tynan, nodding at the same time just in case Eiyaris had gone beyond hearing. "Thank... you... are... good... friend... Tyn..." </p>\r\n<p>The half-spoken name faded into the gentle sigh of the Eiyaris'' final breath.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan had seen many men die but he would never, for as long as he lived, forget the radiance with which Eiyaris relinquished his hold on mortality. The light of sheer bliss that brightened his almond eyes to glowing amber and softened the pain-ravaged features with such a peaceful contentment, pierced Tynan’s heart and spirit with bittersweet wonder. He hugged the elf’s'' body to his chest and wept, unashamedly, like a baby. He remained there for a while even after his tears were spent. Cradling the elf gently. Wiping the dirt and blood from the sculptured features and combing the matted hair with his fingertips. Then remembered the medallion, warm and sticky, still clenched in his left fist. He laid Eiyaris carefully to the earth and sat back, spitting onto the metal to clean the mud and muck from its carved surface. It was not the same as the one Cymon had given them. This one depicted two stags, horns clashing, beside a lake or river. And the writing on the back looked different, though of course he could not be certain of that since he did not speak Elfin. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly the full import of Eiyaris'' words hit him, as his memory flashed back to the first time he had met Cymon. Somehow, Eiyaris had used his gift to cloak them both, so that the enemy would pass them by. Eiyaris said he had not done it before. He meant that he did not know if he could cover another person. It must surely have taken every ounce of physical and mental strength Eiyaris had to achieve it. So much, that he had nothing left to withstand the wounds he had sustained. Wounds which, now that Tynan looked closely, should not otherwise have proved fatal.</p>\r\n<p>Nothing stirred in the blackened aftermath of the attack except a quiet breeze, the hesitant rays of the pale winter sunshine and the renewed, broken sobbing of Tynan, bent over the body of Eiyaris who had called him his friend and given his life to save his... yet whom he had barely known. And not just Eiyaris, he realised with humility as a glint of sunlight sparkled through his tears and he spied Veskais'' axe, laying lost and abandoned in a pool of churned up mud and grass. He got to his feet, picked up the axe and, using what little spittle he could muster, cleaned it on his trouser leg before going in search of the dwarfs'' body. He looked everywhere; leaving nothing unturned but could not find him. Only pieces of bodies that could be anyone, flesh ripped from the gnawed bone and discarded. Sick to the pit of his stomach he realised that these ''creatures'' were not only killing, but also eating their victims. </p>\r\n<p>The war, the future, his orders... his promise to Davin... even the one he had just made to Eiyaris... all paled beneath a personal, grim determination that somehow, someway he was going to find out where these things came from, and destroy them. For Eiyaris and Veskai and all the villagers of Sarong Wold... and for himself. But first he had to tend to Eiyaris. </p>\r\n<p>He knew nothing of Elfin rituals and so he buried the elf in the way knew. Laying him in a shallow grave with the elf’s'' sword and Veskais'' axe nestled in his arms. They had fought and died together and it seemed only fitting that all that remained of them both, rest together. As an afterthought he slipped his own dagger in with them, hoping they would know how much he loved them; that with Davin they were the brothers he never had; and how he was honoured to have fought by their side. Then he piled a high cairn of stone on top, to keep off scavengers and to mark the grave in case the Elfin or Dwarf wished to reclaim the remains later. He knelt beside and spoke a few words of sorrow and thanks for their sacrifice and an awkward prayer to the Mother for their safe journey to her arms, finishing with a quick apology for not having believed in her until his encounter with Ecos. </p>\r\n<p>It took him all afternoon, a great deal of frustration and a large dose of irritation but eventually his perseverance paid off. Along the southern edge of the ruins he found footprints. The grass had sprung up to conceal the pressed earth but the wet weather had left a soggy pool in the hollows. He placed a foot in one and was baffled to find it at least double the size. They had not appeared to be that tall. Fearsome, yes and long armed, but not that tall. The knock on his head had not distorted his memory that much. At his point, he remembered his own injuries and that brought back the thumping throb in his temple. He went back to where the inn had been, hardly expecting to find anything but miraculously his small bag of herbs and ointments had survived. He bathed his head, smeared it with ointment and popped a few herbs in his mouth to help dull the pain. He paused once more by the grave, spending a few moments to ponder why he had survived. Why his wounds, so incapacitating at the time, were nothing more than minor scratches whilst his companions had had to die. There was no answer, he knew &mdash; at least not one that his mind could fathom (despite all his years of trying) but he would find a reason for some purpose to it. And with this promise to his two sleeping friends, he set off. Not north to Symtar, or west to Talgheer. But south, to who knew where.</p>\r\n<p>He walked himself to the point of exhaustion all-day and slept all night in a deserted wolf den. Next morning he chewed some more herbs, drank a little water and set off again. The few lucky signs that had led him thus far became fewer and harder to find until there was only rock. The impenetrable Henocite, that was as rigid in its refusal to impart help as it was in its solidity.&nbsp;But as he stared at defeat, night fell and he was able to tell himself that he had merely missed something in the fading light and that tomorrow was another day. He found a small depression, partially hidden by a scrawny bush, at the base of a steep incline. He could barely squeeze himself in but with a few branches laid over him, he had some protection from the cold and wind. He managed to snatch a few moments of sleep here and there but on the whole, it was a cold, uncomfortable night and he was glad to see the sun. He eased himself from his hole and stretched the cramps from his sore muscles, stilled the protesting grumbling of his empty stomach with another handful of herbs and the last of his water, and renewed his search. </p>\r\n<p>The sun was at its zenith, preparing to give control of the skies to gathering dark clouds.</p>\r\n<p>As daylight dimmed and the first spots of rain spattered down on his uncovered head, Tynan finally dropped to the ground in defeat. He sat in the open, wet and miserable, and let the rain-wash away the last of his hope. The only way he was going to find those creatures was if he happened to run smack into the middle of them and then it would be too late for what he planned. He rolled up his sleeve and rubbed at the Dragonmark on his arm. </p>\r\n<p>"What''s the point of having you, when I can''t use you?" he asked aloud, staring at the tiny tail pulsing at his wrist. He placed his fingers over it, listening to the ''thrum thrum'' of his heart. There were two he knew whose pulse longer beat the hearts'' tune.</p>\r\n<p>“I''m glad you made it,” Eiyaris had said, “but for what...to sit here like a bedraggled cat and wallow in self-pitying failure? ”</p>\r\n<p>He turned his wrist over, raising his arm so that he and Dragon were eye to eye.</p>\r\n<p>"Can''t you do something?" He cried, unconsciously echoing the words of Surke in Katatuk. "Just to help me a little without my having to call on you &mdash; just a small sign. Is that too much to ask?"</p>\r\n<p>The sky rumbled and the storm opened its fury with jagged forks of lightening. Common sense at last prevailing, Tynan jumped his feet and ran for shelter. He sat huddled under a tiny overhang; his head on his knees, his boots sticking out into the rain and dozed the storm away. Suddenly he was wide-awake. A soft, scrabbling sound on the rock above brought him to alertness. As quietly as he could he drew his sword, laying it ready across his knees. The sound stopped then started again. Something was definitely coming down. He cursed his stiff muscles silently as he manoeuvred himself onto one knee, ready to spring. He tensed, heart pounding in his ears. The sound came nearer but no louder. He frowned. Something was not right. Whoever it was, was either very light on their feet or...? Tynan’s mouth began to twitch and then he was laughing aloud as a sleek, black rat sat down on its haunches and stared accusingly at the sword pointed in its direction. Tynan sheathed the sword and dropped onto his backside.</p>\r\n<p>"By the Mother but you gave me scare," he said quietly. "And what might you be doing way out here? Just visiting, what about you?" he squeaked a mocking reply and with a self-deprecatory grin, shuffled back under the overhang, chiding himself on his foolishness and feeling his forehead for signs of fever. It felt normal but took some herbs just in case. He dozed again and when he woke found the rat still there, watching him with an unnerving intensity that lured his thoughts to the impossible. </p>\r\n<p>Could it be, Tynan asked himself?&nbsp;Had the Dragon...? </p>\r\n<p>He frowned, scratched his head and ran his fingers through his hair, thinking, wondering if he was going mad. He chewed on the inside of his cheek, his lips pursing in and out with his wild thoughts. He wiped the sigh from his lips across his unshaven chin. </p>\r\n<p>''Who''s going to know?'' said a soft voice inside Tynan''s head. ''There''s no-one here but you...''</p>\r\n<p>"...To see me make a complete ass of myself," he finished the sentence aloud and he leant forward. "I''m desperate enough to try anything about now, my friend. So tell me, did someone send you here." </p>\r\n<p>To his complete astonishment (for he had not really thought that the rats'' appearance was anything more than a coincidence) the rat actually seemed to understand him. It gave a single squeak and ran up his leg to perch on the top of his knee. </p>\r\n<p>"Can you take me to where I want to go?" he asked, his pulse quickening with excitement as the rat squeaked again. "Now?"</p>\r\n<p>The rat looked up at the sky. The sun was in its lower quarter but it was not yet dark. The rat began cleaning its whiskers.</p>\r\n<p>"Too early, eh? Perhaps a bit more sleep wouldn''t come amiss. Wake me when its time."</p>\r\n<p>Crimson washed the western horizon but the rest of the land dozed in diamond darkness when Tynan opened his eyes to soft, ratty whispers in his ear. He slipped his pack over his head and, as silently as he could, followed the rat back up the incline and along a low ridge of spiked rocks, that disappeared under a thick carpet of boggy moss before rising again to end in a sheer drop. The rat crouched to the ground and Tynan followed his lead, sliding forward on his stomach to peer over the cliff edge. A silver band of moonlit water edged with pebble pearls ran passed below. The rat flicked the back of his hand with its tail, angling its head as though telling him to listen. Sure enough he began to pick up a faint grinding noise rather like that of a gristmill. He twisted his head, trying to pinpoint the direction of the sound and decided it was coming from directly below. He inched forward a little more and the grinding became clearly audible, along with the ''clop-clump'' of pebbles being knocked into one another. As he watched, the pebble-studded platform rose up to reveal a large opening that moments later was full of arms and legs as the goblins spilled out onto the river bank, breaking immediately into a flat jog and disappearing into the darkness. There must have been a hundred or more before the platform sunk back to earth and was lost.</p>\r\n<p>Quietly, Tynan eased himself back from the edge and sat slumped forward, dejection written in every line of his body. Well, he had found what he was looking for... for all the good it would do him.&nbsp;Once again he had failed the Elf and the Dwarf. He might as well admit it to himself and go home. What had he been thinking anyway, careering off on a one-way mission after he had already made a promise to Eiyaris?</p>\r\n<p>"This is exactly the sort of reason why Davin made Captain and you haven''t," he said vehemently. "Act first, think later." </p>\r\n<p>Which was of course, perfectly untrue. Tynan had turned down more than one Captaincy in his career rather than leave Davin’s side but none of that seemed to count for much in his gloomy frame of mind. He shivered. It was too cold to stay up on the exposed cliff top all night, he needed to find somewhere at least a little sheltered until daylight came and it was safe to travel again. Keeping low, he began to creep back the way they had come, shooing the rat ahead from under his feet until it refused to move at all. </p>\r\n<p>"Look," he said with controlled patience, having dropped to his knees. "Thanks for everything but unless you know another way in it''s all over and you can go home." </p>\r\n<p>The rat twitched its whiskers and turned its head, and then it looked back into Tynan’s eyes and with a soft squeak took off. It was almost out of sight before it looked back, squeaking again as if surprised that he was not following. Now laying truth to his previously untrue claim, without thinking, Tynan ran after it.</p>\r\n<p>The rat led him back to the cliff top, to where it bowed down into a rocky outcrop crossed through with the narrow track the goblins had taken up from the riverbank. The rat took the track down to the shore with a nerve-wracked Tynan behind, treading across pebbles that insisted in clicking and clacking with all the gusto of a trumpet, no matter how lightly or carefully he placed his feet. By the time they began climbing again, Tynan’s neck was aching from peering over his shoulder, being certain the whole time that the creatures below must surely hear their passing and descend upon them. However, they made it safely and into a small cave a short distance up river. The walls were covered with some kind of fungi, very similar to those Tynan had seen growing in the bark of trees but these had a luminous, silvery-green tinge and were hard to the touch. The light they gave was not bright but it was enough for Tynan to see that this had, at some time, been a very large cavern. He thought perhaps the mouth of an underground river that had once flowed into the Sarwater until something (most probably an earthquake) had caused part of the ceiling to collapse, damming the river and forcing it to find another exit. About halfway up the blockage the rat was sitting in front of an opening, waiting.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan scrambled after it, slipping and sliding on the loose shale. Resting a moment, he peered dubiously into the dark, dank hole below and then at the might of the earth above, held at bay by a thin (too thin it seemed to Tynan, who had never been one for enclosed spaces) slab caught crosswise in its descent between a rock and a hard place &mdash; an analogy that seemed to describe his present predicament perfectly. He swallowed nervously, wiping his sweaty palms down the front of his jerkin before finally pulling his pack over his head and, on a deep breath, sliding inside. </p>\r\n<p>Scant as it was, the guiding pink arrow of the rats'' tail ahead was comforting in the darkness, helping him focus his determination and thus retain control of the rising panic of his claustrophobia. A focus that had only just begun to be tested, he realised, as the tunnel began tapering so alarmingly that at one point he found himself wedged, one arm bent beneath his body. Wriggling wildly he tried to force himself through but that only made things worse and he found himself firmly entrenched with the double misery of having wrenched his shoulder in the process. His mind began to swim as he imagined being lost here forever. Suffocating slowly. Crushed, thinner than parchment, as the rocks above came crashing down. His head was buzzing and he felt sick from the hollow coldness in his chest and the uncontrolled shaking that chattered his teeth so they ached and seized his entire body with painful spasms of tense paralysis. He swallowed down the nausea, panting in short, sharp gasps of air that he exhaled with noisy deliberation as he willed himself into calmness and clear thinking. </p>\r\n<p>Feeling with his free hand he found a tiny lip, no thicker than his thumb, and traced it into his upper arm. Though he had felt no pain, he was obviously cut for his fingers came away warm and sticky. It seemed his frantic struggling had forced the shiver of rock into the flesh. A finger-full at a time, he pressed the torn flesh back around the obstruction and once he was free, pushed himself back to wider spot where he was able to move enough to rip the sleeve from his shirt and wrap it about the cut, tying it tightly to stem the bleeding. Then he rolled onto his back and began moving up the tunnel once more. </p>\r\n<p>With his shoulders now flat to the ground he was able to slip past the obstruction easily but he no longer had the reassuring pink tail of his rodent friend to keep him company and the sight of the whole world only a rumbling breath away from crumbling upon his frail flesh, was a tormenting burden to his straining sanity. Once again he smelt his own fear filtering up from his sweat-drenched body. He licked his lips. Even the salty taste of sweat was better than the dryness of the Mornay to his parched tongue. He tried closing his eyes but that only made the sense of weight press further upon him and his heart race even faster. He began to hum a soft tune, a drinking song that had made merry of many a gathering but it only tiptoed back to his ears in a haunting refrain that accentuated, rather than diminished, his complete and helpless solitude. So he grit his teeth and continued pushing in silence. </p>\r\n<p>He spent a lifetime in that place, or so it seemed, until at last he was born again into another cavern. His initial shout of relieved jubilation, at the sight of such a marvellous expanse of empty space above, was cut short as he realised the space below was also empty. Luckily, it turned out to be only a minor drop and he was able to steady himself with his hands, albeit awkwardly, and lower his back onto firm rock before his legs slid out after him. He rolled over and got to his feet. It seemed strange to be upright again after so long on his back and it took a few moments of unsteady swaying to settle his balance before he had a chance to look around.</p>\r\n<p>This cavern was much bigger than the one through which they had entered but was covered with the same luminescent fungi. Several crevices and passageways opened out from it &mdash; the lower ones trickling with water, from a small pool that overflowed from its constant unseen supply, which tippled down the far side from an oval gap high up near the ceiling. The sound of the water reminded Tynan’s stomach that it was empty and he hurried over, drinking his fill of the cool, crisp liquid to quieten the now noisy rumblings of his hunger as well as quench his raging thirst. He sat down to rest, a sudden weariness creeping in now that he no longer had to keep moving. The rat sat across the pool watching as Tynan’s eyelids winked tiredly and then closed; and listening as soft snoring mingled with the churning groans from the two-legs middle.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan woke abruptly. Cold and stiff, he rubbed the crick from his neck as he stood stamping his feet to warm his blood while his eyes scanned anxiously for the rat. Peering down from one of the openings just above his head, it waited patiently while he clambered up to join it. As they wormed and wiggled through more subterranean passages, Tynan noticed a change in the rock structure. The smooth, glossy confines of before gradually relinquished their dominance to a rough, pitted grittiness that became littered with rocks, loose stone and even soft earth. When Tynan found himself twisting around thick roots, he thought that they must surely be quite near the surface. Perversely, he found this thought more disturbing than the barren caverns of the depths. </p>\r\n<p>A second lifetime passed in this strange, underground world of eternal night but as long as the rat led, Tynan followed. They had turned into a high fissure that ran straight, but on a gentle, downward slope, and had followed it some ways when suddenly, the rat flattened itself against the ground. Tynan followed suit. He could feel the quivering tension running along the sides of the rats'' body, pressed against his arm, increase as the faint slap of feet against rock grew louder and a pale glow lit up the way ahead. Mumblings became discernable as separate, harsh, guttural voices. Voices he recognised from the village. Tynan held his breath as the light became brighter and he realised just how close they were to the intersection of the two tunnels. He could only hope that the creatures coming through the other tunnel kept going and did not happen to look his way. Shadows appeared first, then four, squat figures carrying bundles under their long arms. Tynan waited anxiously as they passed, thankful for their haste that prompted those behind to push the torch-bearing leader forward when he would have thrust the light into the concealing darkness of Tynan’s hiding place. After they had gone the rat clicked its teeth and skittered to the intersection. Tynan waited until it came back and nosed his outstretched hand before moving. </p>\r\n<p>The intersecting tunnel was wide. The walls obviously chiselled and shaped by tools, not by nature and the floor worn by the passage of many feet. A rush of excitement warmed Tynan’s chest. He had found what he wanted. He pulled his head back into the fissure and turned his face to the rat.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," he whispered softly. "Only one more question. Which way leads into their home?"</p>\r\n<p>The rat blinked once and then turned to stare down the right face of the tunnel. Tynan smiled. </p>\r\n<p>"Thank you again. Now, if you have any family down here, then get them as far away as you can, for I intend to destroy this place... or as much of it as possible. D''you understand? Good. Go. Go... go... go,” he shooed with his hands when the rat hesitated. Once it had disappeared out of sight up the fissure, Tynan stepped cautiously into the tunnel and hearing nothing, ran as lightly and as fast as he could.</p>\r\n<p>Escape holes were elusive but for a while at least, his luck held and it happened that there was one nearby each time he heard noises approaching, where he was able to hide until the goblins had passed. But such good fortune could not last forever and inevitably he found himself face to face with a group of goblins, coming out of some sort of chamber, just as he raced around a sharp bend. And yet luck had not entirely deserted him for these were only young children, who had followed the adults earlier and stopped to play a while before hunger called them home. So instead of ripping him to pieces, their first reaction was to gawp in surprise at the strange, ugly thing that had suddenly appeared from nowhere. In those few, precious moments that it took them to raise the alarm and for the sound of running feet to echo down the tunnel toward them, Tynan was able to pull up his sleeve and place the Dragonmark against the wall.</p>\r\n<p>"Mighty Earth, thy Power heave, to Dragonmark respond.</p>\r\n<p>Shift and quake thy massive frame through this place and beyond!"</p>\r\n<p>It began as a low growl. The aggravated grumbling of a sleepy bear disturbed from his winter slumber, as the ground began to shiver and then to tremble. All about, the sound of distant thunder increased and all about, the earth responded with violent shaking. Dust and rock clattered down the walls and thudded heavily about their heads and feet. In spite of their rigid upbringing, the goblin children began to scream. They had never experienced such movement in the ground before and they were scared and then frightened even more so by the strange, hitherto unknown emotion. </p>\r\n<p>Telling himself that children grow up into their parents, Tynan ignored the quick stab of guilt in his chest and broke into a lurching run, disappearing back around the bend just before the three adults arrived at the scene, rocking and weaving but managing to stay upright on their short legs and large feet. The terrified youngsters threw themselves upon them, unwittingly aiding Tynan’s escape, grabbing hold of adult arms and legs and hanging on for dear life as the thunderous roar of the quaking earth swelled and rolled and heaved and bucked, shaking from their memories all thoughts of the intruder... all they wanted were their mothers. The adults cursed and slapped the bawling children shouting angrily that goblins did not cry.</p>\r\n<p>"Ground not meant move either, but is,” the children protested between their sobs and screams, too petrified to remember that children did not ever speak to adults other than their mothers, let alone argue! </p>\r\n<p>The throbbing of their clubbed heads vied for dominance with the thunderous applause of the clapping rock being thrust together and thrown apart. Grating and cracking. Breaking into huge boulders and showers of rocky rain streaming down in their path. Ahead of their unsteady lumbering the shifting roof began to seep water from thin cracks splitting along the seams of rock. Again the Earth thrust upward, slicing the floor in two and dropping the nearside down so that the group of fleeing goblins suddenly found themselves stranded, facing a solid wall too high for them to scale and with no way back.&nbsp;With ominous eeriness, the violent quaking and the ear-shattering noise (that had been amplified by the long cavernous reaches) having continued all this time to rise, fell suddenly and frighteningly silent.</p>\r\n<p>All through the tunnel goblins everywhere joined in huddled waiting. Just when they thought it was all over, the air was sucked back along the tunnel, rushing passed them like a vast intake of breath that was held for a heartbeat... and then came bursting forth in a howling wind that tore a mighty chunk from the rock overhead and sent it crashing, on a lumbering, bouncing path over the edge of the rock wall and the heads of the small group and on down the tunnel. And in its wake came the thunderous roar of rushing water. Foaming white and muddy brown, it tore through the opening of its once-river-bed in ravaging fury, scouring everything in its path and dragging it mercilessly along on its quest for a new course. The small group were the first to go. The strength of the adults no match for the raging torrent of the angry river, even had they not been impeded by the struggling arms and legs of the children that dragged them under in their panic. </p>\r\n<p>Tynan, still racing to find a place of safety, was picking himself up for the umpteenth time when the tense silence was broken by the united bellow of terrified goblins echoing down the tunnel and immediately on its heels, the warning roar of the impending flood flashing towards him. He cast his eyes desperately for an escape route amongst the debris of the quake that made it even more impossible to try out-running the approaching water. As useless as that idea was, he would have rather done that than just stand and wait to be engulfed. He spotted a high mound of rock and began to climb, hoping that the water level was not too high and that, once in it, he could stay afloat and let the swell carry him to safety. Realistically, he knew the chances were slim to none but since he was going to get wet one way or another... he might as well get wet trying! </p>\r\n<p>He stood with his back to the approaching flood, taking deep breaths and holding the last one just before the water swept him off his feet. The swirling current dragged him down. He felt his thigh bang against something solid and bent his legs, kicking himself off it back to the surface. He had only enough time to drag in a lungful of air before he was sucked under again. Up and down he tossed. Bouncing from side to side on the surface. Bruised and battered upon the tunnel walls and the other debris carried along by the avenging river. Tynan knew his strength was going. His legs refused to kick anymore, his arms refused to paddle and stroke. His lungs were so waterlogged that he felt more like a fish than a man. He began to sink. Without the will or energy to fight. Memories from his life flashed through his mind and with a detached sense of wonder, realised he was dying. In a final moment of guilt he whispered silently to Eiyaris that he was sorry he would not be able to fulfil his promise but that perhaps his body would be washed into the Sarwater and somebody would find it and the Rûyi Sh''œrè and recognising it... send it home. With that hope, he slipped into darkness.</p>\r\n<p>The waters swelled. As they ebbed back into the main flow, Tynan’s body was cast adrift on the jutting ledge of a wide crack in the rock. The roaring of the subsiding waters faded. The plink-plink of water dripping from his limp, sodden body echoed through the tunnels.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

Keeping his horse between the guard and Sula, Roaban handed him his pass and told him to open the gate. The guard nodded to his companion who began to raise the heavy portcullis and then lifted the massive bar so that they could swing open the thick, wooden door. Outside, the horizon was lit with a pale orange glow.<p></p>\r\n<p>"I wonder what''s going on over there?" the guard muttered. </p>\r\n<p>Roaban pushed passed him, staring at the flickering skyline in horror before spinning on him contemptuously.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s Perrahove you fool! It''s ablaze." He lifted his gaze from the gawping guard to the lookout tower. "You up there. Are you sleeping? Can''t you see the fire, man? Raise the alarm!" </p>\r\n<p>There was no answer. Roaban stormed back through the gate and into the guardhouse, uncovering the lanterns and banging the call to arms on the drum. </p>\r\n<p>"What''s going on? Who are you?" demanded the sleepy-eyed captain as he stumbled out of his room.</p>\r\n<p>"Sir Roaban. Knight of the Dragon. Perrahove is ablaze and your watch isn''t answering. I suggest you send some men up to find out why and relay a message to the Order Regents. They''ll want to know about this immediately."</p>\r\n<p>"What,”&nbsp;exclaimed the captain, now wide awake, and spun furiously upon the group of knights crowding behind him. "You four, go and find out what''s happened to Fresal. If he''s fallen asleep I''ll have him in chains before this night is out. You six, to the Order House. Break the doors down if you have to but get the news to the Regents. The rest of you... do I have to do all your thinking for you? Up on the wall! Up on the wall!"</p>\r\n<p>Satisfied the captain had everything under control, Roaban returned to Velkaan and Sula.</p>\r\n<p>They had barely passed through the door swung when it shut behind them and was followed by the clanking chains of the portcullis being lowered. </p>\r\n<p>"Let''s go," he said to the others and nudged his horse into a canter.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re going to have to slow down," Velkaan’s voice called out him after a few strides. "Sula''s never ridden a horse by herself before. She needs a little practice walking first."</p>\r\n<p>"Well I hope she''s a quick learner because we don''t have forever," replied Roaban, doing his best to curb his impatience. Thankfully, Sula did prove to be a quick learner and by dawn they were striding out at a good pace and many leagues from the city. </p>\r\n<p>"So who and where, is this ''Lady Alyse''?" asked Velkaan later that day when they stopped to rest horses.</p>\r\n<p>"She is the one who recruited my captain and the rest of my company. She''s joined with the Dragon... don''t ask me how," he put in quickly as Velkaan gave him a bemused look. "And I don''t know where she is exactly. I''m... What are you doing?" Roaban interrupted himself as Velkaan broke a piece off his biscuit and began crumbling it onto the ground.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s for my friend here," Velkaan undid the buckle of his pack. "Then how do you know we''re going the right way?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m following the Dragonmark... and hoping. By the Mother,” exclaimed Roaban, shuffling backward.</p>\r\n<p>Darkpad paused halfway out of the pack and stared at the knight, whose revulsion was plain. It glanced up at Velkaan, its nose twitching. Velkaan laughed and picked it up.</p>\r\n<p>"Will you get that thing away from me," cried Roaban, pushing at Velkaan’s outstretched arm. "It''s probably carrying allsorts."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s as clean as you and me. I do believe you''re scared," teased Velkaan, lifting the rat closer to Roaban’s face.</p>\r\n<p>"I just don''t like them, that''s all," muttered Roaban.</p>\r\n<p>"He won''t hurt you, he''s my friend. Well, a friend of a friend actually. He''s called ''Rat''." </p>\r\n<p>"Very original. Now would you please put it somewhere else? You have some very strange friends," he added, glancing pointedly between the rat and the goblin. "Very strange."</p>\r\n<p>"The result of my misspent youth," quipped Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>"So... you''re a man already?" Roaban responded lightly, for the youth must have been at least ten years younger than himself. </p>\r\n<p>"Believe me... I''ve been a man for a lot longer than you have." There was no humour in Velkaan’s solemn tone. Roaban gazed at him curiously.</p>\r\n<p>"Ah! Now I''m intrigued. I sense a story here."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan shot to his feet. </p>\r\n<p>"Time we got moving isn''t it?" </p>\r\n<p>Roaban watched Velkaan re-pack his sack with angry, jerking thrusts and rubbed his chin thoughtfully, wondering what could have happened in the boys'' young life to make him clam up and withdraw so violently. Then he shrugged. It was none of his business and the boy was right, they should get going.</p>\r\n<p>An awkward silence prevailed amongst the trio for some time. Though Roaban and Sula both tried to engage Velkaan in conversation, he remained stubbornly unresponsive. Roaban gave up and nudged his horse slightly ahead to concentrate on the pull of the Dragonmark.</p>\r\n<p>He pulled up so quickly that the other two passed him and had to turn back. Throwing back his cloak he rolled up his sleeve, shivering as the cold air attacked his bare flesh. The colours of the Dragonmark were pulsing wildly. At once bright and muted, running into each other as if the tiny Dragon was mixed up... confused. Closing his eyes against the distracting images, Roaban tried to ''feel'' his way around them. A sudden rush of mixed emotions came and went. Joy, love, rejection, pain. Roaban had no idea what it all meant. Then, as unexpectedly as it had come... it disappeared and with it the fleeting but strong pull urging him southwest. And as it went Roaban was driven with an overwhelming sense of weariness that seemed born from the unknown loss. He slumped forward, clinging to his horses'' neck as the world spun dizzily.</p>\r\n<p>"Roaban? Are you alright?"</p>\r\n<p>"Just give me a moment," Roaban replied in a hoarse whisper, keeping his eyes closed and taking long, slow breaths until the ground stopped its spinning. He pushed himself back upright, pale lips grinning weakly within his pasty features. "I''m okay now."</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t look it," said Velkaan bluntly. "What happened?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not quite sure," admitted Roaban. "Except I felt a strong pull that way," and he pointed to his left, "but it''s gone now," his voice dropped to a distracted mumble.</p>\r\n<p>"Well it''s obviously still troubling you," Velkaan observed as Roaban’s attention drifted away with his gaze. "So let''s go and have a look."</p>\r\n<p>"Hmm? No." Roaban shook his head, as much to clear it as to respond to Velkaan’s suggestion. "My orders are to take you straight to the Lady Alyse."</p>\r\n<p>"You said yourself, you not exactly sure where she is. Maybe that had something to do with her? Even if it wasn''t and we don''t find anything, a day or two won''t take us that far out of our way. "</p>\r\n<p>"I must admit, I''m more than a little curious," wavered Roaban. </p>\r\n<p>The Regent would have his guts for garters but then again it might be something important.&nbsp;Sir Davin would surely go and check it out, he told himself and so, convinced by this, he nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"But just for a day or two, no longer," he stipulated firmly, more to himself than to Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>So, instead of continuing on their original course, the three companions turned and rode deeper into the trees of Storringay where, on the western edge, Gwym and Ammoel sat staring pensively at the semi-dead trees deep in their winter slumber.</p>\r\n<p>Gwym and Ammoel had left the plateau and skirted the northern border of the Mornay Desert towards Amrose, where they stopped to replenish their supplies. What they heard and saw there made them realise that the situation in Rohansuk had worsened considerably from the reports they had been receiving. Amrose was already beginning to fill with refugees, mostly women, children and old folk, fleeing their homes and livelihoods in Ansuk for a place of safety.</p>\r\n<p>It might have been the heart-wrenching sobs of these lost and frightened people, who had left sons, husbands, fathers and brothers behind to almost certain death. Loved ones prepared to struggle valiantly in the face of impossible odds. To fight with unfailing courage alongside the knights, to stem the flow of evil pushing inexorably onwards...&nbsp;It might have been the sight of their grief. Black-ringed, pain-hollowed eyes and haunted faces...</p>\r\n<p>It might have been the rising tide of panic that inevitably followed on the heels of the continuing stories of defeat after defeat, as the hordes of Duman spread like a lethal virus across the land...&nbsp;It might have been the terrible finality etched into their minds by their knowledge of Eona’s original vision... </p>\r\n<p>It might have been any or all of these combined, that filled Gwym and Ammoel with a growing sense of a brooding pessimism, contaminating and tainting everything from earth to air like a great, invisible sword hanging over the land. Swinging threateningly, ominously, tauntingly, back and forth on the slenderest of threads that the merest breath of wind might snap... sending the foretold doom crashing downwards. </p>\r\n<p>So the knowledge they held, hung over them with tormenting uncertainty. </p>\r\n<p>So the weight of the consequences of their success or failure, pressed down on them and they were consumed with a burning, almost obsessive urgency and determination to retrieve the parchment. An urgency that spurred them onwards without rest or respite until, at last, they stood before the trees of Storringay, in the northeastern corner of New Province. </p>\r\n<p>This thin swathe of woodland was the pathetic remnant of an ancient and glorious forest, planted, nurtured and harvested by the Dwarves with expert husbandry. But then the Dwarves had been driven out and the unique and exquisite, silver-veined wood had become fashionable amongst the ladies of the courts of Man. Fashionable, highly prized and desired beyond all reason and common-sense. A desire so blind and selfish, that it had almost led to the extinction of the forest. It seemed ironic then, that it should be here that their own burning desire should lead them. Where the extinction of Man (and all life) might be decided upon their finding a single youth amidst the maze of skeletal frames shrouded in cloaks of snow that towered over them. Against all odds Storringay had survived. Was this an omen for their’ own future? </p>\r\n<p>That despite all the evidence that they had thus seen and heard to the contrary, the Races would survive? They could only hope it would be so.</p>\r\n<p>At last, turning and nodding to each other, they nudged their horses forward and became </p>\r\n<p>trapped within the captivating spell of the haunting mood of the forest. The quiet ''whush'' of the horses’ hooves brushing through the soft, virginal snow intensified the cold, grave-like silence of the melancholic emptiness into which they had stepped. Not another sound marred the hypnotic stillness that was so deep and loud, it left both horse and rider with an unsettling guilt; as though they trespassed on sacred ground; and filled them with a profound reluctance to continue violating its intense serenity with their worldly intrusion. With every step they offered silent apology for their presence. </p>\r\n<p>They spoke only when necessary and then in hushed whispers, but even so their voices grated harsh and coarse in the silence. Even the musical notes of the elf rang discordantly within the uncanny feyness of the prevailing atmosphere, disharmonised with the delicate existence that made up this strange land that appeared as from child’s'' tale. A land muted beneath the sifting dust of sparkling snowflakes falling soundlessly, without haste or intention except to emphasise the impression that they were no longer within the world of dread and turmoil but had passed through to another place, one of peace and tranquillity. It seemed a land without time.</p>\r\n<p>They rode in this sense of timelessness, of being enclosed and covered in a blanket of isolated security, and the further they went, the deeper they sank into the sheer unreality of it, enamoured of the extraordinary purity of its beauty. Wandering aimlessly. Unwittingly allowing purpose and mission to be eased into forgetfulness, as the sands of Times'' displeasure mingled with the snowflakes to even the balance of the tampering of Fate. So deep were they beneath the illusion, that when Jarok appeared before them, silhouetted in such startling, stark-black contrast to the encompassing whiteness, their eyes could make no sense of it. Fear caught their throats and their first instinct was to freeze, lest they caught its attention. Hearts pounding, they stared at the apparition. </p>\r\n<p>Was this a demon, a spirit, a vengeful wraith come to wreak punishment for their intrusion? </p>\r\n<p>Was it real or merely another figment of their already over-activated imaginations? </p>\r\n<p>The firm humanity of his voice brought them back to reality where they exhaled the breath they had unconsciously been holding in gasps of relief. Jarok’s own relief was no less, even if it did not show. If he had not found them, who knows how long they may have wandered here? A small puff of wind blew softly across his ear.</p>\r\n<p>''Just for a day!'' murmured a stern voice, with a hint of amused satisfaction. ''Just for a day.'' </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s lips twisted wryly and he made a mental note to remember that Time would not be messed with lightly, before turning a bright smile upon the two men.</p>\r\n<p>"Forgive me," he apologised. "I didn''t mean to startle you. I was so pleased at having caught up with you, I just never thought not to barge straight in."</p>\r\n<p>"You appear to have us at a disadvantage," said Gwym. "You imply acquaintance though I don''t believe we have had the pleasure."</p>\r\n<p>"And you would be correct... at least in a physical sense," replied Jarok (which was not untrue since he had not met Gwym again since his re-birth) stepping closer to offer his hand. "But we have met on another plane. I am he whom the Sharran met at Symtar."</p>\r\n<p>"Then you are many leagues out of your way, are you not?" Ammoel'' tone was thick with sarcasm as he followed Gwym down off his horse and drew his sword.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps we were not to meet so soon... however, other matters have arisen and I thought to steal a little time."</p>\r\n<p>"What else might it be your intention to steal, I wonder?" asked Ammoel, taking charge of the conversation with his raised sword.</p>\r\n<p>"Poor choice of words," admitted Jarok ruefully. "Perhaps I should re-phrase myself and say ''gain'' a little time... or ''save''?"</p>\r\n<p>"What is said... is said," stated Ammoel, refusing to bend. "Who are you? What do you want?"</p>\r\n<p>"Who I am is not important," answered Jarok evasively. "And it is not what I want but what you will take me to."</p>\r\n<p>"And what might that be, pray?"</p>\r\n<p>"A parchment. A parchment you yourselves will receive from the youth you seek. A parchment that must not reach the Powerwielder."</p>\r\n<p>"And how might you know this?"</p>\r\n<p>"Because I too received a vision. But as I said, other things have happened that couldn''t wait and since I can''t be in two places at the same time... "</p>\r\n<p>"What are these ''things''?"</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t say."</p>\r\n<p>"Cannot... or will not." Ammoel was becoming increasingly suspicious at Jarok’s refusal to be forthcoming. "It doesn''t matter. Both imply you have something to hide. Such behaviour does not invite trust. You could be anyone."</p>\r\n<p>"No less of anyone than if I were to answer your questions," countered Jarok. "You were given no means to recognise me there other than my black apparel. Is my garb not black?" </p>\r\n<p>"You''re wrong." </p>\r\n<p>Gwyms blunt denial caused Jarok’s eyes to widen in surprise. The Sisters had told him nothing of this. Why would they withhold such a vital piece of information and what could it be?</p>\r\n<p>"It would appear that your vision was more detailed than mine," Jarok began, playing for time as he recounted what Hope had shown him and watching both their faces for any clues as to where the missing information might be hidden. He saw nothing in the silent, masked features of either gypsy or elf. </p>\r\n<p>"Is that the same as yours?" his questioning tone covered his dismay. </p>\r\n<p>"It is." </p>\r\n<p>Again the flat answer revealed nothing. A gnawing anxiety began chewing at Jarok’s stomach. </p>\r\n<p>What in the Mother’s name could it be? </p>\r\n<p>The information was identical... nothing different... Gwym had affirmed this. </p>\r\n<p>Then what was it and why all the secrecy? </p>\r\n<p>What did Eona know that he didn''t and why... " </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly he burst out laughing. Oh, the child was clever! </p>\r\n<p>But then that meant she knew who he was. How? </p>\r\n<p>The Grandmother. She must have known, that''s why she had sacrificed Tielan to save him,</p>\r\n<p>and had passed her knowledge onto Eona. </p>\r\n<p>But how did the Grandmother know? </p>\r\n<p>And more to the point, the angry thought sobered his humour, why didn''t he know, they knew? </p>\r\n<p>He was going to have words with the Powers that Ruled when this was all over! </p>\r\n<p>He laughed again, chasing away the dark scowl that had fallen over his brow. One thing at a time, he told himself and re-focused on Gwym and Ammoel, who were by now staring at him in bewildered concern. No doubt wondering about his sanity, he thought wryly.</p>\r\n<p>"Your caution is wise," he said, inclining his head slightly. "And your daughters'' wisdom far exceeds her years. Eona it seems has both a penchant and the skill for secrecy. Though," his lips curved in a rueful grin, "this time it might well have been our undoing. Thank the Mother that I am as Eona perceived me to be!"</p>\r\n<p>There was a long pause before Gwym answered. So long that Jarok began to wonder if he had guessed correctly but at last Gwym smiled.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re right on both counts. This was how I was to recognise you and yes, my daughter certainly does have a way with secrets." Again he paused, his tone rich in ironic curiosity as he gazed deep into Jarok’s eyes and added, "But perhaps some secrets are best left alone. You may put up your sword Ammoel. He is who he claims to be."</p>\r\n<p>"Are you sure?" the elfs'' eyes remained narrowed and suspicious. "It might simply have been a lucky guess. Or perhaps Duman has spies even amongst the gypsy camps."</p>\r\n<p>"Are all Elfin so obstructively disagreeable... or is this just a personal thing?" asked Jarok, his mocking tone losing nothing within the musical lilt of the elfin tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"You seem remarkably learned." Ammoel raised an eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s eyes danced as he sang the words to Parlens'' ditty.</p>\r\n<p>"Whatever else he may appear... an elf is an elf to the knowing ear!"</p>\r\n<p>"Actually, I was referring to your knowledge of my language," replied Ammoel dryly,</p>\r\n<p>allowing his cloak of illusion to melt away from his body, "for you''re clearly not of my Race yourself."</p>\r\n<p>"I have knowledge of many things," said Jarok evasively. For a long moment the two </p>\r\n<p>remained locked in silent searching until Ammoel held out his hand. </p>\r\n<p>"So it would seem," he grinned. "It is fortunate then, that you are on our side."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m glad that''s settled at last," Jarok tapped Ammoel’s sword. "Now, shall we go find this parchment?" </p>\r\n<p>Sula had seen the three coming long before Jarok’s hail reached the camp. A young man </p>\r\n<p>clothed all in black. An older man who suffered some strange affliction of the ears, which she guessed were the reason for the troubled lining of his brow and the anxious slant of his eyes. The third, she hesitated on a fearful note, looked like the Great Father. </p>\r\n<p>"He cum kill Sla,” she grabbed Velkaan’s hand. </p>\r\n<p>He squeezed it reassuringly, shaking his head as he explained that Duman was unable to leave the fortress (he hoped Kretos was right about that!) and that this one was another of his race who only looked like him... just as she looked like other goblins. Sula nodded that she understood but she did not release Velkaan’s hand and rocked nervously on the balls of her feet as Roaban called out for the three to enter the camp.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok appeared first, a broad, friendly smile tilting his eyes, that did not so much as flicker as they passed over the strange sight of Sula. Gwym and Ammoel however, were not so able to hide their shock as they saw her. Their expressions brought an immediate glare of protective distrust from Velkaan as his free hand slid to the hilt of his sword. Jarok quickly stepped between them, his soft, apologetic tone falling in a gentle balm over the suddenly volatile atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>"Please forgive our impoliteness for staring at your companion, she is the first of her kind that we have encountered. We mean no disrespect or offence." </p>\r\n<p>"It''s not you that should be doing the apologising," retorted Velkaan, moving slightly to stare at the others over Jarok’s shoulder and then snapping his eyes back in surprise. "How did you know she was female?"</p>\r\n<p>"Is it not obvious in the gentle manner of her eyes?" he replied, his hand cupping the side of Sula’s face as a father would a favourite daughter. So this is what Duman has been up to all these years, he thought to himself. How many... </p>\r\n<p>"Not particularly,” Velkaan slapped Jarok’s hand away, a stab of jealous guilt, that this stranger should immediately perceive what he had not, staining his words with a sharp anger. "Who are you and what do you want?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok sighed softly, pointing to the fire.</p>\r\n<p>"May we?"</p>\r\n<p>Roaban nodded and they all sat watching each other warily. Reaching out to warm his hands on the flames, Jarok introduced himself only as a... ''friend of the Powerwielder''... and told of their reason and purpose in being there. Gwym and Ammoel took a back seat, content to allow him to do all the explaining and contributing only occasionally to the tale, since he knew more about them than they knew about him. Roaban and Velkaan listened quietly, saying nothing. When he was done they excused themselves to talk privately and moved into the shadows where they could keep their eyes on the strangers but not be seen themselves. </p>\r\n<p>Could it be that this was the reason behind the strange occurrence of yesterday? </p>\r\n<p>Were they supposed, as these strangers said, to meet them here? </p>\r\n<p>Roaban was swayed by the fact that the Dragonmark had not reacted in any way to warn or alarm him that they were not that they purported to be and also by the presence of the elf, which the Powerwielder had promised to send. </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan, on the other hand, cared nothing for either of these, influenced rather by their claim to have been sent by the gypsy Sharran. Being half Soyex and having been raised filled with the customs and values of this race by his father (and also having travelled with gypsy bands on occasion), Velkaan had a deep respect and awe for what was the equivalent of the Soyex Xaushoi. If such had really sent these people then they should follow this Sharran’s request and pass over the parchment. </p>\r\n<p>However, neither were swayed enough to react foolhardily. Roaban was a trained knight and his time serving under Sir Davin (renowned as one of, if not the best) had not been wasted. Whereas Velkaan had been taught well by the school of survival and had not lived so long (for all his youth) by acting rashly. They were both very aware that the enemy was clever and cunning &mdash; a master of deceit and very, very dangerous. They had not received any vision or premonition that they could fall back on for guidance. All they had was the strange event of yesterday and their own judgement and intuition. Roaban rubbed his chin, his fingers rasping against the stiff stubble of growth. Indecision clouded the wary eyes beneath his heavily creased brow.</p>\r\n<p>"What d''you think?" he asked Velkaan, whose own eyes were narrowed upon those in the firelight watching the easy manner quickly developing between Sula and Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"The one in black is the mystery. The other two I''m certain, are exactly who they say they are. Did you notice he cleverly avoided giving his name? Why? What''s he hiding? Something, that''s for sure." He kicked at the snow (as if he might find the answers buried there) muttering heavily. Never before had he been so unable to read a man and it unbalanced and unnerved him more than he cared to admit. "What''s he up to? Why all the secrecy?"</p>\r\n<p>"It doesn''t necessarily have to be anything sinister," observed Roaban. "We all have secrets after all."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan’s head snapped around. The blunt inference that his own reticence to talk about himself bordered on the lines of secrecy was plainly evident in both Roaban’s words and his raised eyebrow. Anger flashed, quickly doused as he admitted the truth of the knights'' statement. A self-deprecatory grin pulled at the corner of his mouth.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s true. And perhaps his actions are reasonable, considering everything. What we don''t know, we can''t tell... no matter how forcefully anyone asked. Sula certainly seems to have accepted him and her judgement hasn''t been off yet."</p>\r\n<p>"It does seem pointless for Duman to be sending anyone after the parchment. Let''s face it, if he knows about it then he knows what''s on it by now too and what would he want with a map of his own place? Why bother trying to acquire it? His only desire would be to destroy it before it could be used. In which case the easiest and most sensible thing would simply be to kill us and dispose of it. There''s no tactical logic in attempting all this deceit. Still, we need to be sure."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan heard nothing after Roaban’s second sentence, which struck him in the face like a pail of cold water and he shivered as sickening images of how the wizard might have gone about extracting the information about the map from Kretos, welled up in his mind. He shook his head to clear them away, refusing to even consider this might be true. Kretos deserved more than that. Strange, he laughed to himself, he had spent more than half his life alone and friendless and now, when he finally made some, one was a half-rat, one was a full-rat and the other was... whatever she was! What does that make me, he wondered and laughed again? Suddenly he had an idea. Kretos had made a point of telling him that his family was everywhere. If that were so then surely one of them would have seen this mysterious stranger before now. If this stranger had anything to do with Duman it was possible he had been in the fortress, perhaps the rat would know. </p>\r\n<p>"There may be a way," suggested Velkaan and dropping to the ground gave a faint, high-pitched squeak. Darkpad could not have been far away for he appeared almost immediately.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ve got to be jesting,” exclaimed Roaban in disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh,” hissed Velkaan and began giving Darkpad a short explanation of their dilemma. "We have to know if he''s working with Duman, if he''s been seen in Ak''thai, or whether he''s genuine," he finished. </p>\r\n<p>Darkpad sat back on his haunches, pulling his whiskers and rubbing his tongue-dampened paws up the sides of his face and over his ears. Satisfactorily washed, he hopped into Velkaan’s hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Come on," Velkaan threw over his shoulder to a dazed Roaban, who could not believe he was actually going along with this nonsense as he ran to catch up.</p>\r\n<p>The others looked across expectantly as they entered the light and sat down. A tense silence settled over the camp as Velkaan studied them all carefully. Gwym waited, years of attending his Grandmother teaching him patience. Ammoel, his feelings hidden behind his proud, elfin mask, was given away in his anxiousness by the unconscious tapping of his fingertips against his leg. Jarok’s face was a study of innocence and yet Velkaan had the uncomfortable feeling that the stranger knew exactly what he was going to do. He quashed the desire to wriggle in his seat and leant forward, resting his arms on his knees instead.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ve talked it over, but before we decide there''s someone else that needs to make up their mind."</p>\r\n<p>"Is he here?" asked Jarok, swivelling his head around as though looking for someone to appear from the shadows. Gwym and Ammoel shared a glance of bewilderment. There had been none other in Eona’s vision.</p>\r\n<p>"He is," answered Velkaan and lifting Darkpad from his pocket, loosed him onto the ground. As expected, Gwym and Ammoel recoiled in disgust but to his surprise, Jarok merely glanced at him with light amusement and laid the back of his hand on the ground. Darkpad sniffed cautiously at the fingers then gazed up into Jarok’s welcoming eyes before jumping lightly into his palm to be raised to face level. </p>\r\n<p>"Greetings, little one," Jarok softly stroked the top of Darkpad’s head with a finger. "And what do you make of me, I wonder. Am I friend or foe?"</p>\r\n<p>Darkpad inched forward along Jarok’s wrist, so close that their noses were almost touching and Jarok’s soft breath washed over him like a warm breeze. Black, beady eyes stared unblinking into rich brown as deep as the earth, as welcoming as a safe hole in times of trouble and as loving as a Mother’s gentle, wet tongue on the tender, pink body of her new-born. Darkpad began to tremble. Faint ripples lifting his fur in wondrous excitement and he lay down in submissive adoration as Jarok allowed the power of the Mother to flow along his arm. Jarok wrinkled his nose, emitting the faintest series of squeaks that were unintelligible to any other ear, warning Darkpad he was not to return to Ak''thai, nor was he to tell any other of this happening. To the onlookers Darkpad appeared to yawn, as though bored by the whole thing, as he voiced his obedience. Darkpad turned his head to Velkaan and blinked once before stretching out in Jarok’s palm. Jarok continued to stroke him as he lifted his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Have I passed?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan looked at Roaban who, totally unable to see what the sight of a sleeping rat could possibly prove about anything, shrugged the decision back to the youth. Someone had to make it, he told himself, and otherwise they could sit here forever. And it was Velkaan’s rat and his parchment, so to speak, so it was only fair he had the final say. </p>\r\n<p>''Roaban,'' mocked a soft, inner voice that sounded very like his old squire master, ''that is possibly the most pathetic excuse for an excuse, that I have ever heard!'' </p>\r\n<p>Flushing guiltily, the knight glanced quickly about the fire in case anyone else had heard it but no one was looking in his direction. All eyes were upon Velkaan who, after only the slightest hesitation, to glance again at the somnolent rat, handed the parchment over to Jarok. Like a sigh of relief, a fresh breath of wind blew through the camp, fanning the flames of the campfire so that they jumped and crackled, showering those huddled around them with dancing, amber sparks. Jarok opened the parchment and stared long and hard at its contents, turning it over and doing the same again before looking across to Roaban who, like the others, was watching him with avid curiosity.</p>\r\n<p>"Do the Regents know what''s written here? The strength at Duman’s command?" he asked. His tone, like his face, was hard and accusatory in the intensity of his anger given the state of the land and its people. Roaban affirmed the Regents were aware but were powerless to act upon it openly due to the witless pride of the King. He went on to relate the resulting, unchallenged advance of Duman’s forces as far as Perrahove, his voice faltering as he neared the end of his report in the face of the advancing fury that whitened Jarok’s lips and raced, trembling, through his shoulders down to his shaking hands. Roaban swallowed. The flashing eyes and fiery features were reminiscent of the Lady Alyse, moments before Ecos had emerged to whip the Knights Company with his contempt. Roaban could feel the sweat dripping down his cheeks, despite the coldness of the night, and the shaking of his own body until, to his immense relief, Jarok removed his gaze and directed it skyward. Five pairs of eyes darted back and forth around the fire. No one spoke, for even if they had dared interrupt his thoughts none knew what to say. </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan carefully reached over and removed the sleeping rat from Jarok’s palm and placed him in his pack. Then he sat back and, looking at rustling parchment, wondered how Kretos was faring in his perilous charade as Duman’s minion. </p>\r\n<p>Triggered by Jarok’s reaction, Roaban found himself lost in the memories of that terrifying yet wondrous night when Ecos had appeared and, after the initial scathing, bestowed upon them all the Dragonmarks and sworn them as Knights of the Dragon. </p>\r\n<p>Ammoel watched Jarok with intensive concentration, as if by doing so he might discover what lay beneath the exterior. He was puzzled by the way the stranger had taken the Kings'' ineptitude almost as a personal affront. Even more, he was puzzled by the way something within the emotional state of this stranger called to the very core of his being. The Rùyi Sh''œrè concealed about his neck was growing hot and his fingers rose unconsciously to grasp it through his shirt as he forced his racing questions into quiet meditation. </p>\r\n<p>Gwym poked about the flames with a stick wanting only, now that their task was all but completed, to get back to the plateau and his daughter. </p>\r\n<p>Sula was simply bored. She had understood very little of what was said, since they had spoken too fast most of the time and with vocal and physical nuances she was unable to grasp. Besides she was hungry. When were they going to eat?</p>\r\n<p>Breathing his burning anger into the sky, to cool amongst the vastness of the myriad, twinkling stars, Jarok dampened the ferocity of his fathers'' Power beneath the soothing balm of his Mother’s wisdom. Now was not the time. The rumbling of Sula’s stomach quelled the remaining heat of his ire. Leaving the glistening heavens his eyes dropped to the goblin. She was almost drooling in her desperate longing for the contents of the bubbling pot hanging over the fire. </p>\r\n<p>"So what will you do with it now... the parchment?" Velkaan asked when a more relaxed Jarok smiled apologetically around the group.</p>\r\n<p>"This,” he replied, so quietly they barely heard as he screwed the parchment into a ball and threw it upon the fire. </p>\r\n<p>Greedy flames wrapped themselves around it, devouring it with sensuous, licking tongues that spat out red and blue sparks mixed with shrivelled, black pieces of parchment that drifted down in the smoky-grey finality of fine ash. </p>\r\n<p>The Earth seemed to shudder, as from out of the realms of eerie coincidence a lone wolf chose that precise moment to raise its wailing howl to the moon... an lingering echo to the shocked gasps of Jarok’s audience.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 25, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

At last the soft, rhythmic breathing from beneath the blankets spread beside the fire told him the others were asleep. He got up and trod silently through the undressed trees. Towering figures with bony arms stretched full to maintain the balance of black and white starkness, separating the night sky from the snow covered earth. The air was crisp and tart and his breath hung white before his face. The soft ''crumph'' of the snow beneath his boot was the only sound as his mind slid back to other nights like this in the forest by the cottage. <p></p>\r\n<p>If he closed his mind to the newness of his life, he could picture himself back there. Innocent and carefree, a boy with nothing more on his mind but finding... ''treasures''... to add to his collection. Soon Alyse would be calling. She would pretend to be angry because he had stayed out passed suppertime but she would ruffle his hair and fill his plate and listen patiently to his day. He breathed deeply but there was no smell of smoke from the chimney. No tantalising whiffs from the kitchen. </p>\r\n<p>''Phumph'' </p>\r\n<p>Snow dropped off the branches and landed by his feet. He stopped and looked back over his shoulder. The camp was no longer in view but he went a few more paces to where a large, exposed root bowed up from the ground and would conceal him from casual eyes. Scraping the snow away from the ground he lay face down. The ice-hardened earth yielded like soft butter to the pressure of his fingertips and he slid his hands beneath the surface. Then, keeping his Fathers'' nature tightly sealed to hide his presence from Alyse, any Dragonmarks trying to find their way home to her and, of course, from Duman, he lowered his consciousness into the realm of the Mother’s awareness. </p>\r\n<p>The knowledge of generations of Creation opened up to him in the voices of her children. The trees, the mountains, the rocks, the grasses, the animals, birds, fish, insects, all these were the eyes and ears of the Mother &mdash; especially the trees, the Guardians of Creation. Their stories and experiences constantly travelled from one to the other across the vast distances. Through the air, across the land and under the mighty waters of the seas, to the ears of First Oak... who had sprouted the acorns from which all things came and through her, to the Mother... who had been the First of All. None but these two knew the secrets of the each and every silent language &mdash; these two... and Jarok. </p>\r\n<p>Motherschild and Dragonspawn. </p>\r\n<p>With the Power of the Mother, Jarok wandered through the multitude of voices, discerned the desired from the ancient mumblings and separated them. Then he listened to those that spoke of this time. He listened as they recounted tales of death and destruction, of battles and slaughter as the confrontation between the Races and Duman’s forces began in earnest, of the decimation of the children of the Earth, the laying waste of land and pollution of rivers, of a land torn apart &mdash; half, a blackened, charred emptiness... the rest, a panic-ridden exodus of fleeing feet, paws and hooves. And beneath the voices, he heard the underlying confusion, the anger, bitterness and sense of betrayal. </p>\r\n<p>Why did the Mother not rid them of the infection that corrupted and killed? She had the Power to do so: to wipe them from the face of the Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Why did she wait? </p>\r\n<p>Why had she abandoned them? </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s heart wept as he felt the pain and torment of these, his children by the Mother and by the Power that was his Father. He wanted to answer, to give reassurance but he dared not speak lest Alyse detect it and know he was alive, and through her... Duman. Only from the trees did he detect a sense of understanding, for only they possessed the knowledge and reason, (equal in their youth and superior in their ageing) of the children of the Races, and so, he tuned his mind to them for a while, to ease his own pain and frustration. Their voices were low and sleepy with winter cold yet even in their somnolent state they kept their sentinel vigils. Listening to all. Watching all. And it was through these sleepy voices that he heard the despairing plea of Tynan. </p>\r\n<p>In his minds eye the image of Tynan rose, bold and true, and even though he knew it was great risk he determined not to abandon him. His breath eased from his lungs and his body sagged limp upon the ground as he merged with the great awareness of which he had previously been only a bystander. He travelled swiftly along the thoughts and essences of the earth into the very rock upon which Tynan sat and from there reached out for a presence that would serve his means. And of all that dwelt there he found those with minds open to receive and aid, minds with a clarity and depth far beyond that with which they had originally been created &mdash; </p>\r\n<p>Minds equal to the Races. </p>\r\n<p>He took a moment to marvel at the limits to which they had exceeded their expectancy and another to wonder if his Mother knew of their depths and then he was moving in search of the closest of their number.</p>\r\n<p>Just as he did every day, the rat scurried the length of the goblin tunnel in search for discarded and dropped morsels. When he found a tasty piece he carried into the safety of the cracks and crevices of the rocks, then sat down to wash before eating. The air about him grew warm, filling him with unease. He paused in his washing and looked up and about him, tense and alert for danger. He could hear nothing but just to make sure, he crept to the opening and peered cautiously down both sides of the tunnel. There was nothing there. He scampered back to his dinner and resumed his ablutions. Again he felt the air grow warm, stirring his silky fur and sending shivers of alarmed excitement through his whiskers. He crouched low to the ground and kept still, his back legs bunched ready to flee, while his eyes darted back and forth in the darkness. The rock in front of him began to shimmer like moonlit water, not silvery but blood red, and then it began to melt. The rat backed away fearfully, as a pair of molten eyes were shaped into the rock and transfixed him with awe. He stood still and touched his chin to the ground as he realised himself to be in the presence of the Mother of all. The glowing eyes called to him and he fell into their dazzling gaze and heard their silent instructions. He scurried off immediately to do Her bidding. </p>\r\n<p>Satisfied by the rats'' instant understanding and obedience, Jarok returned quickly to his body.&nbsp;He pulled his fingers from the ground and opened his eyes. He started in surprise to see Sula sitting nearby. How had she come upon him so silently?</p>\r\n<p>"Not mean make angry," she hurried to apologise, mistaking his puzzled frown for anger.</p>\r\n<p>"Sla want ask talk. Think best she wait... watch. Not know what cum when look in ground... not see. Sla know you diffrent... talk Pokut. Not say. Not say this also. Sla good... not say?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, thank you," Jarok smiled.</p>\r\n<p>"Not thank," she shook her head. "Sla like. You not stare Sla first see. Not see nasty. See Sla. Only Vlkan do like-same. Sla do all for Vlkan. Do like-same you. Others see Sla later. Is good, make happy." Her eyes clouded over and her face was filled with troubles sadness. "Sla know some not ever see. Sla know... make danger Vlkan. Make Sla fear. Not tell Vlkan. May be angry... shame, Sla show fear. Not want Sla frind more. What do? You help Sla know what do? Keep Vlkan safe?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok was again amazed at the hidden depths beneath the ugly exterior. Her own danger was far greater and yet it was her friend she was concerned for. He moved to sit beside her and slipped his arm about her shoulders. She leaned into him and he kissed the top of her bristly head with fatherly tenderness. He shared her concern, but for both of them. As he had listened to the stories of what her people had done, things that would undoubtedly get worse, he was vividly aware of how lucky they had been thus far. With only Velkaan who could truly be counted on to stand by her, the goblin was in grave danger from anyone and everyone for as long as the war lasted and probably a long time after... and Velkaan with her... unless some way could be found to guarantee protection. Right now, he did not have the answer she needed. He pulled her to her feet and led her back to camp.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t answer your questions right now," he whispered softly as they walked. "But I''ll think of something. You get some sleep now and we''ll talk in the morning. But you must trust me, no matter what happens," he said quickly as one of the bumpy shapes near the fire murmured his dreams aloud and the inkling of an idea began to sprout. "Will you do that?" </p>\r\n<p>Bright round eyes gazed up with all the trust of a puppy and then slipped behind her eyelids. He rolled himself into his cloak and lay back, gazing at the stars that played diamond peek-a-boo between the branches overhead. Gradually his idea settled into a workable plan and he spent the rest of the night waiting for his companions to awaken.</p>\r\n<p>Only Sula was not surprised to find him still there. Each had been of the silent opinion that he would slip away in the night and would have been secretly pleased if he had done so. There was something about his presence that each found slightly unnerving, not least the mystery with which he surrounded himself. But he had not gone and was now asking for their attention, so they left the rolling of their blankets and gathered again about the fire. He thanked them all with a warm smile and if his gaze lingered reassuringly for a fraction longer upon Sula, nobody noticed. Then he began to explain that had spent most of the night doing some serious thinking and that, if Velkaan agreed, he needed the youth to undertake a task that would require he accompany him to find the Powerwielder. The only problem was that they must go alone but this meant that Sula would have no one to look after her. He had thought deeply, he said, about who would protect her while Velkaan was away and decided that the best thing was to ask Gwym to take her back to Ador’s plateau and obtain the protection of the Sharran for the goblin. That way she would have the protection of all the gipsies since by gipsy custom, once the Sharran had spoken it was Law. He hoped that Gwym would agree. He needed to take Velkaan with him but he could not, in all conscience, take Sula’s protector from her without providing another. Ammoel was about to volunteer to go in Velkaan’s stead when, almost as though a voice had whispered in his ear, he sensed there was a lot more going on than was being said. His eyes drifted in masked curiosity from Jarok to Sula and then passed Velkaan, to join the gazes resting upon the gipsy whose doubts were clearly inscribed on his face and in his posture. For a long time only the crackling fire spoke and then dark eyes gazed solemnly at Jarok from beneath a burdened brow.</p>\r\n<p>"Though it grieves me to have to say this, I must speak truly. These are bad times, with worse to come. My people are good and honourable but they are human nonetheless and as many die at the hands of Sula’s kinsmen I can''t swear that the word of the Sharran will prevent one or more of my people from acting against her." </p>\r\n<p>He paused for a moment to look directly into the eyes of Velkaan that were screaming silent accusations of bigotry and persecution, though to his credit, the half-Soyex youth maintained an otherwise rigid and honourable control of his flaming anger and remained motionless in his seat, except to reach out for Sula’s hand. </p>\r\n<p>"I know you may not believe me but I would hold the same doubt be she Man, Elf, Dwarf, Fellis or Soyex... if it were any of those that threatened us now. Aren''t there many of those races that would do the same? Isn''t that why this situation exists?" his question drifted around the whole group.</p>\r\n<p>There was no doubting Gwym’s sincerity... or the answers to his questions and they all nodded. Jarok kept his face fixed. He had expected such an answer. Indeed it was essential to his plan, for what he wanted of Gwym he could not ask outright. It had to be offered. He resisted the urge to grin but allowed his shoulders to sag slightly as he replied in a low voice.</p>\r\n<p>"I understand, though I wish it could be otherwise. I thought that the gypsies, of all people, would be willing to... take her in. The Tribes have suffered generations of persecution and maltreatment and would surely understand her plight better than any. Still, Ador’s plateau would be as safe a place as any at the moment. Don''t you agree?"</p>\r\n<p>"Hhm?" murmured Gwym, pulling himself back from the faraway thoughts that the subtle emphasis Jarok had placed on the words... ''take her in''... had led him... just as Jarok hoped it would.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry," Gwym apologised for his strayed attention. "I was just thinking about something. You know, there might be a way... " His voice tailed off as he mulled it over in his mind. Then he gave a decisive nod and pronounced, "I will adopt her!"</p>\r\n<p>The bald words dropped loudly into the centre of the group leaving a stunned silence behind. Jarok smiled secretly to himself, he had known the gypsy would not let him down. Velkaan stared at Gwym blankly, not sure exactly how he felt about the idea. On one hand, he was pleased that Gwym was willing to adopt Sula. On the other he was frightened that she would not need him any more. He had found her and looked after her, he thought angrily, they had no right to take her away. She needed him. </p>\r\n<p>Who did this black-clothed stranger think he was anyway making decisions that would drag him all over the countryside and assuming arrogantly that he would agree? </p>\r\n<p>Let him go after his Powerwielder alone. He would stay here with Sula and then she would not need any gypsy adoption, or anything else, she would have Velkaan. Then he felt guilty that he was only really thinking about himself and not about Sula’s needs or safety. He felt a hand on his arm and snapped his head around so sharply his neck cracked. Jarok gave him a knowing smile and he flushed brightly. Stiffening, he tried to push himself to his feet but Jarok was much stronger than he looked.</p>\r\n<p>"She''ll be fine. The gypsies are a good people, I know. And you''ll be back with her soon. She needs you to be strong. Being parted with her first and deepest friend is going to be hard on her. Don''t make it any harder. Please?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan sighed and let his body relax in acquiescence to Jarok’s reasoning and his firm hand, but mostly to the subtle, hidden quality in the quiet tone that brushed his own deep yearning for acceptance and a place in the world. How could he be so selfish as to deny Sula her chance for exactly this? He squeezed her hand and nodded his willingness to Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>Ammoel sat back and watched the scene, his intrigue growing. His eyes narrowed upon Jarok and then on Sula, whose body also seemed to have lost its earlier tension and who was looking at Jarok over Velkaan’s shoulder with grateful thanks. Jarok caught Ammoel’s gaze and winked. A sardonic lift of Ammoel’s eyebrow acknowledged Jarok’s skill and expertise. Then he turned his attention back to Gwym’s careful and patient explanation to Sula, of the ritual that would make her his daughter and more importantly, that once she was so, then no matter what her appearance or birth, she would not be of those that threatened Rohansuk. She would be Gypsy. And Gypsy Law forbade one gypsy to harm another. As far back as memory went, never had this been broken. She would be assured safety amongst, and the protection of, all the Tribes. Every so often he would stop and ask Sula if she understood. Each time she deferred to Velkaan, who nodded for her. Gwym talked through the ritual again, this time insisting that Sula answer for herself since this was not a thing to be taken lightly. Once it was done, it could not be undone. After gaining Velkaan’s permission and assurance it was his wish she did this, Sula told Gwym she understood.</p>\r\n<p>"Traditionally, the ceremony takes place at night and in the presence of the Tribe concerned but I think it best if Sula and I arrive at the plateau with the deed done," he said vaguely, hoping Sula was unlikely to understand his unspoken inference. She did not... but nodded obediently along with everyone else. "Laws and Customs would usually be taught before the ceremony but again, given the circumstances I think it will be permissible to do this in the reverse. I can teach Sula on our way back. As Chieftain, I have the authority to perform the ritual myself in the absence of the Sharran. However, as I''m also a participant I must request another to stand in for me. I make this request of Velkaan. With your mixed blood... you''re as near to a gypsy as any here. And I think Sula would like it. Don''t worry, I''ll keep it short," he promised as Velkaan mumbled indecisively. "Well then. We have the fire... Velkaan, you and I need to be on the other side. We have a knife," he drew his dagger and placed it on the stones so that just the tip touched the flames. "I think we can get started."</p>\r\n<p>Everyone settled to their places. The fire crackled into the silence.</p>\r\n<p>"On the first evening... " Velkaan began reciting the words Gwym gave him in a low whisper as he walked once around the campfire. "... the mighty wheels stopped turning and by the light of the sacred fire the first Gypsy was born. In the allotted time she brought forth a daughter and she, a granddaughter. And so it was down through the generations to the birth of Tuani. In her fifteenth year, Tuani gave birth to a son whom she called Martos and to Martos was given Briorta and Fardun. Briorta gave birth to Vespana and she gave birth to Gwym." </p>\r\n<p>As his name was called, Gwym stepped through the flames.</p>\r\n<p>"All down the generations, Body and Spirit, all were Gypsy," cried Gwym proudly, then taking Sula’s hand, led her back through the flames so they stood either side of Velkaan.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan lifted the dagger from the fire and Gwym and Sula held out their left hands in front of him. </p>\r\n<p>"Hand of the Body,” said Velkaan in a low timbre, as he became caught up in the solemnity of the ritual. He drew the blade across each of their palms.</p>\r\n<p>"Heart of the Spirit,” he called up to the morning sky and cut a small nick just below their throats. </p>\r\n<p>"Blood of the Gypsy,” he cried and plunged the dagger into the fire. The blood on the blade sizzled and blackened and was carried up in a thin, black plume of smoke.</p>\r\n<p>"Hand to hand! Body to Spirit! Blood is blood,” Velkaan paused between each call as Gwym and Sula first placed their bleeding hands together, then upon each others'' throats and finally around the hilt of the dagger that Velkaan retrieved from the flames. Using the dagger, Gwym sliced a thin, sliver off a piece of wood from the fire and sharpened it to a point.</p>\r\n<p>"And Gwym fathered three children: Tielan, his son, and two daughters, Eona... and Sula." Velkaan’s voice rose loudly as he pronounced Sula’s name and she and Gwym stepped back through the fire.</p>\r\n<p>"This might sting a little," Gwym whispered, before pushing the sliver of wood through each of Sula’s earlobes. He dropped it back into the fire, then removed his own earrings and threaded them gently through Sula’s newly pierced lobes. He smiled at her warmly.</p>\r\n<p>"So the circle of life continues," Velkaan’s voice stirred the charged silence that had fallen over the company, as he too stepped forward to stand on the other side of Sula. </p>\r\n<p>"Welcome Sula, daughter of Gwym. Child of the Gypsies!"</p>\r\n<p>Before she knew it, Sula was overwhelmed by hugging arms and congratulations. She felt tears running down her cheeks but had no idea why she was crying, except that she was so happy. Then she felt a hand in hers and she turned into Velkaan’s eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"You have a new family now, who will look after you," he said softly. "But I''ll be back for you soon, if that''s what you want."</p>\r\n<p>"Sla wait Vlkan," she nodded, her happiness now complete.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok watched the scene with immense satisfaction. The light laughter reminiscent of the morning they had parted company with the knights. He saw Ammoel walk across to Roaban and, for one unguarded moment, thought it was Cymon. His heart leapt as he searched for Alyse amongst the laughing faces. His eyes clouded over with sadness. That was a long time ago. He was no longer that boy, this was not Davin’s camp and</p>\r\n<p>Alyse and Cymon were far away. The painful thoughts brought back the need for haste.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry to have to rush you but we really do need to get going."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok and Velkaan rode in a comfortable, if distant, silence. Hunched over the pommel of his saddle, his cloak wrapped tightly against the chilling wind, and staring at the cold, white world through the small gap between the ears of his horse, Velkaan’s thoughts were all for Sula. They had barely ridden out of sight before he was missing her. A few short weeks ago he would not have thought it possible that he could have cared for anyone as he did for the goblin. He remembered their first meeting, a combination of fear, anger and amazement and, step by step, all they had been through that led to this moment. Now she was going out on her own and he worried about her in every way it was possible to worry. </p>\r\n<p>Would the gypsies really accept her? </p>\r\n<p>Would they make fun of her? </p>\r\n<p>Would she be happy? </p>\r\n<p>Would she be safe, would she get enough to eat, would she remember not to eat the rats and mice she so dearly loved? </p>\r\n<p>This last led his worries on to Kretos. </p>\r\n<p>Was his friend still safe and well? </p>\r\n<p>He hoped with all his heart that he was being careful in his deadly games with the wizard. Velkaan put his hand in his pocket and rubbed the fur of the rat curled there. It seemed easy and contented and Velkaan drew some measure of confidence as to Kreto’s well being from it, though it was absurd to think the rat might know any more than he about the goings on in the wizard’s fortress. Still, he felt happier thinking of both his friends as well and happy, than to think of them otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s thoughts too, were wrapped up in his loved ones. Since he could still sense no trace of Alyse’s presence, logic demanded he return to the place he had last seen her. If she returned in the meantime she would head for Symtar, that had been her plan as Yushok had told him, hence his decision to head back along the Borrin Flow. He would either wait where he had left her or meet her on her way back. Amongst Gwym and the others, he had been able to keep his mind occupied but now, with every step, he became increasingly perturbed by her continued absence, even though he sure that the Mother would have found a way to let him know had Alyse returned to her.</p>\r\n<p>''Always assuming her spirit was left unhindered to do so,'' whispered a pessimistic voice. </p>\r\n<p>He stamped on it quickly, along with the memory of the tortured spirits of the Mornay that it conjured up. Lack of word from the Mother was the only hope he had that Alyse was still alive and he clung to it. But it should not have taken her so long to release the Heroes, unless something had gone wrong. </p>\r\n<p>But what could have gone wrong? </p>\r\n<p>She surely had too much sense than to reveal herself in Duman’s domain until the final moment when it should have been too late for Duman to respond. If so, she should have already left. Then where was she?&nbsp;He was not alone in his searching. He knew that deep within the secret passages of the Earth, the returning Dragonmarks roamed fruitlessly. The ground grumbled repeatedly with their agitation, like a bear with indigestion, as the lost Power churned and bubbled in the molten bowels of the Earth. If she did not return soon he would be forced to claim it before the mountains ruptured. </p>\r\n<p>And what of the strange bird?&nbsp;What and where was it, the mysterious danger lurking in the fog? </p>\r\n<p>Fate had certainly released it by now. His eyes lifted to the southwestern sky, the place he had last seen the drifting bank with which Fate had borrowed him a day’s grace. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head. He had not even noticed the fading light and gazed with surprise at the pale, orange highlight on the horizon that was all that remained of the setting sun. He glanced guiltily across at Velkaan, dozing in the saddle and reached out to tap him on the shoulder but the Soyex youth was not completely asleep and the minute Jarok’s horse stopped, he lifted bright, alert eyes to Jarok’s.</p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t think you were ever going to stop," he grinned, pleased by Jarok’s disconcerted expression that made his sore rump worthwhile and jumping down, began unsaddling his horse. By mutual, unspoken agreement they dispensed with a fire ate cold rations and curled into their blankets. Jarok lay on his back, following the twisted patterns of white limbs against the midnight-blue sky that echoed the twisted patterns of his thoughts in the darkness of his concerns until he could stand no more and as soon as the rhythmic snores of sleep drifted out from Velkaan’s blanket, he slipped out of his own and walked quietly to the nearest tree. </p>\r\n<p>Ignoring the fact that he was allowing anxiety to rule clear judgement and that he was being totally irresponsible in staying so close to the sleeping youth, he pressed himself against the trunk. His splayed fingers slipped beneath the cold, outer bark of the sleeping tree. He closed his eyes and let the Mother’s warmth seep from his fingertips. Tiny buds poked their heads from the frozen branches as the tree suddenly sprouted into living wakefulness. Yawning and stretching, it unfurled slender green fingers and draped a cloak of frosted-mint leaves across the silvery shoulders of its nakedness. Lilac blossom speckled in pastel pink, opened with delicate grace to gaze upon the world with single eyes of powder blue. Beneath his ear, Jarok could hear the sap rising, feel the grain spreading and the stretching wood creak with pleasure. And he felt too, its confusion as it stood in summer-rich resplendence amidst the cold, white skeletons of its wintering sisters. Jarok’s lips moved, yet no words drifted upon the silent night, only the plaintive rustling of fluttering leaves. He waited. No sound returned. Even the wind had dropped to silence. He asked again and then a third time pressed the tree for news of Alyse. Still it refused his plea. He sighed softly. Perhaps it knew nothing, he was forced to admit, and was about to give up when the branches above rippled with a faint tremor of apology and the leafy canopy began to sing in a sweet, melodious lilt:</p>\r\n<p>"Mother’s daughters. Mother’s sons. Down the ages, many come.</p>\r\n<p>Guardians know the things they seek but to them we do not speak.</p>\r\n<p>Much we learn down through the years, told only to the First Oaks'' ears. </p>\r\n<p>But thou art different... Mother’s kin. Dragonschild wields Power within. </p>\r\n<p>Mighty Oak... the First of all, bids us answer to thy call.</p>\r\n<p>Know then that the one ye name has not passed by this grand old dame.</p>\r\n<p>But seek ye west and do not tarry, for danger stalks in Serap’s Valley.</p>\r\n<p>Shadow walks in shadows grey, unlearned in its ways are they.</p>\r\n<p>Cold and silent lays the camp... deadly trap set ''neath the damp.</p>\r\n<p>If light be cast to chase the chill, then hand of Evil will She feel.</p>\r\n<p>In Natures'' law, Creation one, doth cast its shadow to the sun</p>\r\n<p>but wizard’s shadow, from laws set free, now walks alone, in search of She.</p>\r\n<p>If paths should cross and shadows meld, by sorcery will She be held.</p>\r\n<p>For joined with Hers; the same as he; Duman’s, She will surely be.</p>\r\n<p>Thus forewarned thou might find, a way the evil for to bind </p>\r\n<p>if it be thy wish to keep thy sister from the Darkness deep. </p>\r\n<p>Yet Cautions'' steed, I bid thee ride and thy secret presence hide </p>\r\n<p>And e''en to her, whom thou wouldst save remain as silent as the grave.</p>\r\n<p>Beware, that any aid ye give reveal to her that thou dost live.</p>\r\n<p>Though Power She hath, tis but slight... as nothing ''gainst the wizard’s might.</p>\r\n<p>And all that heart and mind doth hold to Duman, will be freely told.</p>\r\n<p>Not Power gained the danger be, but knowledge...

Wilt thou claim Victory for thy bride? </p>\r\n<p>In every forest some must fall... for the greater good of all.</p>\r\n<p>Fathers'' Power. Mother’s Son. Events unfold. Thy time doth come!"</p>\r\n<p>The soft, rustling melody died away and Jarok let the tree slip gently into autumn and back into its winter slumber. He pushed himself away from the trunk slowly; with only the joy that Alyse was on her return to lighten the rushing turmoil of his emotions. He knew that the words he been given had come from the Mother &mdash; a reminder of his purpose, and his promise, advice and caution against the pull of his mortal upbringing. A verbal restraint against the desire to protect those he loved with the human heart of his chosen vessel of existence, a desire at war with his knowledge of what must be done. Sooner or later, he would have to let Alyse go. </p>\r\n<p>His love for her cried: later, as late as it was in his power to make it, as late as never &mdash; but his love for the Earth, for the children of his Mother and his Father. He cried: ''Sooner!''&nbsp;That less may suffer and die, that the Dragons be freed and reunited, and Ecos... But Ecos could never return, the Mother had told him this. Ecos was gone forever except in the memories of Alyse. It was the bitter fruit that tainted the sweet hope of victory. He had tried to deny it and in waiting moments he searched for ways he might be able to make it otherwise, but he knew it was the one thing he could never do. He wanted to laugh at the ludicrous infinity of his Power that was yet powerless. Power awesome enough to take on the might of the Black Arts and yet, without substance to restore one that he loved. He wanted to laugh, but all he could manage was a pained groan. He turned to go back to his blanket, his steps heavy beneath his bowed back and his shoulders stooped under the weight of his unalterable sorrow. He lowered himself to the ground and rolled into the cover and only then noticed Velkaan, leaning up on one elbow and watching him from hooded eyes. </p>\r\n<p>He scathed himself for his emotion-induced carelessness. Twice now he had been taken unawares. First by the goblin, but she was open and innocently honest and he trusted her. Velkaan however was something completely different. The youth was deep and worldly schooled. He had survived by his wits and by taking care of number one. Apart from his blatant jealousy where Sula was concerned (probably because he had no experience with the emotion and did not recognise it in himself and therefore did not know how to control or hide it) he kept his feelings under close guard and was very difficult to read. Like now, as he sat up, pulling his knees into his chest and resting his chin upon them as he regarded Jarok with eyes darkly thoughtful and expertly shielded, so that even Jarok could not penetrate beneath their surface without alerting him. And yet, Jarok pulled the thought from amongst his misgivings and doubts, the youth had been faithful in keeping his word regarding the parchment and had taken on the goblin, cared for her and defended her... and Sula trusted him implicitly. Oh, how he wished he had listened when</p>\r\n<p>that voice had asked how he would explain himself to Velkaan. He might now have some sort of an idea!</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry if I woke you," he apologized sitting up. </p>\r\n<p>"You didn''t. I''ve been awake for some time," answered Velkaan, his words telling all but his flat tone giving away nothing of what he thought about what he had witnessed.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok rested an elbow on his knee and pressed his cheek into his fist so that one eye was pushed closed and his nose was screwed up against his knuckles. </p>\r\n<p>''Not good, not good'', he repeated to himself, squinting at Velkaan through one eye.</p>\r\n<p>"Some time eh?" He said aloud, waggling his pursed lips from side to side.</p>\r\n<p>"You know," Velkaan mused after a long difficult pause. Clear undertones of amusement warmed the heavy intrigue in his quiet voice. He was obviously well aware of Jarok’s discomfort and was, just as obviously, enjoying it immensely. "I''ve travelled just about everywhere. Lived under many strange customs. Seen all sorts of weird things, especially just lately. But I''ve never been anywhere where hugging trees till they burst into summer, is considered anything like normal behaviour." He paused to allow Jarok to squirm a little more. "I''d love to go there. Where is it you''re from?" There was no amusement in his voice now &mdash; just a cutting-edge demanding honest answers while his eyes pierced Jarok’s brown depths. Then suddenly, he relaxed, shrugged and sighed. "I know... you can''t say. I don''t really know why I trust you; other than Sula told me to and she never seems to be wrong; but I do. Even so, I don''t give my trust lightly, you understand," he added with a wink that revealed the youth behind the maturity of his eyes, "a little in return would surely be only fair. How about a name, at least?"</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it was the youth in Velkaan that touched the little boy in Jarok. The youth behind the enormity of experiences in his struggle to survive that reached out with empathy to the lonely little boy that had been dragged along in the re-birth of a Being beyond imagining &mdash; an empathy to which that little boy responded with gratitude and relief. Two lost boys orphaned of their childhood and understood place in the world, recognising a kindred spirit in each other.</p>\r\n<p>Or maybe it was simply that he had been caught red-handed without the ability to lie himself out of the situation! </p>\r\n<p>But whichever way it was, Jarok found himself talking freely with Velkaan who, to his surprise, seemed to take it all in his stride and with remarkable calm. To his chagrin he found that once he started, he could not stop and left little unsaid. Explaining everything from Cymon’s arrival to his present dilemma. Afterwards, Jarok felt as though a great weight had been lifted from him. He was not sure that the Mother would approve of what he had done and maybe in the future he would be better able to carry such responsibilities alone but he hoped She would understand. For all his growth and abilities, in experience he was still only eight years and some days old. And he missed Alyse and Cymon and Royle. Velkaan was not really as calm as he pretended, which made his skill at concealing his thoughts all the more remarkable. Admittedly he had covered a lot of shock and amazement, watching the tree bloom and fade, and thus, had time to regain his composure before Jarok had noticed him watching. Plus, he had also spent time in Ak''thai (not the most real of places and a good introduction to the realm of the unbelievable) and he had always believed in the Mother. Still it took all his skill to hold the mask of composure upon his face. As he listened, he sympathized with Jarok’s sense of a world ripped away and of being thrust into a life of aloneness. He knew that feeling of being adrift on a turbulent sea with only a leaky raft between tomorrow and the airless depths. So what if this person was capable of performing great deeds? Alone is alone... however powerful you are. Everyone needed a friend to talk to, he had learnt that much since meeting Sula. So, as Jarok finished revealing the story of his life, Velkaan hid his fluttering of wonder and when the tale was over, gave a low whistle through a lop-sided grin. "So what you really need is a good liar,” he quipped.</p>\r\n<p>"I''d prefer to say ''Storyteller''," replied Jarok. "Then I''m your man!" He took Jarok’s hand and shook it. "Sun''s up. We''d better get moving."</p>\r\n<p>And that was that, Jarok realised, staring down at his spit-stained palm in bemusement, much as Kretos had done, while Velkaan strode off to saddle the horses.</p>\r\n<p>It was around mid-morning when Jarok suddenly leapt from his horse and flattened himself against the snowy earth. He rose with shining eyes and a beaming smile whose brilliance, the sun herself might have envied. Velkaan was not in the least surprise to learn that Alyse had returned from &mdash; wherever &mdash; and her companions with her. Overjoyed by his discovery, Jarok barely noticed the leagues passing into the distance. Only as they came within sight of their destination did his elation begin to pale and anxiety once more raise its nagging head.&nbsp;Had the words of the tree borne fruit? Had Duman’s Shadow already taken possession of Alyse? </p>\r\n<p>Was he too late? </p>\r\n<p>Jarok knew he had to let events take their course but somehow, he had to keep her one step ahead of Duman for as long as possible. The Heroes were badly needed. Though it had been only a few days since battle had finally been joined openly between the two forces, already things were going badly. The casualties were tremendous with scarce to show for it. It would take days more as it was, before the Heroes arrived at their destinations and by then the flagging strength of the defenders would surely drain the stamina of their morale. So it had already been written and with it, that renewed hope would come from the presence of the lost Heroes. Once Alyse became Duman’s, she might prevent the Heroes from getting where they were meant to be. And of course, there was her overdue birthday gift...&nbsp;Velkaan’s remarks about the weather and queries as to direction interrupted his thoughts. The sky had been overcast all day and was getting duller by the moment. It was going to snow shortly, Velkaan informed him unnecessarily. Jarok pointed to the river ahead. They stopped where its bank flattened out. The horses dropped their muzzles to the water. Jarok scooped himself a drink and stared up river. The not knowing was driving him to distraction. He threw himself against the pebbled stones of the rivers'' edge, his mind jumping from one to another long the river. There they were! A good gallop would meet them by day’s end. He tried to listen to their conversation but the stones preferred the gay, sparkling words of the flighty waters than the boring monotones of the passing people. All he did manage to glean was that there were five on foot. Just behind them he sensed Defiant’s strong and sure gait &mdash; and some way behind him the prancing skit of Alyse’s mare. He touched their rhythm again to verify his suspicions. Alyse was riding Defiant. Jarok frowned as he pulled back to his body. There had been something wrong about the mare’s gait &mdash; agitated, stiff and jerky. Not the smooth grace of a well-balanced horse. He had sensed something similar before, in the bird outside Phelise. He jumped to his feet.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="JarokAndRoyle" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Jarok and Royle" src="JarokAndRoyle01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>"It''s in the mare, Velkaan," he cried aloud, grabbing at his horses'' bridle so sharply the horse reared and spun, knocking him off his feet and into the icy water. Feeling like a complete fool he dragged himself out of the river, water dripping into a puddle at his feet and steam rising from his head and shoulders as his inner heat began to dry his sodden clothes. He knew he was blushing furiously, he could feel the throbbing in his cheeks, and steeled himself for the mocking gaze surely awaiting him. But Velkaan was paying him no attention. Instead his eyes were narrowed into the distance. He pointed as Jarok came to stand beside him.</p>\r\n<p>"Something''s coming," he said. "Straight for us."</p>\r\n<p>Like a blot on a blank page, the black smudge spread and grew larger. Jarok recognised the shape and form and the lazy, loping stride immediately.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s only Royle," Jarok told him and then frowned. "I wasn''t expecting him to show up though."</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter Velkaan found himself the object of yellow-gleamed suspicion as Royle stalked around his legs regarding him through eyes narrowed to thin slits and an unpleasant growl lingering in the back of his throat.</p>\r\n<p>"Put your hackles down Royle," Jarok scolded softly. "He''s with me. What are you doing here anyway? Why aren''t you with Alyse? The thing I was worried about, the thing that''s after her? It''s in the mare."</p>\r\n<p>"So that''s why she''s been acting so strangely," murmured Royle, in a series of hissing mewls. "It''s alright. Cymon wasn''t happy with her behaviour and made Alyse ride Defiant instead. It''s causing some arguments, I can tell you. Cymon won''t even let her go and tend to it."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan watched with curiosity (he had given up surprise as a waste of effort) as Jarok, who had gotten down on all fours, and the cat conversed in the strange mix of growls, spits and body movements. He had no idea what they were saying to each other but guessed much concerned himself, since the cat consistently slipped him steely glares in between the pauses. Then without warning, the cat arched his hackled back and unsheathed his claws, hissing volubly in time with his angrily swishing tail. Jarok went very, very still... then suddenly slapped the ground, sending a flurry of snow scooting upwards into Royale’s face making the cat sneeze and cough.</p>\r\n<p>"I think you''ve said just about enough," Jarok warned, in a low, imperious voice seething with anger that sent shivers up Velkaans spine as he caught a glimpse of the Being beneath. And it was only a glimpse, for the next moment Jarok was sitting cross-legged beside the cat and stroking its back with reconciliatory affection. </p>\r\n<p>"With all due respect," Jarok told him, in human tongue that Velkaan could understand, as he scratched the cats'' ears. "You''ll have more difficulty in explaining how this came into your possession than Velkaan will," and from out of a small bag on his belt Jarok pulled a shimmering, amber stone of a deepest yellow that was not yet quite orange.</p>\r\n<p>"The Eye of Ecos,” breathed Velkaan, reaching out reverently to accept the jewel Jarok offered him.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re telling me you know what it is?" Yushok asked in disbelief, holding out his palm for his turn to cradle the precious ''Eye''.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m an orphan, not an ignorant," replied Velkaan curtly. "My father taught us all to read and write." Then admitted with a wry grin. "The only book he had was ''The Life of U''min''. That''s really why I recognise it. Anyway... who are you?"</p>\r\n<p>"Well, at least he''s honest... if not too bright," Yushok rolled his eyes and shook his head at Jarok. "I think we''ll do just fine," he gave the ''Eye'' back to Velkaan and with an impish wink caused the air to shimmer around him. To Velkaan’s utter amazement Royle purred his pressing body against his calves.</p>\r\n<p>"Did I forget to mention Yushok?" Jarok asked the open-jawed Velkaan, who could only nod as he watched the A''mathan washing himself in his own inimitable style. But, as surprises go, this was only one in a long list he had witnessed of late and he was quickly back in control of himself, much to Royale’s annoyance. Velkaan picked him up and threatened to throw him in the river if he did not stop sharpening his claws on his leg. Royle licked his hand, unimpressed by the threat and dropped nimbly to ground, sitting to attention as Jarok asked Velkaan his plan for inveigling himself with Alyse’s company.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t really have one at the moment." Velkaan’s shrug did little for Jarok’s confidence. "I generally play by ear. You know, weave the story on the reactions of the audience. Trust me," he squeezed Jarok’s shoulder as a glint of doubt trickled its way passed Jarok’s control into his earth-brown eyes. "I''m the best... if I do say so myself!" Velkaan pulled his shoulders back to match the cocky tilt of his head and the arrogant stride that carried him to his horse. Then he vaulted aboard and with a carefree wave, galloped across the river and headed north.</p>\r\n<p>"But you''re going the wrong way... ,” Jarok’s confused cry faded after him.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure he knows what he''s doing," Royle murmured facetiously, moistening a pad and rubbing it over his right ear. </p>\r\n<p>"I just hope I do," replied Jarok with a sardonic lift of an eyebrow. Then he vaulted onto his own horse and rode in search of cover from where he could keep an eye on the proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>Royle glanced up from the final nip that put the tip of his tail in order, to find himself alone. He swung his head slowly from one side of the river to the other, stood up, gave himself a good shake and then with a last lick behind his ear, loped back up river to rejoin Alyse and Cymon.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 25, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

When he arrived he almost fell to the ground in his haste to get to Alyse’s side. To his intense relief and joy she was already awake and though still alarmingly pale, there was a faint hue of pink in her cheeks. Her eyes were sad, sparkling with flickering colours as the firelight reflected on the tears gathered there. As soon as she saw him she dropped the mug she had been sipping from and leaned into his comforting arms and soothing words.<p></p>\r\n<p>"Oh, Cymon," she cried in a wrenched whisper. "There are so many of them. And so few that return with good tidings. And Cymon, one of them is Sir Tynan!" her voice broke on his name and she sobbed bitterly. Cymon let her cry for a while before asking whether the knight was dead. She shook her head, sniffing as she wiped her nose and gazed at him with puffy eyes dull with hopelessness.</p>\r\n<p>"Not at the time of the Dragonmarks'' departure, but as close to that a mere breath of wind would carry him away. The ''Mark brought a glimpse of darkness and cold rock and a sense of emptiness. Cymon, I fear there is no one to help him. He is to die, just like so many of the others and it is all my fault."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon took her by the shoulders and shook her roughly. He did not need to speak, verbally or mentally, for his stern face said all that needed to be said. Alyse straightened her back, squared her shoulders and smoothed her tousled hair, so that she was sitting in composed control when the others came puffing into the camp inquiring after her health. She thanked them with assurances that she was now quite recovered. Then she explained to the bewildered Heroes (now that they had time to remark on their rescuers strange apparel and speech) how long they had actually been imprisoned, the story of the Dragonmarks and to Cymon and Yushok, that what had seemed only a short time in Duman’s domain, had actually been days. She told them all that the war had began in earnest and that already all was definitely not well. They must press on to Symtar immediately, she said. None of them would allow her to travel, however much she protested, threatening to sit on her to keep her down if she did not agree to rest for the remainder of the night. Their united concern for her well-being did more to aid the return of her strength than a weeks'' sleep and she hugged them all.</p>\r\n<p>"Harumph,” blustered Palach, rubbing a fist under his bulbous nose. "To bed with thee. Thou doth only waste rest-time with such frivolity," he said, matter-of-factly but he gave her a tender smile as he tucked the blanket under her chin.</p>\r\n<p>Later that night the small, white mare, paced restlessly in the shadows. Every so often she tried to snicker a warning to Defiant but the sound was cut off in her throat as the Shadow within squeezed tighter upon her mind. Unlike its previous hosts the Elfin mare was strong and still, after two days, continued her resistance. The Shadow had been elated when the two males had arrived with the girl it sought and even more when the first tentative flames licked at the kindling, laid within the stone hearth. Soon the dancing light would cast the grey shadows upon the ground and it would have its prey... and shortly thereafter its reward. But, as with most plans of seeming ease, it was not to be so simple. Every time it tried to get close enough, the white stallion herded it back into the night. The one time that it did manage to evade attention, the camp was so crowded with blacks and greys that it dared not attempt transfer for fear of being ripped apart. It had trotted back into the darkness and hung its head, seething frustration railing angrily against the little mares'' pitiful surge of triumph. </p>\r\n<p>Then to add insult to injury, the next day had dawned dark and dingy with no hope of a break in the dense clouds that obscured the sun. The Shadow had reacted with a display of bucking displeasure and snapping teeth to which, for once, the mare had not resisted. Had it not been so furious the Shadow might have heeded this and been warned but it was too angry and so did itself, spoil its chances. For after this outburst, Cymon refused to allow Alyse near the mare and insisted she ride Defiant instead. Defiant whinnied his agreement, having become increasingly puzzled by the untoward antics of the normally placid mare and even placed himself between the two when Alyse made to stroke the mare in an effort to calm her. U''min said he would take care of her and led her off onto the other side of the group.</p>\r\n<p>But the mare refused to settle, becoming increasingly agitated with each passing league and when she came cantering into the camp and lunged towards Alyse on the evening of the second night, Cymon decided to hobble and stake her and ordered that she be kept on a rein at all times thereafter. Alyse argued vehemently with his decision, at one point threatening dire consequences should he refuse to let her pass to tend to the animal. With angry impatience Cymon told her to dare try... if she wanted Duman straight down on their heads. He told her to be reasonable. That she was not thinking clearly. They had come too far to jeopardize it all by being stupid now. She in turn warned him never to call her stupid again and ordered him out of her way, to which Cymon drew his sword and said if she took one step closer he would kill the beast and be done with it! </p>\r\n<p>The Heroes gazed open-mouthed from one to the other, each secretly siding with Cymon but none daring to interfere as Alyse screamed furiously at an adamant Cymon, who glared back at her with the stubbornness of a paralysed mule.</p>\r\n<p>"What the Mother is going on here?" Yushok’s livid voice ripped like thunder into their midst when he walked into the fraught scene. </p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="JarokAndYushok" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Jarok and Yushok" src="JarokAndYushok01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>Cymon stood with sword raised and pointed at Alyse no less! </p>\r\n<p>Alyse with hands on hips, upper body swaying forward and her hair frizzling and crackling with the charged energy of her denied anger </p>\r\n<p>The four Heroes grouped together with worried, anxious faces, not knowing what to do for the best.&nbsp;Yushok’s heart dropped to his stomach.</p>\r\n<p>"Ask him," Alyse snapped bitterly, flouncing back to the fire. Yushok stared after her. In all the years he had watched over her, he had never seen her behave in such a child-like fashion. For one awful moment he feared he was too late, until Cymon explained the reason behind their disagreement and he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p>"Cymon''s quite right. If there is something ailing the mare there''s nothing you can do about it. The last thing we need is Duman picking us up. Remember, he''s got plenty of help out here now. The only thing we can do for her right now is ensure she doesn''t hurt herself. Listen to me Alyse," he said firmly, when Alyse began to argue again. "Be you Dragon or no Dragon, you will do as you''re told in this and stay away from her. Do you hear?" He practically screamed the last at her and the whole camp froze. Suddenly realising he had gone too far and would not be able to explain satisfactorily without implicating Jarok, Yushok escaped into Royle and Royle fled into the night.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the cheering fire, the camp was cold and dismal after Royle left. Alyse and Cymon glowered at each other from opposite sides of the flames, with Torje and Gregos sitting uncomfortably between the two. U''min stood with his arms folded staring thoughtfully at the white mare and Palach wandered the edges of the camp supposedly to watch but calling softly for Royle from cupped hands. But all that was forgotten, when a weary voice called from the darkness.</p>\r\n<p>"''Looo, the camp? I''m be beggin'' shelter... "</p>\r\n<p>"Show yourself."</p>\r\n<p>Weary, bedraggled and forlorn, the horse shuffled tired legs through the snow. Its coat was thick with mud and ice, its nostrils flaring heavily. Velkaan did not fare much better as he slid from its saddle-less back. His cloak and boots were gone and his shirt and trousers ripped. He too, was covered in mud and grime and blood trickled from a cut on his forehead.</p>\r\n<p>"Please," he croaked. "Food for me horse... and warmth... he''s carried me many a ways and he’s sore-foot and hungry," and then he dropped, exhausted, to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>He lay by the fire listening to the quiet murmurings going on around. Alyse was ''tut-tutting'' about the condition of the horse. Velkaan was also unhappy about it but he had borne in mind all that Jarok had said about his sister and knew that he must make the facts look as convincing as possible. Therefore, after apologising profusely and promising all manner of restitution for the misuse, he had lathered it with mud and snow and galloped the poor creature in circles all day. The dwarf and the man remarked on his lack of saddle and scant clothing, which Velkaan had dumped and torn accordingly, before turning his horses'' head for their camp. After washing the cut on his head, Cymon (Velkaan guessed it was he since none of the others looked Elfin) remarked that it looked as though he had been hit with something. Which indeed he had, the biggest rock he could find. It was not easy thing to do, hit oneself and make it look like another had done it. It took great skill (not to mention insane dedication) to get just the right amount of force to produce an adequate lump and bruising with minimal damage. In fact it had taken three, skilful whacks before he perfected his present injury! </p>\r\n<p>It was not something he would recommend to anyone but in this case, he had decided, a bleeding cut might well win him the sympathy vote. A decision that seemed well made, he noted as he opened his eyes and saw the gentle concern returned by those of Alyse who had come to check on Velkaan herself. He smiled wanly when she asked if he was able to sit up and moaned at just the right moment, so that she beckoned Cymon to come help him. Then she was insisting he drink the brew she placed in his hands before allowing the others their questions.</p>\r\n<p>"Me horse?" he asked earnestly.</p>\r\n<p>"Is fine. Torje has taken care of him and he is grazing contentedly," answered Alyse. "Are you well enough now to tell us what has befallen you?"</p>\r\n<p>He nodded and began his tale.</p>\r\n<p>"We was trapping in Storringay, Black Par and me. White hares is all the fashion you see, plenty in Storringay if''n you knows where to look. Black Par took me on when me mam died. Me dad went when I was a baby. Was kinda like an uncle, Black Par. Told me everything he knew. Taught meself the rest. Anyhoows, we''s camped just on the edge of the forest. </p>\r\n<p>''Get an early start for Newhope come morning, young Kaan,'' says Black Par. </p>\r\n<p>Kaan... that''s me... Kaan," he repeated, tapping his chest. "Only we didn''t get to Newhope. Got an early start though," he gazed away into the night, eyes shimmering, chin quivering as he ''remembered''.</p>\r\n<p>"In thine own time, young fellow. We shalt not press thee," murmured Gregos softly.</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan felt the corner of his mouth twitch and buried his face in his mug while he took a quick look at the faces of those watching him. Gregos, Torje and U''min were his for the taking. Palach was staring dourly, hardly blinking. Cymon too, held suspicion at the forefront of his gaze... and Alyse? </p>\r\n<p>Well, he did not even try to gauge her thoughts, sniffing instead and wiping his nose on the cuff of his ragged shirt. Palach grunted and threw him a kerchief from his pocket. Velkaan nodded gratefully, blew his nose, took another sip of his drink, coughed and winced. Through hooded lashes he saw the flash of concern that flitted across Alyse’s face.</p>\r\n<p>"We didn''t bother with a watch. Hadn''t seen no-one for days, not since we left some men as told us there''s some fightin'' goin'' on in Symtar and everyone was gone there. They asked us to join ''em, but Black Par, he said he was too old for fightin''... and I couldn''t leave ''im on his own... not after he''d been so good to me an all." He stopped for breath and another drink. "Anyhoows, the fire''d gone out an'' I woke up freezing. Lucky for me, saved me life it did. I seen ''em comin'', out the trees. Asneakin'' and acreepin''. I shouted to Black Par. </p>\r\n<p>''PAR!'', I shouted. But he''d been drinkin''...&nbsp;on account of ''is old bones, you understand," his voice rose in stout defence of his lost ''uncle''. "Has to do somethin'' to stave off the cold on long winters nights. But he don''t never let me touch none. Oh no! Got scruples ''as Black Par. I''s not old enough to be slurping the hard stuff, he says. Anyhoows, as I was sayin''. They jumped on ''im in ''is sleep. Weren''t nothin'' else I could do," he let the tears fall down his cheeks as he pleaded for their understanding. "I just jumped on me horse and galloped out of there as fast as he would go. Didn''t even ''ave time to grab me boots. Lost everythin''. Me boots, me cloak, me furs an'' Black Par besides. If''n only I could''ve saved Black Par... the rest wouldn''t ''ave mattered. All I''ve got left is me horse, me stone, an'' what''s on me back." </p>\r\n<p>He paused there, drifting off into his grief for a while to listen to their reactions to his story so far. He smiled inwardly. It was going quite well, if he did say so himself. Cymon was saying he had a spare shirt in his pack and they could rip up one of the food sacks to wrap about his feet until he could get some boots from somewhere. Even the dwarf seemed to be softening; at least he had stopped his low rumblings of disbelief. Then, out of the corner of his eye he noticed the mare creeping forward. He knew that it could not reach them, the rope to which it was staked was far too short but as he gazed into its eyes he shuddered, remembering what Jarok had told him of what lurked beneath the surface.</p>\r\n<p>"Art thou still cold?" inquired Torje. "Doth thou desire another blanket?" Velkaan thanked him but declined. </p>\r\n<p>"Just the ''memberin''. It''s gone now." He tried a wan smile and was pleased by the effect, as Torje immediately wrapped another blanket around him anyway.</p>\r\n<p>"What wilt thou do now?" asked U''min.</p>\r\n<p>"He will have to come with us," replied Alyse but Velkaan shook his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Thankin'' you all the same lady, but I''s thinkin'' of goin'' to Talgheer."</p>\r\n<p>"Why? That''s a long way on your own, especially in your condition and without provisions," said Cymon, his suspicions back. But Velkaan was ready for it. Was counting on the question in fact, to slip in the first part of his mission.</p>\r\n<p>"I knows it but I''ll be okay. Used to livin'' rough, I am. Talgheer''s the place for tradin'' an'' I''ll get me a better price there than anywheres else. Kill two birds with one stone, so to speak," he grinned. "Them as told us ''bout the fightin'', they said as there''s Soyex there (he pronounced the ''x'' hard, as many of the common folk were wont to do). Me dad was Soyex, so me mam always said, maybe ''as how I''ve got me some family there. Anyhoows, that''s what I aims to do. Sell me stone and find me a family," he finished decisively. </p>\r\n<p>"I mean no offence," said Gregos. "But ''tis not likely that any wilt desire to purchase a stone. Mayhap thou wouldst do better to heed the advice of the Lady Alyse and join thine company with ours."</p>\r\n<p>"Ah,” Velkaan tapped the side of his nose. "But this''n stone''s real pretty. Some lady''ll want it for sure." He left the slightest pause, then glanced at Palach and said in a vague aside. "They said as they was dwarves there too. Didn''t believe ''em... till I seen you."</p>\r\n<p>"Art thou certain of this?" demanded Palach grabbing his knee fiercely. Velkaan had no need to feign the wince of pain that twisted his face.</p>\r\n<p>"Course I don''t know for sure, I only knows what I''s told," he shrugged, prising Palachs'' fingers loose and then scowled accusingly at the dwarf as he rubbed his knee. "Weren''t no call for bein'' spiteful!" He folded his arms over his chest and slumped miserably into himself. </p>\r\n<p>"Kaan," Alyse began gently, having moved to sit next to him and taken one of his hands in hers. "This is very important. These men you talk of... who were they? Can you remember? Did they tell you their names?"</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan gave her a hurt look and remained defiantly silent to her questions. </p>\r\n<p>"Weren''t no need for that," he rubbed his knee again. "Didn''t do nothin'' to him none," he grumbled moodily.</p>\r\n<p>"Palach is sorry," Alyse glared at the dwarf until he grunted an apology. </p>\r\n<p>"Better''n nothin'', I ''spose," Velkaan mumbled grudgingly, before turning his face to Alyse. "As I recall, they said they was Me... li... sha," he said haltingly and then screwed up his face and shrugged, "... whatever that is. All ''ceptin one. Now, he said as he was a knight, and he was the one as said the Soyex and Dwarves was at Talgheer. Said he''d just come from Symtar and they was Knights and Elfins there, and did we wants to join ''im. All dressed in green and brown ''e was, looked like a tree." He closed his eyes, rubbing his nose on his cuff until Palach coughed and he remembered the kerchief. "Had a tattoo. Right here," He pushed up what was left of his sleeve and tapped his left wrist. "Don''t know what of, I only saw a bit of it but it was real colourful. What was it he said es name was again?" Velkaan frowned thoughtfully and scratched his head. "Raben, that''s it," he finished with a decisive nod that faltered as he added, "... or was it Roben... ? Rebban... ? Ra... ?"</p>\r\n<p>"Roaban?" offered Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Ro..ab..an?" Velkaan tested the name on his tongue and then clicked his fingers. "That''s it! Roaban. ''Ow did you know?" he asked curiously.</p>\r\n<p>"We know him," Cymon answered for Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, fancy an'' all! Us knowin'' the same people," he said easily, ignoring the suspicious glint flickering in Cymon’s narrowed gaze. "Must be one o'' them ''concidentals'' Black Par used to talk about. Wish I could''ve saved ''im but. T''ain''t gonna be the same without ''im... " he muttered quietly to himself and then, allowing his gaze to drift off into the distance, fell silent and listened as they began talking amongst themselves as to whether or not they should continue on to Symtar as planned. U''min and Palach were insisting they must go to their kinsmen in Talgheer, that was where they were needed now. Cymon was arguing that they could not be sure what Kaan had told them was true, though his mention of the Dragonmark did lend credence to his tale. Torje and Gregos then agreed that they should refrain from the argument as their opinions must naturally be biased, since either way their kin were at Symtar and so that was where they desired to be. By now Palach was adamant that he was going to Talgheer and refusing to listen to anything Cymon said. Which left only Torje undecided.</p>\r\n<p>"What do you think Alyse?" asked Cymon.</p>\r\n<p>"It is too far to verify without using the Power." Her voice drifting low and disappointed from the shadows startled them. Only Velkaan had seen her leave. </p>\r\n<p>"Where have you been?" Cymon’s worry lifted his question into a demand. </p>\r\n<p>She ignored him and went to sit by Velkaan. It took almost everything he had to maintain her steady gaze. He saw indecision, anxiety and just a hint of desperation glittering faintly in the corner but he was also terrifyingly aware of the hard strength and underlying Power beneath. He was glad that she had not been of a mind, or in a position (he prayed fervently that Jarok had been right in this), to delve with those eyes for the truth in him and even though he was only deceiving her for the greater good, he was suddenly gripped by a rush of guilt and shame, and a certainty that she would not take kindly to it, that made him quiver with apprehension. He cursed inwardly, at the hot blood that began to stain his face and neck, and at his wayward gaze that all at once refused to be still and hopped from ground to sky to horizon, anywhere but into the directness of hers. Even so, habit and training kept her within the periphery of his vision. He saw her brow crease into a frown and as her head tilted slightly, he caught a glimpse of orange-red through her long lashes. Surely her eyes had been blue?</p>\r\n<p>''Get a hold of yourself before you ruin everything'', a tiny voice warned from inside. </p>\r\n<p>''The best line of defence is offence'' reminded another and so he jumped to his feet, eyes glaring with defiance.</p>\r\n<p>"You got no call to stare at me like I''s a liar," he shouted at her. "You asked, an'' I told. I thanks you for your ''ospitables but I''ll be goin'' now."</p>\r\n<p>"Please. Sit down Kaan." </p>\r\n<p>Despite the quiet, friendly request Velkaan’s, stomach fluttered alarmingly as she patted the rock beside her. He chewed his lips, testing his options and finding none. So, feeling like a cornered fox before the hounds, he sat... but not without glowering darkly at the watching group. </p>\r\n<p>"I think that you have misunderstood me. I apologize if the intensity of my gaze frightened you, I forgot myself for a moment."</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan had no idea what she was talking about but he shrugged and relaxed somewhat as he accepted her apology.</p>\r\n<p>"I was merely absorbed in my thoughts. It suddenly occurred to me how strange it was that of all people, you should run into us on your flight, having already met a man who is our friend and who gave you information that could be vital to the success of our quest. Do you not think this strange?"</p>\r\n<p>"Guess so," Velkaan shrugged with assumed disinterest, though his stomach was tied tighter than a Fellisan purse.</p>\r\n<p>"Strange too I feel, since you said yourself that you had seen no-one for days, that in all the empty places, these men should discover and attack you and cause you to flee this... "</p>\r\n<p>Velkaan suddenly saw his chance to introduce the remaining piece of his puzzle and, hopefully, avert growing suspicions as to his intentions.</p>\r\n<p>"They wasn''t men,” he blurted out and then clamped his lips tightly shut and widened his eyes in horror of having let something slip. If the atmosphere had been tense before, now it was positively straining. Alyse grabbed his chin and pulled his face to hers.</p>\r\n<p>"What were they?" she demanded so forcefully, Velkaan winced. He was going to have a bruise there tomorrow, he thought absently as he affected a hesitant silence.</p>\r\n<p>"I... I wasn''t goin'' to say. I thought you''d think I''s makin'' it up. But seein'' as how you all think as I''m lyin'' anyway... " he cried accusingly, "... I''ll tell you. I couldn''t see ''em right clearly, it bein'' dark an'' all, but they''s arms way down passed their knees and they''s hands and feet twice as big as his''n," he pointed to Gregos. "Didn''t have no boots though, just big, ''airy feet. One of them looked straight at me," he slipped to the ground hugging his knees tightly and shaking like a sapling on a windy day. "Its eyes were big as the moon and it had sharp, pointy teeth." He closed his eyes, using the memory of the aftermath of his first goblin encounter to bring authenticity to his reactions. He began rocking from side to side and his voice rose until it was bordering on hysteria. "Black Par was gurgling somethin'' awful. They''s apullin'' An'' they''s awrenchin''. An'' there was bones acrackin''. An they''s laughin''," his eyes were full of all the horror of that night he had tried so hard to forget as they lifted from his knees. "Laughin'',” he cried, staring round the blurred company through his tears. "Laughin''... an'' achompin''. I think they''s eatin'' him! I just jumped on me horse an'' ran an'' ran... "</p>\r\n<p>Warm arms wrapped around him and a soft voice shushed his trembling sobs. Someone pushed a hot mug into his hands and lifted it to his mouth. He took a few sips of the sweet liquid in between calming gulps of air. </p>\r\n<p>"Do you have any idea what these creatures might be?" he heard Cymon ask Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"No, but only Duman could have such abominations."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s reply was almost his undoing. How dare she speak of Sula in that way! His mouth opened, an angry retort only a flick of his tongue away before sanity returned. Luckily, Alyse misinterpreted his sudden stiffness as fear and rubbed his arm reassuringly.</p>\r\n<p>"They cannot hurt you now. You are safe. But I cannot understand why they would go so far just to attack you. Storringay is a long way from Ak''thai."</p>\r\n<p>"Ak Fai?" he sniffed with suitable ignorance.</p>\r\n<p>"The wizard’s fortress," she replied absently. "Tell us again what you had with you."</p>\r\n<p>"Horses, traps, furs... a few provisions... and Black Pars'' jugs."</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing else?" she prompted. "Think!"</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing," he shrugged.</p>\r\n<p>"What of this stone thou hath mentioned?" Asked Torje.</p>\r\n<p>"What about it?" None of his inner triumph showed in the vague question, or the innocent manner in which he pulled the ''Eye'' from his pocket, holding it out in the palm of his hand. At their shocked gasps, he clenched his fist around it and drew it tightly to his chest.</p>\r\n<p>"Where did you get that?" asked Alyse, but softly not harshly. </p>\r\n<p>"I didn''t steal it, if that''s what your thinkin''? First I''s a liar, now I''s a thief,” he rounded bitterly. "Not as its any of your business," he insisted before laying out his defence. "But if''n you must know, I''s setting me trap in the hollow of some roots but the peg hit somethin'' an'' wouldn''t go in. So I scrapes out the dirt to see what it was... an'' finds this," he waved the fist covered Eye. "I never stole nothin'' from no-one. Black Par wouldn''t hold with no stealin'', no sir, he wouldn''t! Black me up a treat if''n I did, so he would!" When he had finished he stared down at the ground, refusing to look back up.</p>\r\n<p>"None of us think you are a thief, Kaan," Alyse assured him. "But what you have is no ordinary stone. It is something very rare and precious. It is called the ''Eye of Ecos''. And I think it was this, your attackers were looking for. Their master wants this... ''stone''... more than anything else in the world... "</p>\r\n<p>"Not quite anything," mumbled Cymon, in a bitter aside.</p>\r\n<p>"... You were very lucky to have escaped. But you may not be so again."</p>\r\n<p>"You mean they''ll come after me? What can I do?"</p>\r\n<p>"Give the stone to me," she said, slowly holding out her hand.</p>\r\n<p>"But... it''s all I''s got now," he moaned.</p>\r\n<p>"I understand but is it worth your life," she asked then went on before he could answer. "It is not only for your sake that I make this request. These are perilous times. More than you can imagine. My friends and I are trying to do what we can but I am afraid it will not be enough. What you possess is very powerful and could make the difference between success and failure."</p>\r\n<p>"If''n it''s somethin'' powerful, like you say, then I could just use it for meself," he jumped in. "Why would I give it to you?"</p>\r\n<p>"It will kill you if you try," Alyse told him bluntly. "I could take it from you as easily as you blink but that is not my way. Instead I will ask you, will you give it to me, Kaan? Please?" </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan opened his fist and stared long and hard at the ''Eye'' as though trying to decide what to do. Inside he was laughing. Everything had gone just the way Jarok had wanted. Just a little longer, he told himself. Such a prize would be too tempting to relinquish easily.</p>\r\n<p>A little longer, just to think some more... and then... </p>\r\n<p>"Take it," he thrust out his hand. "Whatever you''re goin'' to do make it good... for Black Par." </p>\r\n<p>A nice touch, he congratulated himself.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you." Alyse leaned forward and kissed his cheek as she took it. "I will remember your selflessness. But for now I think we can find something that you may use to trade instead. Palach. Your dagger and sheath perhaps. There is little dwarven workmanship in Rohansuk. It should fetch a good price."</p>\r\n<p>"A very good price," Palach corrected her, mumbling objectionably as he unclipped the sheath and handed it to Velkaan. But by the time Velkaan had finished admiring and applauding its excellence, Palach was beaming and pressing it upon him when he tried to refuse by saying it was far too valuable for him.</p>\r\n<p>Their friendly bantering dimmed as Alyse closed her eyes and unconsciously responded to the call of the ''Eye''. Beneath the cold, hard exterior of the casing, she could feel the rippling, molten flow of its hidden treasure against her flesh. A golden hue spread slowly across her cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>"Be careful, Alyse," Cymons warning tinkled like a tiny bell in her mind.</p>\r\n<p>She nodded, throwing him a grateful smile as she drew away from it, slipped it into her pocket and herself back into the conversation of the group.</p>\r\n<p>A pleasant purr thrummed quietly in the darkness just beyond the fires'' light as the A''mathan chuckled with delight. Velkaan had not been over-rating himself when he said he was the best, he thought to himself, having watched with amused admiration as his group of friends had been expertly manipulated and, with consummate skill and delicate touch, drawn into Velkaan’s carefully spun web. It must have taken him years to perfect such a talent, he thought curiously, which led him to wondering as to what strange paths'' had brought him, at such an early age, to this moment in his life. The possibilities kept Royle occupied while he crouched, waiting until everyone (except Cymon who was keeping watch) had retired, to slip silently back into camp. He padded stealthily passed each lumpy blanket until he came to Alyse. Sniffing delicately to make sure she was asleep, he curled up into a tight ball against the warmth of her back and settled into a light doze with one eye on the shadows and both ears pricked and alert for every move of the white mare that strained ceaselessly against her bonds. </p>\r\n<p>In keeping with his story of being one who makes his life trapping, Velkaan rose well before dawn. Going down to the river he managed to snag a lazy fish or two, hiding under a ledge the water had cut in its bank. The fish were not very big but would at least be welcoming hot in her companions’ cold and empty stomachs. Alyse saw him returning and got some herbs from her pack to put in the water he set to boil. The smell woke those still sleeping and brought Gregos in from where he had been patrolling, to enjoy a voluble meal during which Alyse finally conceded that Velkaan was a perfectly capable guide and that Palach and U''min were quite capable of looking after themselves and did not need Cymon to accompany them to Talgheer. Nor even Yushok, should the wily A''mathan (whom Alyse knew had deliberately disappeared as soon as the discussion had begun for exactly this reason and she was of course perfectly correct) deign to re-surface before their departure. So they finished their meal, shared out their scant provisions, said their goodbyes and set out their separate ways.</p>\r\n<p>Day after day the dark clouds above impressed their gloomy presence upon all below, until even the pristine carpet of white snow took on a dreary tarnish of dismal grey. Alyse and her companions trudged on through a sombre world that seemed lost and abandoned by all but the four lone travellers and their horses &mdash; a world in which nothing stirred but their weary feet and anxious thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>Gregos worried about Palach and U''min and about their kinsmen and whether any of them would arrive in time to make a difference and indeed, what possible difference the four of them could make anyway if so many were already struggling to stand.</p>\r\n<p>Torje too, wondered about this but he was also concerned that Kaan had made no mention of the Fellis at all. The others had not seemed to notice this omission and he had not thought it fair to bring it up when they all had so many other worries on their minds. So he wrestled with this particular anxiety alone.</p>\r\n<p>Cymon worried most about Alyse. Ever since they had parted company with the others, she had seemed to turn in upon herself. Every day she withdrew deeper until she did not speak at all, other than in monosyllables when asked a direct question... and that reluctantly. Even in the silence of their mental link he was unable to reach her. When he had tried, he had felt the great iron weight of her will close him out. Like the heavy, clanking bang of a castle dungeon, he had heard the door slam shut and the ringing thud as the bolts were driven home. Hurt, frustrated and doubly anxious as to the state of her mind, he had retreated and not tried again. All he could do was watch and wait... and continue to worry.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse did her best to ignore his anxious glances and the pained expression on his face. She knew she had hurt him, as she had hurt herself with the crippling pangs of self-inflicted aloneness, but she done it for his own good. The rising turmoil of her mind was such that that she dared not let him in for his own sanity. For if she felt his tender touch in her present unrest, she knew she would be tempted to lean too far and swamp him with the enormity of the consciousness she now possessed and which his mortal frame could not comprehend. But a greater reason lay in the fact that each passing league that brought them closer to Symtar, also brought her closer to her final journey to Ak''thai and the reality loomed ever more vivid that she was no match for Duman. Whatever hopes and illusions Cymon tried to instil within her, she knew their cause was hopeless but for his sake she had tried to keep up the pretence. She knew, that if she let him in now, she would no longer to be able to keep her true feelings from him and she could not put him through that. To have to let her go without hope... he would not do it. He would insist on dying at her side and she could not put herself through that, for she knew what pleasure it would give Duman to make Cymon’s death slow and painful for them both. For her own sanity she pushed these thoughts into the darkest recesses of her mind, though it was a hard and continuous effort, and concentrated instead upon her concerns for everyone else within the dream world of Cymon’s optimistic vision of victory. And she grew increasingly concerned and upset about the little white mare.</p>\r\n<p>Though all of their concerns were genuine, they were nonetheless negative emotions which both stimulated and fed the stalking Shadow trapped within the mare and raised its drooping head from the dank misery of the clouded and shadow-less land that made it impossible to attain its most treasured desire... Alyse. That did not have to stop it from amusing itself however and so it allowed its dark and evil nature to seep out and spread its contamination insidiously amongst those around it. So what had started as a companionable, if self-absorbed, silence gradually became twisted into an unpleasant and tense lack of speaking that aggravated minds, provoked tempers and strained friendships. </p>\r\n<p>But the Shadows'' meddling was not without cost and soon its efforts began to take their toll on its unwilling host. The mares'' eyes dulled to pale, spiritless glass in her drooping head and her tongue hung, thick and dry from the side of her mouth. Her coat lost its lustre, became drab, matted and unkempt, with bald, flaky patches and red sores. Her hooves cracked and she grew lame, limping painfully, and the frosty breath that blew noisily from her rasping chest came rank and foul over blackening teeth. She was dying &mdash; the Shadow’s exertions adding to its already draining presence on her life force.</p>\r\n<p>From his vantage point to the south (where he had been riding a parallel course), Jarok was also growing increasingly anxious about the mares'' condition but for different reasons. It was obvious that she could not last much longer. She had deteriorated rapidly even over the short space of the afternoon and if she did not fall of her own accord, Cymon and probably even Alyse, would most certainly insist that she be put out of her misery. And this put them all in danger. For if the Shadow could not have Alyse, it would surely take whomever came near rather than let her out of its grasp. Jarok knew he could not take the risk. The time had come. </p>\r\n<p>Closing his eyes, he let his Mother’s nature reach out until it found Royle and drew the A''mathan to him. He winged gracefully to the ground beside Jarok. The air shimmered and Yushok gazed up at his studied face with troubled eyes. He did not have to be a genius to know he was not going to like what Jarok had to say but he underestimated how much.</p>\r\n<p>"You must go back and make Cymon let Alyse tend the mare," said Jarok flatly, coming straight to the point.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you crazy?" Yushok exclaimed incredulously, after his heart had resumed beating. </p>\r\n<p>"It is time." </p>\r\n<p>For a moment Yushok could only gawp at the blank face devoid of all emotion except for the tiny twitch in the corner of one eye. He could not believe that Jarok meant what he was saying. But if he did not, it was a sour jest. Then his anger burst through.</p>\r\n<p>"Time for what?" he hissed through gritted teeth. "Murder? Betrayal? Mass insanity? Isn''t that why we''re here in the first place?" He took a steadying breath and went on more calmly. "You can''t mean what you''re saying Jarok. You know what will happen if she goes near that thing." His questioning statement came out on a pleading whisper.</p>\r\n<p>"I know," replied Jarok and his eyes were deep hollows of self-recrimination, scored through with fatal inevitability, as he slowly turned his head away from Alyse’s tiny form in the distance to gaze at the A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>"Then why?" asked Yushok, not bothering to hide the desperation that he felt. "In the Mother’s name, why? She has barely a hope against Duman as it is... with that thing inside her even that is lost."</p>\r\n<p>"Because some trees must be felled for the good of the forest."</p>\r\n<p>The cryptic answer infuriated the A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>"And what''s that supposed to mean?" he snapped, his long plait swinging methodically back and forth like the tail of his alter ego.</p>\r\n<p>As the incoming tide of a mighty sea, Jarok’s anger flooded over the dry sands of his banked sorrow and grief, filling the earthy darkness of his eyes with golden fire and flaming ice. He stared down at Yushok with such profound agony for them both, that suddenly Yushok did not want hear the answer that fell with resounding truth upon his ears.</p>\r\n<p>"It means," said Jarok bitterly, "that it''s time to finish what you started."</p>\r\n<p>"What I started?" Yushok repeated in gasped denial and then the high spots of anger in his cheeks drained away as Jarok went on to twist the knife of accusation he had just plunged into his belly.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes. You! For wasn''t it you that gave Alyse the ''Eye''...? </p>\r\n<p>Wasn''t it you, that urged her to look deep inside. So deep that her own touched its cold surface and released it’s molten Power into her mortal body...? </p>\r\n<p>And wasn''t it you, who gave it to Sh''ailon before her...? </p>\r\n<p>Sh''ailon, who knew that only death awaited her on it’s taking...? </p>\r\n<p>Wasn''t it you, A''mathan...? </p>\r\n<p>Wasn''t it...?" he demanded fiercely.</p>\r\n<p>Every word of every question fell low and terrible upon the A’mathan. Securing itself to Yushok’s spirit and dragging him under vast waters of guilt and blame. He struggled to the surface, issuing fierce words of denial that chimed discordant notes even to his own ears.</p>\r\n<p>"I only did as I was bid, for the return of Ecos, for the freedom of his brothers, for the good of Earth. </p>\r\n<p>Not for Alyse to be sacrificed like some fattened sheep. I..."</p>\r\n<p>His words were choked by Jarok’s humourless laughter and bitter gall rose in his throat, dragging out his tear-sodden heart and shredding it mercilessly as clarity tore the veil from his eyes. The flower of love and respect for the Dragons that he had cherished and nurtured down the centuries, their precious friendship, for which he would willingly have given his life and for which he had worked faithfully, diligently and with single-minded devotion. Never questioning. Never faulting. That flower suddenly withered and he felt used, his friendship cheapened, his devotion soiled, his love nothing more than a tool with which to make him a pawn in their game.</p>\r\n<p>"How different are they than Duman?" Yushok’s anguish raged and boiled over. "How less hateful their betrayal?" </p>\r\n<p>As quickly as it had risen his anger was spent. Tired and weary in body and spirit, he dropped, cross-legged, to the ground, the tears he so desperately desired as dried up and useless as his broken heart. Jarok looked down at the bowed head and trembling chin of Yushok with pity and inside himself with shame and disgust. He had had no right to let loose with his selfish tirade and rob the A''mathan of all he had held dear. He did not know if he could undo the damage he had done but he had to try. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry for taking my pain out on you Yushok," he said softly, kneeling down beside him and placing a hand on his arm, so that the A''mathan might look at him and see the sincerity of his remorse. "That was Alyse’s little brother talking. Please, forgive me. The Dragons didn''t betray you, not really. My father did not intentionally plan it this way. When he allowed the brothers to lead you to the ''Eye'' it was meant only for Sh''ailon... for me. Duman found her too quickly and so I was born too soon and grew too slowly, otherwise things would have been different. But such are the ways of Fate. Ignorant of my existence, my uncles'' perceived only failure and in their desperation could only try again. The moment the joining was complete, Alyse became aware of who I was and knew that the final confrontation was never her destiny. Once Duman had focused on her, she decided to act as decoy, to buy time for my maturing. But she did not know just how far that role would take her. Not even Ecos knew that, even if they did not believe me lost, this moment would still have come." He nodded as Yushok’s eyes widened in surprise. "I have tried to think of another way. To spare her having to make the ultimate sacrifice but now I realise she cannot escape her fate, any more than I can escape my destiny. </p>\r\n<p>If anyone is to blame...if anyone is at fault...if anyone has failed...it is me. </p>\r\n<p>I''ve failed Alyse and I''ve failed you and I''ve dishonoured us both by trying to pass the blame onto your shoulders. Can you forgive me?"</p>\r\n<p>Yushok reached out and patted his hand, a sad smile easing away the numbness in his eyes and his heart.</p>\r\n<p>"For what? Loving too much?" he whispered softly. "I fear we are both guilty of that. But promise me one thing... "</p>\r\n<p>"If it''s within my power it shall be yours," Jarok did not hesitate.</p>\r\n<p>"You are Power Reborn." There was no wonder or awe in Yushok’s voice, only a calm resolve. "You can do anything you want. So, if you can''t save Alyse... then, when this is all over, promise that by Power or sword, you will take my life as well &mdash; for I will not live without her. I''m not asking this to add to your burden, or to punish you by some twisted means of revenge. I''ve lived a life far longer than was meant and I would rather be with her than with anyone else... No offence," he shot Jarok a rueful grin.</p>\r\n<p>"None taken. You have my word on it," Jarok held out his hand.</p>\r\n<p>Yushok looked at it, then leaned forward and hugged him tightly.</p>\r\n<p>"Now I''d better go," he said gruffly and jumped to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>In a shivering rush of wind he rose aloft on falcons'' wings and circled once before speeding to be done with his unwanted task. Far below he spotted Defiant and arcing his wings, swooped down in a headlong dive and with reckless abandon, transformed mid-air to land astride the horses'' rump. Defiant snorted disapprovingly. </p>\r\n<p>"I''ve had a bad day," muttered Yushok, shifting into a more comfortable position. "You too?" he asked, as Defiant pawed snow and tossed his head. Yushok scratched his neck in compensation, wishing his own troubles could be so easily smoothed away.</p>\r\n<p>The tension from the camp was so palpable it made Yushok’s scalp itch as he watched from the darkness, unsure of how to accomplish what Jarok desired. The groups'' mood had worsened considerably while he had been away, he noted. Each of them sat wrapped in melancholic isolation, gloomy faces staring listlessly into a half-hearted fire that licked without hunger at the damp kindling, belching black puffs of smoky indigestion as it tried to consume the unpalatable offerings set before it. </p>\r\n<p>As on previous nights Cymon took first watch, setting himself between Alyse and mare. Alyse glared at him sourly but to her credit, made no attempt to use her Power. It would have been so easy to enhance her companions'' desire for sleep and slip away to tend to the creature, but she had made a promise and stood by it, albeit reluctantly and at great cost to her emotional strain. As soon as the others had drifted into sleep, Yushok trod softly towards Cymon, calling out his name in an advanced whisper.</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok!" The elf’s eyes brightened to see the A''mathan but then his face grew stern and he hissed quietly. "Where have you been? The others have been going frantic and I could''ve done with some support against Alyse."</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve been about," Yushok replied vaguely. "This can''t go on, Cymon."</p>\r\n<p>"I won''t let her use her Power," insisted Cymon angrily, knowing exactly what Yushok was referring to. "It''s too dangerous with whatever is following who knows where."</p>\r\n<p>"I agree. It''s very dangerous." Yushok almost choked on the words, knowing he was twisting the truth, and was glad of the night that hid his flaming guilt at what he was about to do. He hated deceiving the elf as much he loathed the task set before him and telling himself that he had no other option, or that it was for the greater good, did nothing to assuage his shame or his self-disgust. He swallowed and stepped closer. </p>\r\n<p>"But we have to let Alyse close enough to see what must be done. The mare must be set free."</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''ll do it now and tell her later," said Cymon standing up and drawing his sword. Yushok stood in his way.</p>\r\n<p>"You can''t. If you do it will cause a rift between the two of you that might never heal. You know that... that''s why you haven''t done it sooner. And Alyse won''t agree to it until she has thoroughly checked the mare herself." </p>\r\n<p>"We dare not let Alyse near her," Cymon shook his head &mdash; his anxious tone an even match for his puzzled frown. "Each time, the mare loses control. She rears and snaps. It''s almost as though the mare herself is trying to warn Alyse off. I confess, I''ve never seen a horse act so strangely... nor Alyse come to that. She''s completely shut me out. Even the others seem different somehow, though I can''t say for sure... I haven''t really known them long enough." He sat back down, tiredly rubbing the dark rings circling his troubled eyes. "I''m almost at my wits end," he admitted in heavy tones. "I hate arguing with Alyse, but I''m only doing it for her protection. Why does she have to be so stubborn about it?" he snapped wearily and thrust his sword into the ground between his feet.</p>\r\n<p>Yushok gazed down at him sadly and hated himself anew as he laid a gentle hand on his shoulder and pointed to the mare. Her head hung so low she might have been grazing but she was not and as she shifted to change legs she stumbled, staggering to retain her footing. Her pain-filled whinny drifted pitifully into the night.</p>\r\n<p>"Look at her," said Yushok. "She''s so weak she can barely stand. It won''t take much to get her to the ground and the rest of us can hold her down while Alyse examines her."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon gazed at the sorrowful sight of her suffering then bent forward, grasping the blade of his sword in both hands and resting his forehead against the pommel. He closed his eyes and sat very still, listening to heavy sounds of his own breathing. At last he jumped up, sheathed his sword and nodded.</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s get the others and get this over with."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse did know whether to be happy or sad as she walked with Cymon and the others to where the mare was tied &mdash; happy because at last Cymon had allowed her to tend to the creature. Sad because she knew that she could use her Power to heal her but that without it there was really nothing she could do. Oh, she could make poultices and pain-relieving drinks but they would do little more than prolong the mares'' suffering. She tried to be angry with Cymon for leaving it so late but she failed. Deep down she knew he was only trying to protect her and she could not fault him for that. The mare went down without resistance and Alyse moved to sit by her head, pushing back her sweaty forelock and mane to rub her hands gently over the pathetically thin head and neck. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p>\r\n<p>A cold chill swept over Cymon’s heart. The mares'' tail swished in agitation and her eyes rolled, the way Defiant’s sometimes did when there was danger about. Beside him, he felt Yushok trembling. Heard the A''mathan muttering softly to himself under his breath. He saw him lift the brand he was carrying, saw the flames splutter as his hand shook. Watched as the mares'' eyes brightened in triumph with their light. </p>\r\n<p>Something was wrong! </p>\r\n<p>The words fairly screamed into Cymon’s mind. He grabbed Yushok’s wrist.</p>\r\n<p>"What are you doing?" he hissed through clenched teeth.</p>\r\n<p>"What needs to be done? Trust me."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon froze.</p>\r\n<p>"Thou wouldst do what needeth to be done. Trust me." </p>\r\n<p>The two stood with locked gaze as the message given him on the day of his premonition confirmed, with mournful inevitability, the words of the A''mathan. Cymon’s grip tightened. For a moment he resisted, refusing to allow what words and Yushok’s eyes confirmed must be. And then those eyes filled with so much pain, Cymon marvelled that the ancient elf could bear it.</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok, I need more light."</p>\r\n<p>Cymon choked back the cry of his shattering heart and released Yushok’s wrist. Turning away, he took his burning tears silently into the darkness. Yushok watched him go with mixed pity and envy, then thrust the brand closer to Alyse. </p>\r\n<p>Everything else faded away and he was locked in a nightmare where only Alyse, the mare and the bright, yellow glow of the flaming torch existed. Nausea churned its way up from his stomach to burn his throat and tongue, as two dark stains leaked onto the white snow like black blood. He forced himself to keep his eyes open, to not turn away from the horror of his treachery, and bit his tongue to stop it from crying out. He saw Alyse’s hand come up to rest upon the mares'' muzzle. Watched her shadowy arm innocently mimic the gesture. His spirit beat with despair upon his flesh as the two shadows crossed. </p>\r\n<p>He must cry out! Tell her to stop! Warn her!</p>\r\n<p>"Some trees must be felled for the good of the forest."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s voice echoed in his mind, each word an invisible stitch sealing his lips. </p>\r\n<p>And then it was too late! </p>\r\n<p>Afterwards, he did not know whether he had truly seen the darker shape of the Shadow ooze, like honey squeezed through muslin, from one patch of shadow to the other or whether he had just imagined it in his guilt. But when the mare exhaled in a soft sigh and her chest stilled to raise no more, he knew the deed was done. He turned away, unable to look at his companions for fear they see the truth in his face. From far off came the first yowling strains of a lone wolf. Its cry lengthened into a deep-throated howl that rose in an eerie melody and was taken up by another, then another, until the whole pack was joined in a spine-tingling sorrowful lament. Their song paused, and then began again &mdash; closer this time.</p>\r\n<p>"We shouldst burn the body," Torje was saying quietly.</p>\r\n<p>"No." Yushok snapped himself out of his self-pitying absorption and shook his head. "Listen. Already the mare has told the wolves where she lies. By her flesh, the bitch may survive the winter to bear young in the spring. It is the mare’s gift to the Mother &mdash; to honour Her and to thank Her for the gift of her life. We must leave her here for them. It''s all we can do for her now."</p>\r\n<p>He left them then. Striding to where Defiant stood a few paces away and leaping, alighted on soft pads to curl tightly upon the horses'' rump. Sensing his need for comfort, Defiant flicked his tail gently over Royale’s shivering body.</p>\r\n<p>Royle did not sleep. But neither did he stir when Alyse’s hands lifted him down onto the ground and in the morning, he feigned surprise and ignorance when Cymon cried out her name and questioned everyone as to where she had gone. Only to himself did he whisper.</p>\r\n<p>"Its taking her home... home to Ak''thai."</p>\r\n<p>And if cats could cry, he would have wept a lake.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 25, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(46, 'Home to Akthai', 'CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="A" src="A.gif">s Yushok moved the light to one side the two, newly merged shadows withdrew into Alyse’s solid frame and in a heartbeat Duman’s final spell was activated. Alyse had already drawn her barriers tightly about her and so she had no time within the fraction of the second she was given, to react. Not that she would have been able to do much other than what the spell itself desired, to block off all access to the Power. And so, with whiplash speed the binding was cast. The avenues and doors of the astro-dimensional plane were slammed shut and bolted from the outside, locking Alyse firmly within the prison of her own psyche. The more she thrust and tested the mystic chains that held her, the tighter they became, squeezing and shrinking the confines of her imprisonment until she screamed for it to stop.<p></p>\r\n<p>She felt herself stand. She saw the mare, sucked lifeless. She saw Gregos and Torje. She caught sight of Cymon hunched by the campfire. Turning, she gazed into the pained eyes of Yushok. From out of the darkness came the cry of wolves, then the sound of Yushok’s sad voice. But it was all second-hand sensing &mdash; as though she were looking over another’s'' shoulder, or listening through a closed door to the muffled and slurred speech of those outside. Then she was moving. Her feet placing themselves one in front of the other but she had no consciousness of the movement. It was as though she were a puppet under something else control and she was just carried along... a parasite in her own body. Sick and angry, she banged anew on the bars of her mystical cage. And when she did, all her nightmares rushed to the fore as from down the endless corridors came the chilling, triumphant laughter of Duman.</p>\r\n<p>Duman had been working in his Casting Room when the first, telltale, muscular spasms had jerked his attention away from the bowl of powders in his hand and sent it crashing to the floor. His arm swept the room as his rushed murmurs nullified the half-cast spell he had been attempting, sending un-focused energies scattering in a series of popping jars, flying utensils and sizzling sparks of charged light, flashing from item to item across the table then down through the wood to earth, in a bright flash, through the powder at his feet. With no more than ''tut'' at the mess left behind (after what had really been quite a reckless and dangerous act of haste) Duman rushed from the room on feet that had suddenly taken flight and whisked up the stairs and along the corridors to the Summoning Chamber, with no more than the tips of his toes touching stone. </p>\r\n<p>By now every stone and chip of rock in the fortress was positively humming as it responded to his ecstasy of excitement. The chamber door swung open and closed behind him as he danced a gleeful jig around the ebony table, his black robe swirling about his ankles, his arms waving time to the beat of his tuneful whistle. Round and round he twirled and leapt and skipped, singing rhyme-less ditties of egotistical nonsense, while his near-hysterical joy carried him to the very edge of madness. </p>\r\n<p>Resting on its tripod, the Orb vibrated in ever widening, resonant pulses, that swept outwards until they touched the barriers of the pentagram that contained it and which were themselves vibrating, in marbled patterns of black and blood-red, through the table and into the chair tucked under it, sending it spinning across the room. Duman’s celebrations skidded to a halt as it crashed noisily into the heavy door. Deep, regular breaths brought his racing emotions, and his wits, back to an acceptable level &mdash; his force of will was doing the same for his concentration. He lifted his hand, palm outward, and swept it slowly towards the table. The chair responded in a long, drawn-out screech back across the room, flicked upright and came to rest with its back against his palm. He sat down, hitched up to the table, calmed the last of his wayward thoughts and began the ritual of Summoning.</p>\r\n<p>In a flux of colour ranging from palest cornflower to deepest midnight Tareb filled the Orb, spiralling outward from the centre to lick the inner surface and disperse into an indigo mist.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re in a sour mood today," remarked Duman as he observed the dull violet of Tareb’s natural hue.</p>\r\n<p>"Tis only thine overt jubilation that doth make me appear so," denied Tareb, swirling the mist to a vibrant azure.</p>\r\n<p>"Whatever," answered Duman absently and began siphoning off Tareb’s Power. He was in too good a mood to argue.</p>\r\n<p>Removing his right hand from the Orb he scored the air with the rune of Scymar... the Thinker, at the same time chanting a firm incantation to summon Scymar’s presence into it. He repeated the process, this time calling Teqpa... the Toucher. The blue-traced runes turned crimson and began to strain against his hold and each other. Slowly, Duman crossed his middle finger over his forefinger. Teqpa moved reluctantly, until the three prongs that arced downwards from its centre-back locked into the horizontal bar that jutted from the top of the rune of Scymar. Duman closed his fist and rotated it carefully to the left. Teqpa leaned with the motion, so that its back rested upon the top of Scymar. In low, deliberate tones, Duman spoke the words of the incantation that would merge the two, adding at the end of each line a command from a binding spell. As the last word left his lips, he threw open his fist and the whole was engulfed in blue fire. He waited until only a single flame remained and, at that spot, dug his fingers into the newly constructed rune.</p>\r\n<p>A million theories and possibilities buffeted his mind like a tropical storm. His potent greed for knowledge almost overwhelmed him but somehow, he managed to force it aside and concentrate on his immediate needs.&nbsp;He ''touched'' the desire uppermost in his mind, which was how to reach the Shadow through the restrictions imposed upon him by the Black Ones. The three-pronged fingers of Teqpa, poked and probed the rich and intricate maze of knowledge in search of the answer. A slow sneer stretched the corner of Duman’s mouth as he repeated the incantation for the Rite of Passage. Every corner of Ak''thai rumbled and screamed, in cursing outrage, at his audacious and blatant disobedience. Duman merely laughed dismissively.</p>\r\n<p>He opened his eyes onto a black and white world devoid of colour. And yet it was not colourless. For in between the stark contrast of the two, was an incredible array of variant greys, full of life and vigour and unsuspected beauty. In front of him, the shaded, off-white head of Defiant rose and fell rhythmically to the drumming of his hooves and in front of him. The shadow-tinted horizon heralded the approach of dawn. Since there was very little else to see, except for the scant clumps of dead twigs and the occasional bare tree, Duman closed his eyes again and delved inward. The mind of the Shadow was a murky, sluggish reflection of his own. It was well aware that its present existence was ruled by other than its own will but was willing to accept the situation without resistance for the promised reward of freedom. </p>\r\n<p>More impatient than ever, now that his desire was all but in his grasp, Duman implanted an increased sense of urgency within the Shadow. The physical condition of its host was of minor importance, other than she still breathed when it got here. All else was secondary. The Shadow was not to waste time resting beasts but to pick up fresh horses whenever the chance arose and ride, without pause, to Ak''thai. He felt the Shadow acquiesce and, after a quick check to ensure the binding spell had not been tampered with or damaged, (though he knew it was impossible for Alyse to do so since the Dragon knew nothing of the Art of magic) he withdrew. </p>\r\n<p>Once more in his own body in the Summoning Chamber, Duman pulled his fingers free of the rune he had created. After dividing and dismissing the two runes, he released Tareb from the Orb and, shouting for Kretos at the top of his voice the whole time, made his way to his Casting Room to fetch his Book of Spells. Still calling for Kretos, he left by the long route and stopped in various rooms on the way to his tower, to pick up parchment, quills and extra ink. He had preparations to make.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos dallied as long as he dared before answering Duman’s summons. He was nervous and unsettled and that was not a healthy condition in which to appear in Duman’s presence. The wizard’s joyous mood had been rebounding throughout the fortress since early morning. Irritating and tedious, the continuous ''throbbing'' of the sensitive stone had become like a second heartbeat, jarring every nerve and bone in his body with each echoing pulse. He paused outside the tower room, licking his dry lips and calming his thoughts. He could hear Duman inside, singing in tuneless, bland monotones without rhythm or pitch. Kretos grit his teeth and slunk into the shadows of the room. </p>\r\n<p>Duman was bent over the table engrossed in his work. He was scribbling furiously, on one of the parchments strewn in front of him, from the thick book propped open against a heavy candlestick, whose single candle provided the only light in the room. He turned the page, squinting in concentration as his eyes followed the scrapping nail over the ancient scrawl. He muttered his way through several pages before he threw down his quill with an exasperated sigh and leant back in his chair, rubbing his strained eyes with the heel of his palms and mumbling to himself about leaving things to the last moment. Kretos took a step closer and coughed lightly, steeling himself as Duman’s eyes snapped open.</p>\r\n<p>"There you are! Good. Good." Duman’s genuine smile took Kretos completely by surprise but the wizard seemed not to notice either one. "I''m looking for a scroll. About... so long... " he stretched his hands apart, "... with black string tied around it. Have you seen it?"</p>\r\n<p>Kretos flicked his eyes quickly across the table.</p>\r\n<p>"Th... this one M... m... master?" he stammered, pulling the mislaid scroll from where it had become wedged, between the spine of the book and the candlestick.</p>\r\n<p>"Excellent! Excellent! That''s the one. Thank you," cried Duman, his smile stretching even further, to lift the corners of his eyes, as he retrieved the scroll from a shaking hand and returned to his writings as if Kretos was not there.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos did not know what to do. His stomach was heaving cartwheels and his usually precise mind was practising juggling with his confused thoughts and nervous emotions. The wizard must surely be playing some kind of trick, a test of some sort. He cringed low and started to turn, then hesitated. Perhaps that was the wrong response. It was impossible to tell since it was usually the gleam in the wizard’s eyes that he relied upon to let him know what response was needed and right now the wizards eyes were hidden, locked down low upon the unrolled scroll behind the book. He shifted nervously, trying to decide whether to stay or go, chewing on the knuckles of his hand as he peered anxiously through the greasy fringe hanging over his face. This strange, absent behaviour was an unknown element in Duman’s character and Kretos did not like it all. The game he played, his very life, depended on his intimate knowledge of the wizard’s ways and he had no experience of how to deal with this one. He seemed like a completely different person, almost agreeable, a fact that Kretos found extremely distressing and unsettling, as it threatened to suck away at the marrow of hatred of his bone. It''s only an act, he told himself angrily, find out what he wants and get out of here! He lifted his head, watching the wizard warily.</p>\r\n<p>"Did... er... was there... em... should I?" he faltered, pointing hesitantly at the door.</p>\r\n<p>"Eh?" Duman looked up, his eyes blinking rapidly as they focused across the table.</p>\r\n<p>"W... w... was there any... anything else M... m... master?" He managed to choke out.</p>\r\n<p>"What? Oh... yes, yes. I need some things from the bogs &mdash; an Ukkas stem, a vial of rising bog-gas. Some reed root... four good clumps should do I think and a skim of... its all on the list. Where is the damn thing?" Duman rummaged through the mess scattered around him. "Ah! Here it is. Take whatever you want from over there," he waved vaguely towards the opposite side of the room and then delved back into his studies.</p>\r\n<p>Kretos retrieved the list, which had fluttered from Duman’s loose fingers to the floor. Then he crept quietly to the corner, flicked his eyes down the list, picked up everything he would need and slipped out of the room, all the while keeping one eye on the wizard for any movement. He closed the door quietly behind him and leaned against it &mdash; unable to believe he had actually made it out unscathed.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after he was trudging through the bogs, up to his knees in muck and slime. As always the stinking, dreary mass of sludge land brought out every miserable and resentful thought he possessed. Even the slurping company of his cousins, the bog-rats, ducking and diving happily in the gunge they called home, could not lift his dark mood. He grumbled incessantly as he continued his searched for the Ukkas, which was proving aggravatingly elusive. Tired and fed-up, he dragged himself onto a patch of semi-dry land to take a break. Pulling up a handful of grass to wipe some of the filth off his feet, he at last found what he was looking for. Hidden amidst the clump of grass was a solitary Ukkas plant. Getting to his knees he pulled up the plant and snapped off the roots. Then taking out his knife, he sat down to strip off the leaves. He was halfway down one side when his face fell. With a shouted curse he flung the plant to the ground. It was riddled with red-spot!</p>\r\n<p>"Useless,” he spat aloud in disgust.&nbsp;He cast his eyes about the dimming landscape. It was getting dark. Soon he would not be able to see a thing and he had forgotten to bring a lantern. Not that it mattered. Judging by the time it had taken to find this one, his chances of spotting another now were next to nothing... which meant he would be forced to spend the night out here, for he dared not go back without the Ukkas. He stabbed viciously at the ground with his knife. He hated this place at the best of times but at night, with no lantern, no blanket and no food, it was like a nightmare come true. Perhaps he could sneak back into the pens and creep out again first thing in the morning? He rubbed the stump of his severed tail and decided not to take the risk. There was no guarantee Duman was still of a good mood. </p>\r\n<p>He dragged the sack containing the other items towards him, to use as a pillow as he lay down. Idly he picked up the scattered leaves and began shredding them into tiny pieces to ease his frustration. Then he noticed that not all the leaves were spotted. In fact, (he realised, scooping up and checking a handful) there were more not than were. He sat up quickly and grabbed the discarded plant, turning it over and around, examining it carefully. There was not a single spot on the stem itself. A sly grin spread out from the corner of his mouth. </p>\r\n<p>''It''s still no good,'' the voice of caution reminded him. </p>\r\n<p>"He would never know," he replied aloud.</p>\r\n<p>''The spell he is working on must be very important to absorb him so deeply as to completely change his personality,'' said the voice. ''The inclusion of a diseased component might ruin it.''</p>\r\n<p>"You''re absolutely right. It would ruin his spell." And then he laughed with wicked delight. "In fact, the effects of the uncalculated addition of an unknown element might be disastrous... even fatal," he finished on a hopeful tone. </p>\r\n<p>His eyes sparkled as they glanced up from the plant to the faint orange glow from the tower window and with a sadistic sneer that Duman himself would have been proud of, Kretos began stripping the remaining leaves. When he was done, he checked and re-checked the stem for even a single spot that would betray him and finding none, put it into the sack. Gathering up all the evidence he pushed it deep into the bog. Once he was satisfied that none of it would rise again, he swung the sack over his shoulder and made his way back to the fortress, humming a happy tune.</p>\r\n<p>Duman worked tirelessly &mdash; excitement and elation providing food for his stamina. He figured, configured and re-configured every word, syllable and nuance... every powder, component, sign and rune... determined, to eliminate the flaw he had found in his previous re-calculation of the original spell with which he had imprisoned the Dragons in the Orbs. The error had suddenly occurred to him as he released Tareb earlier. The Dragons were mighty creatures and the force that had been necessary for their transportation would rip the girls'' human frame to shreds, if she did not go up in flames first! He had to find a way to lessen the force without compromising the strength of energies. </p>\r\n<p>''Impossible,'' his knowledge told him. </p>\r\n<p>''There''s always a way to make the impossible...&nbsp;possible. It''s simply a matter of finding it,'' replied his arrogance.</p>\r\n<p>So he went through the book and parchments again... and again... and again. </p>\r\n<p>He considered superimposing a shielding spell, but that would prevent the actions of all that followed &mdash; a healing spell, to counteract any damage as it occurred. But even a healing spell needed time to work and by then it might be too late &mdash; a suspension spell that would freeze her metabolism. But he could not guarantee being able to counteract it through the Orb’s barriers. </p>\r\n<p>He investigated possible new combinations of runes, ones that he had never tried before but his calculations (as to how they would react with or against each other) always ended with negative results. </p>\r\n<a name="Runes"></a>\r\n<center>\r\n<a href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Runes" src="Runes01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>With a loud curse he slammed the book shut. The candlestick wobbled precariously, spilling hot wax upon the front cover. Duman lounged back in his chair, waiting for it to cool and harden before cleaning it off. He closed his eyes and shut down his mind and let himself drift in darkness, trying to forget his problem in the hope that (as is often the case) the answer would reveal itself. All he found was more darkness. He got up and paced the room, stretching stiff and aching limbs and rolling the tension from his neck. He poured himself a goblet of wine and cut a slice of meat from the dried up carcass sitting next to it and went back to his chair. Biting into the meat, he picked at the lump of wax on his book. Small, black chips fell onto the white parchment and he began pushing them around absently with a fingernail. He swallowed quickly and threw the rest of the meat to floor as something about the black and white pattern caught his attention. He peered closer. There was definitely something. It was on the tip of his tongue but he just could not say what it was. He banged the table in frustration. Wine slopped over the top of the goblet. Muttering curses for wasted work, he dabbed at the mess with his sleeve and separated the pieces of parchment to dry. And in the bottom left-hand corner of one... he saw it. The same symbol that he had doodled with the wax! His eyes brightened and his dry mouth moistened with the sweet taste of success. Picking up his quill he began to trace the drawing onto his workings, wondering as he did so how he could have been so stupid not to figure it out before. Because, he realised, it would never had occurred to him that such sheer simplicity could have been the answer to so complex a puzzle. His quill scraped eagerly against the parchment as he resumed his configurations. </p>\r\n<p>The Mother’s circle drawn concentrically five times, the first and smallest, representing the Elfin, who were the first to be created, and so on through to Man, the fifth and last. He marked an upward pointing arrow to denote that this was the Race from which the subject of his casting, Alyse, was born. Into this symbol he then merged the original Draconian symbol that represented the Power she possessed. He raised his head. There was something still not quite right, he mused, chewing on the end of his quill as he frowned down at his markings. He stared into the candles'' flame searching for inspiration. It flickered under his breath and puffed out. He snapped his fingers and it flared back to life.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course,” he exclaimed, and in the centre of the circles he set a black flame, the symbol of the Life fire, to give it strength and so equal the balance between the two.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, he wrote the names of each above the symbols. </p>\r\n<p>Kyimath; Draacun; Kyidra-vii. </p>\r\n<p>Placing the final dot with a satisfied tap of his quill, he leant back. Arms behind his head and feet perched on the edge of the table, he grinned ecstatically. The only thing left to do was to measure the powders and liquids, count and prepare the solid components, set everything in place in the Casting Room and last, but not least, cast a cleansing spell to rid the room of all leftover and superfluous energies hanging about that might interfere. But these things would not take long and he decided he had plenty of time to spare for a well-earned nap before he need get started. He finished off his wine, moved over to his couch and settled into sleep. His relaxed face softened and smiled smugly with the delicious dreams that played out the culmination of his life’s'' desires.</p>\r\n<p>Far to the north, the main object of his dreams was growing ever impatient with Defiant’s ceaseless rebellion. It was frustrating, for the horse still had a lot left in him but no matter how firm or spiteful the persuasion, the Shadow could not lift it above a canter and the host was growing tired from the constant efforts to keep it under control. Alyse’s hands jerked on the reins and turned Defiant’s head towards the smoking chimneys of Newhope and a fresh mount. There was little choice but the Shadow took the best it could find. A leggy, bay mare with a white splash across her muzzle that it galloped until she dropped exhausted by the trail. All that afternoon it walked, stopping only to quench the thirst of its flagging host in a small rivulet, tipping through a rocky hillside, before pressing on through the frozen night. Next day it sighted a neglected farm. Unfortunately for the vagabonds hiding there, they chose to attack it. Though its host was small and slight of frame, the Shadow possessed ample knowledge and skills to disarm one of the three, a skinny youth with a scar running the length of his nose, and quickly dispatched them all. Their horses were scrawny and ill-kept but lasted long enough to get it to the next village of Midden, where it managed to pick up a large shire that was tied outside the blacksmiths waiting to be re-shod. The beast was slow and lumbering but contained enormous stamina in his massive bodyweight. League after league the great horse plodded onwards; down through Middle Province and well into Ansuk, he carried the Shadow and its host before his bursting heart silenced his laboured breathing. </p>\r\n<p>Once more on foot, the Shadow sought habitation and the beasts to be found there. And thus, from beast to foot and foot to beast, the Shadow moved inexorably across the land using any means of transport open to it. Horse, donkey, cow or foot it travelled with relentless single-mindedness, to the stone causeway that joined Ansuk to Duman’s domain. There it paused to gaze upon the final leg of its journey. The final strides that would take it across Windstone Ravine then passed the towering Dragons that guarded the doors of Runic Ak''thai and up the last few steps to free existence.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<a name="RunicAkthai" href="00000054.htm"><img border="0" alt="Runic Ak''thai" src="RunicAkthai01.jpg"></a>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>All these pictures Duman glimpsed in his dreams and he gloried in each step that brought his destiny closer. But in the misty darkness of the edges of sleep, other pictures swept by in hazy obscurity. Unnoticed by the dreamer, content to watch only what he craves, and unlooked for by the mind, made lazy with overconfident complacency. </p>\r\n<p>Had Duman been less content, less lazy, then he... like you, reader... would have seen Jarok treading silently in the footsteps of Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, Duman might have seen him... and wondered who it might be... that dared to glare across the great divide with brazen fearlessness and fiery promise in his fiery eyes.</p>\r\n<p>But wait! </p>\r\n<p>A frown creases the wizard’s drowsy forehead. </p>\r\n<p>Hold your whispers, reader, lest you disturb him to alertness and he spy the soft shadow inching over the causeway. </p>\r\n<p>The wizard relaxes once more, soothed by the faint wheeze of his gentle snoring and distracted by the lure of renewed visions of victory.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 25, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

Lifting his Dragonmark to the sentry, Roaban called for him to open the gate. The area and buildings immediately inside the gate and wall were cleared of everything except the knights that lined the ramparts and heavily stocked armouries. After that, the city seemed to be divided into two sections. The northern sector had been given over to kitchens, a limited amount of livestock, food stores, areas for the wounded, stabling for the influx of horses belonging to the Elven Elite and living space for those who carried out the respective duties of cooking, nursing and tending the horses. Apart from a small contingent of men assigned to manning and watching the northern walls, all personnel were squashed into quarters in the southern sector, nearer the battlefront. Some of the buildings sat empty, ready for when those presently fighting outside the walls were forced to withdraw. Every other available space was packed, stacked and piled with anything that could be used as a weapon, ranging from lances and pitchforks to arrows and rocks. In the centre of the city, this organized chaos was kept at bay by the white-stoned inner walls of the Tower Palace that was ringed with guards (outside, inside and atop) from the Order of Romde Lor. In this inner sanctum the King, the Regents and the Elite Elders were grouped in continuous consultation.<p></p>\r\n<p>Roaban and Ammoel rode up to the palace gate only to have their way barred by crossed lances. After a gruelling test of their reasoning and sanity by the ultra-strict, blinkered discipline of the Kings'' personal guards they were still, to their anger and frustration, stuck firmly outside. </p>\r\n<p>"There are none so blind as those unable to think for themselves, to misuse a phrase," Ammoel was heard to remark later, but for now he pulled out his Rùyi Sh''œrè, expressed his outrage for their insulting behaviour and demanded entry as an Elite Elder. The red-faced Romde Lor stood aside with profuse apologies and let them in. </p>\r\n<p>"You kept that pretty quiet," said Roaban, as they tied up their horses. "I had no idea I was in such exalted company!"</p>\r\n<p>"You''re not," Ammoel winked. "I''m not an Elder... not in the Elfin sense of the word but compared to those men I am indeed... ''Elder''."</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know whether to call you clever or crafty,” laughed Roaban slapping the elf on the back. "But well thought. So how old are you anyway... if you don''t mind my asking?"</p>\r\n<p>"One thousand, three hundred and seventy two... and a bit," he finished with a grin.</p>\r\n<p>"One thousand, three hun... and a bit,” Roaban repeated, staring in stunned disbelief at Ammoel’s departing back. He shook his head and hurried up the palace steps after him. </p>\r\n<p>Yet another argument finally saw them entering the throne hall. The first person to catch their eyes was the hunched figure of the King, sitting crosswise on the raised throne, one foot up on the seat so that his knee was tucked beneath his chin. He stared vacantly at the floor as he picked absently at the frilled cuff of his shirt. Gathered around the back of the throne and sprawled about his feet were the white-faced and teary-eyed, fawning sycophants of his court, mumbling and muttering in terrified whispers. Roaban and Ammoel passed them over with disgust and moved down to the far end of the room, where the Regents and Elders were gathered around a large table strewn with parchments, books, bottles, goblets and plates of half-eaten, forgotten food. Roaban spotted Edum, his former Order Regent, and caught his attention as he stretched to ease the cramp in his back. Apologizing to the others at the table, Edum joined Roaban and Ammoel and led them to a smaller room down the corridor. "Well?" he asked as soon as the door closed behind them, his gruff voice made rougher by tiredness and worry. "Did you give the parchment to the Powerwielder?" "No, Sir," answered Roaban, wincing slightly ahead of the expected reaction.</p>\r\n<p>"NO?" bellowed Edum, as though they were on the opposite side of a training ground rather than the other side of a room. "I assume you''ve got an explanation for your blatant disregard of my orders? Do tell... I’m all ears."</p>\r\n<p>As Roaban explained all that had happened, Edum poured himself a goblet of wine and sat down to warm his feet by the fire. It was difficult to tell by his deliberately bland expression, the Regents’ thoughts on the report, which left Roaban fidgeting tensely in the long silence that followed. Placing his elbow on the arm of the chair, Edum rested his chin on his thumb and rubbed his forefinger across his lips, tongue clucking against the roof of his mouth as he stared with narrowed eyes at the man and elf standing before him. He straightened, emptied his goblet and placed it with deliberate exactness on the table and then, after a little lip-wriggling and thoughtful frowning began running through Roaban’s report. </p>\r\n<p>"Now, let''s see if I''ve got this right," he began, marking each point off on a finger until he came to the end when he clapped his hands together and leaned back in his chair, "the conclusion being that you handed a valuable and vital piece of information over to a complete stranger. Is that correct?"</p>\r\n<p>"Not exactly... Sir," Roaban added quickly. Edum was in no mood for easy familiarity today. "Both Ammoel and Gwym vouched for him. Gwym especially, since he was certain of his authenticity as the receiver in the Sharran’s vision. And it wasn''t me that handed it over... it was Velkaan... Sir."</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t bandy words with me young man or you''ll be back in the squire hall before you can notch an arrow and be damned as to whose Order you now belong to! Is that clear?" bawled Edum, thrusting himself to his feet and bending slightly to stare Roaban in the face.</p>\r\n<p>"No Sir... Yes Sir,” said Roaban, swiftly coming to attention and hoping fervently he had answered Edmun’s questions in the right order.</p>\r\n<p>"If I may speak?" Ammoel’s calm voice drifted quietly into the fraught tension. </p>\r\n<p>Edmun’s head swivelled in the elfs'' direction but Ammoel merely raised an eyebrow, not in the least intimidated by the Regents'' angry glower, and spoke anyway. </p>\r\n<p>"Sir Roaban was most concerned and unhappy about disobeying your instructions. I too, had reservations when I first met the stranger, however, I soon became convinced he was genuine. Also in Roaban’s defence, I would like to point out that there were four others present but that ultimately; since it was to him that the parchment had been entrusted; it was Velkaan’s decision as to whom it should be entrusted. In light of this overwhelming truth, I believe it to be unjust that Roaban take sole responsibility. Nor do I believe that he was... ''bandying words''... merely honestly relating the facts."</p>\r\n<p>There was a very, very long pause, during which Roaban wished the ground might open up and swallow him (a fate infinitely more desirable than Edmun’s displeasure) and then to his surprise Edmun’s lips curled into a rueful grin and a humorous sparkle lit his eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"And that''s a fine skill of word-play that you have yourself, young man. Did you have something more to say Roaban?" he flashed quickly, but with less vigour, at the knight. Roaban could do no more than shake his head. He was having too much difficulty hiding his mirth at Edmun’s reference to the one-and-a-half-thousand years old elf as a... ''young man''...&nbsp;to trust himself to speak.</p>\r\n<p>"Good," said Edum, but his eyes narrowed suspiciously on Roaban’s taut features before he continued. "Both of you go and get some food and rest and then report for duty. Ammoel? Your people are housed in Lors Square. Roaban will show you the way. You''re dismissed." He crossed over to the bottle of wine on the table to fill his goblet. </p>\r\n<p>They were halfway down the corridor when a runner went panting passed them, smack into the crossed axes of the guards on the door of the throne room. Roaban shook his head as he re-traced his steps. Something has really got to be done about the Romde Lor, he thought to himself angrily as he brushed passed them to get Edum.</p>\r\n<p>"Let him in, you fools,” roared Edum, striding down the corridor and yanking the axes out of their hands. The guards stared at him aghast and bewildered, spluttering inanely. Heaving a massive sigh of resignation, Edum gave them back their weapons and pushed them back into position either side of the door, after he had opened it to allow the runner through. Ignoring the disapproving glares of the guards, Roaban pointed to Edum and mouthed... ''we''re with him''... and then he and Ammoel hovered in the doorway and watched the runner drop onto one knee in front of the King upon his throne.</p>\r\n<p>"Sire! There is but one defence line left outside the city. The troops are doing their best to hold the enemy at bay but they''re taking heavy casualties. Captain Rysel requests permission to take some of the archers off the walls to cover the withdrawal of the wounded, rather than weaken the numbers fighting on the flanks. He says he''ll keep them well to the rear and return them all unharmed. But he needs the best, Sire and all the best are assigned to the walls." </p>\r\n<p>The King stared at him but said nothing.</p>\r\n<p>"May I return with your permission, Sire?" He paused and waited expectantly... and waited... and waited. He began to fiddle awkwardly with the hilt of his sword, then rose to his feet and took a step closer.</p>\r\n<p>"Sire? The situation is most urgent. May I give Captain Rysel your permission to take the archers?" he prompted. </p>\r\n<p>But the King only continued to sit and stare right through him, as though he was not even there. The runner glanced nervously towards the far table. Those gathered there had also risen, concerned glances flitting from the King and back to each other. With a muttered curse, Edum strode forward and placing an arm about the runners'' shoulders, steered him back into the corridor.</p>\r\n<p>"Tell Rysel to take whatever he needs... but I want them back," he said quietly.</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, Sir! Thank you, Sir," breathed the grateful runner.</p>\r\n<p>"And pass the order for all future reports to be made to the Regents Hall if I can''t be found personally."</p>\r\n<p>The runner nodded in relief and disappeared on swift feet to relay his messages. Edum watched him go then gazed sternly at Roaban and Ammoel, who had backed out of his way and were now hovering in the corridor instead, and pointed them on their way also. They left quickly. Not to find their quarters but to climb the ramparts, where they gazed solemnly over the wall and what met their eyes filled them with dread. </p>\r\n<p>The vast army of Duman spread like a dirty stain over the white landscape. Sula’s kinsmen they recognised immediately, though there was a bestial quality about them most definitely missing in the quiet goblin that had so quickly endeared herself to them. The main bulk of the enemy were creatures they had never seen before, resembling neither man (though they walked on two legs) nor beast (though they had reptilian heads with long snouts and scaly hides). Sprinkled amongst these two sets of creatures was a spattering of humans, though with their white, pasty faces and deep, black, hollowed eye sockets they seemed more like walking corpses than living men. </p>\r\n<p>“These men are the same type as those at Willoway,” he told Roaban, having recognised them immediately. “They are not as ordinary men. They are possessed by some sort of demon.”</p>\r\n<p>Down below in the courtyard, Rysel was rounding up his archers. Roaban and Ammoel nodded to each other and sped down the steps to the nearest armoury to grab bows and quivers. Outside they leapt onto spare horses and joined the archers galloping through the gates.</p>\r\n<p>"How good a shot are you?" Ammoel shouted above the drumming hooves.</p>\r\n<p>"Fair to excellent," replied Roaban, without conceit.</p>\r\n<p>"Then aim for the eyes or the groin. They seem to be the only vulnerable spots. And don''t bother with the humans; you''ll just waste your arrows. It''s near impossible to kill them unless you can get close enough to take off their heads."</p>\r\n<p>Up ahead, the battle waged with waves of horsemen riding in and away. The man next to Roaban explained that this had become the pattern after the first days'' standard. full-on engagement. As best as they could figure, they had lost four for every enemy they took and only one in ten of the wounded had managed to get back. They had also lost at least two leagues ground that afternoon. Roaban listened then passed on Ammoel’s advice and then there was no more time to talk as a hundred voices rose in Elfin battle cries and the Elven Elite swept swiftly by. Roaban frowned and squinted through the flying mud and slush chewed up by the horses. He was not the only one in the line of new archers looking confused. Suddenly he realised what was bothering him, he could not see any weapons. He turned quickly to Ammoel who was holding up a small, silver dart.</p>\r\n<p>"Spindle darts," he explained. "Quick and lethal to most subjects. An Elite whose expertise is in the ''flute''; I am not sure what the exact word would be in your language; can deliver up to ten in as many breaths. They are turned at the end to burrow deep into the victim," he added, as Roaban looked dubiously at the dart, no bigger than his thumb. But Roaban quickly revised his opinion as a third of the enemy front rank went down. </p>\r\n<p>On the heels of the Elite came a wave of knights with swords and long-handled battle-axes swinging neck height to the gracht as they charged the enemy line. Metal clashed and clanged. Bodies thudded together in heavy grunts. Blood spewed in all directions. Horses trained to use their hooves in battle, reared and slashed at gracht snouts and bellies, stomping on the fallen few. In the exhilaration of their success, the knights lingered too long and suddenly the grachtan front line parted and a row of goblins stepped forward. Screaming neighs rent the air as the goblins'' long arms reached past and below the knights weapons and took down the horses. Those knights that had had the good fortune to fall nearside of their stricken mounts managed to get to their feet to defend themselves. Those that went down at the feet of the enemy had not even the time to think of it. </p>\r\n<p>The archers moved slowly forward, sending wave after wave of arrows over the heads of their comrades into the enemy lines until the Knights Lancers arrived on the scene. Riding stirrup to stirrup, two lances apiece lowered in the cups on their legs, their heavily armoured horses thundered into the enemy. The speed of their mounts added extra thrust to their lances, allowing them to pierce through the thick scales of the gracht behind the downed goblins and push them back, long enough for those that could run to reach the spare horses brought by the racing squires following closely on the heels of the Lancers. As soon as they were clear the knights dropped their lances, wheeled their mounts and followed them back to safety. Moments later the advancing army stepped over the dead bodies at their feet and the pattern was repeated, again and again, until fresh reinforcements arrived and the tired and battered defenders limped exhausted to the safety of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Come darkness the First Order and the Elite... ''Shadow Walkers''... came into their own. Slipping stealthily into the gracht encampments along the enemy flanks, they slew as many of the sleeping as they could, stole weapons and poisoned water. Such actions came hard to the Elite but they did what was necessary, each deferring their own private war of conscience until less perilous times. The next day and night followed similar patterns, only the sequence and mode of weapons altered in an effort to retain at least a modicum of surprise. The day after also passed the same but on the third evening, everything changed. </p>\r\n<p>Word of their nightly raids finally filtered through the ranks of the slow-witted gracht to the ears of Ishkat and she laid a trap, placing groups of her sharp-eyed kinsmen amongst the sprawling bodies of dozing gracht. This time, as the First and Walkers crept through the night, the goblins watched them coming and after allowing them a fair distance of unhindered penetration, they pounced. The First lost two thirds of their number that night and the Walkers, just over half. And of those that were able to make their way back to the city, only a scant few did not carry at least one injury. Dazed and demoralized they hobbled passed the rows of horsed sentries guarding the outskirts, to fall into the arms of the squires that rushed from the gates to help them. A profound silence fell upon the city as the men and elves inside watched the wagons of wounded being driven to the northern sector. Nagging doubts and dreads began to rise with a fatalistic sense of futility. </p>\r\n<p>These were the respective... ''best of their best''... and if these could be so effectively routed then what chance had they, the average, run-of-the-mill soldiers?</p>\r\n<p>Pessimism and fear began to spread as rumoured details of the nights'' defeat were muttered and murmured from bunk to bunk in the cramped barracks. The resulting drop in morale soon materialised in silly mistakes and decreased efforts on the battlefield. As a consequence, there were more defeats with greater mortalities, which in turn saw the enemy striding ominously closer to the walls of Symtar and yet further loss of morale. And so, in the manner of the turning wheel of action and reaction, with each successive defeat the problem intensified &mdash; the defenders'' inner turmoil hampering their abilities in a spiralling escalation of disasters. The Regents, Elders and their immediate officers did their best to instil renewed hope and improve morale but with the ever depressing sight of the barely dented horde looming ever nearer, they were faced with as near an impossible task as the reality of victory.</p>\r\n<p>Finally admitting the costly futility of trying to ward off the inevitable, the Regents ordered the building of one last defence. Roaban was woken by such a banging and crashing that for a moment, he thought the enemy had already entered the city. Grabbing his weapons he rushed out into the streets. Men and elves were running everywhere. Carrying tables, chairs, benches, doors and even window frames. Anything that would burn, in fact, was all being loaded onto wagons and trundled outside. Whole buildings were stripped and gutted to provide fuel for a massive firewall that was being constructed about half a leagues distance from the city and circling three-quarters of the city wall. Back and forth the wagons rumbled until they too, were up-ended and took their place in the barrier and then squires walked back and forth soaking the barricade with oil. As twilight crept dimly into the early, winter afternoon a trumpet sounded from the ramparts. Those behind the barricade returned to the city. Those beyond broke off their attacks and headed a safe distance west to tend their wounded and prepare themselves for counter attacks. Finding themselves suddenly unopposed the enemy charged and the squires standing nervously by placed their firebrands into the barricade. With a mighty ''whoosh'' the flames flared upwards, heat and smoke billowing in all directions and scorching all who dared to venture too close. Realising it was impossible to cross through such an inferno, Ishkat threw back her head and howled her frustrations to the wind. The ground began to tremble beneath the stomping feet of her kinsmen as they took up her call with the deep rumbling of their low-throated snarls. Riding on the fiery crackling of the spouting flames, the bestial echo chilled the hearts and shrivelled the waning courage of the tense and increasingly, uneasy defenders of Symtar. </p>\r\n<p>From his position on the rampart, Roaban watched the flames rise and spit and play amidst the dancing smoke. It would not take long, he realised, for such ferocity to consume the fuel provided. His best guess gave them to mid-morning the following day at the latest and after that the fire would have died down enough for the enemy to force a way through. He frowned as the goblins cries drifted eerily on the icy wind and placed a reassuring arm on the shoulder of the man beside him to help still the shuddering that had caused his bow to slip through nerveless fingers. The man turned a white face towards him as he bent to retrieve his weapon. Roaban kicked the stone and returned to his own musings. The wall was solid and thick. Built to withstand anything that man could throw at it. But it was no man that hunched with predatory intent beyond the flames. No normal enemy was this.&nbsp;And what of the gates? Solid oak they may be and thick and sturdy but in the end they were only wood. </p>\r\n<p>''Wood,'' he thought, staring at the brilliant, red and orange barrier of fire stretching about the city, ''that can easily be burned, or chopped, or battered into splintered shreds. Certainly there were enough creatures out there to do it.'' </p>\r\n<p>Unconsciously at first, his eyes measured the distance between fire and wall. There had to be some way... some thing... they could make or do, to prevent the enemy from simply walking straight up to them &mdash; but what? He slid down the stone. Squatting out of the wind and unsettling noise, to think. It was a pity that the city had not been built with some kind of natural defence that they could utilize without straining their limited resources.&nbsp;Natural defence... the words echoed softly in his mind. His wrist began to itch. He scratched at it absently, fingers probing under his cuff as it moved along his arm. It refused to go away and he pushed up his sleeve for a more satisfying scratch. The Dragonmark on his arm was positively glowing! </p>\r\n<p>He laughed aloud and jumped to his feet. Those nearby stared at him as though he was quite mad, as he leaned precariously over the wall then ran passed them down the steps, slapping each on the arm and shouting that he... ''had it!''</p>\r\n<p>"Well I hope it''s not catching,” shouted someone as he took the last four steps in one bound, the subsequent laughter injecting momentary relief into the strained tension.</p>\r\n<p>The Regents and Elders were hesitant when he first explained his proposal. The Dragonmarks were their biggest weapon and they had wanted to keep them as a last resort. Roaban disagreed, arguing that it was unreasonable not to use them to their best advantage... and keeping the horde out was surely to their best advantage. The surrounding area was mostly flat countryside with only bushes and shrubs marking roads, tracks and fields. The closest places that would provide useful-sized trees were around Perrahove (which the goblins had already razed to the ground). Tainwood, about thirty leagues to the west &mdash; and the Longpine Stands, just inside the Fellisan border. There were a few odd trees dotted here and there but all these would take some time finding, felling and dragging all the way back. Time they desperately needed. He waited impatiently while they talked amongst themselves, straining to hear the contents of their quiet murmurings.</p>\r\n<p>"How many would you need to use?" asked one of the Elders. </p>\r\n<p>"Honestly? I''m not sure," admitted Roaban. "It may be that mine alone would be powerful enough but I don''t want to give the enemy any chance of discovering what we''re up to by finding out it''s not and having to repeat ourselves. I''d rather be safe than sorry. How many are here, do you know exactly?" he asked Edum.</p>\r\n<p>"Ten."</p>\r\n<p>"Well then, let''s say one for each point of the compass. That will still leave you six to cover the retreat. I presume that''s why you''re saving them... for when the goblins breach the walls?"</p>\r\n<p>None of those seated in the room confirmed or denied his suspicions verbally but their faces spoke volumes and told him all needed to know. Edum got up slowly, his face solemn as he gave Roaban stern warning that nothing was to leave the room. They had enough rumours destroying morale already. The men did not need to know, Edum informed him, that the surrender of the city had already been planned and that the King and his court, along with a company of Romde Lor, had already been sent to the hills. It had been quite obvious since the first disastrous encounter, that they would be unable to successfully defend the city. When the time came, as it must, they would move to the hills and continue their resistance from there. That was why they needed the Dragonmarks, to keep the enemy occupied while they made their escape. Even though Roaban had already come to this conclusion himself, hearing Edum speak the words aloud still came a shock. </p>\r\n<p>He gazed about the room. These were not stupid men. Nor were they cowards. They would not give over Symtar unless they had no choice. Roaban understood their reasoning. Symtar was not Rohansuk &mdash; and better to relinquish a few piles of old stone and live to save the land, than struggle with obstinate fatality to the bitter end for one city.</p>\r\n<p>Cities could be rebuilt. The only thing that bothered him was the unnecessary loss of men for something they did not intend to hold.</p>\r\n<p>"May I make another suggestion?" he asked Edum, who glanced quickly around the group and then nodded. "If you''re resigned to losing the city at some point anyway, why not leave now? Why throw away more lives than you have to? Station a few companies here, to keep the enemy busy while you get organised in the mountains, but take the rest," he finished eagerly and was hard put to hide his disappointment when Edum said they would... ''think it over''... and dismissed him. </p>\r\n<p>Roaban had just fallen into a restless sleep when he was shaken awake by Edum and told that his plan had been approved. Elated, he jumped from his bed and pulled on his boots, asking how long it would take to empty the city.</p>\r\n<p>"Too long," he shook his head when Edum told him. "The fire will be out by then. We have to buy some time."</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll get the squires re-fuelling. There''s plenty more we can burn now we''re going."</p>\r\n<p>"And we''ll need some dummies for the ramparts."</p>\r\n<p>"Already being done," said Edum. "You find the others and get yourselves into position."</p>\r\n<p>"We can help for a while yet, sir," insisted Roaban.</p>\r\n<p>"I want you ready so that you''ll have plenty of time to get back inside. Rysel will be staying behind to take charge," Edum told him as they walked out into the hall. "And I''ll be leaving Wylen too, just in case, so make sure he''s not one of those you chose. Right. Off you go. And good luck."</p>\r\n<p>"You too, sir." </p>\r\n<p>Roaban wished that Edum had let him help. The waiting seemed endless as he sat kicking his heels, watching the squires hurrying back and forth to the fire, that was dwindling at an alarming rate, and the swelling ranks of the enemy pressing closer and closer. He hoped Edum would not take much longer. Out of his sight, his three, fellow Dragonmark bearers were also pacing restlessly and casting anxious glances back to the city as they waited for the single trumpet call to sound. </p>\r\n<p>Suddenly there was an almighty roar and the front ranks of gracht were thrown forward onto the shrinking flames in an outburst of surprised grunts and choking cries. The barricade came crashing down and the flames spluttered up in a shower of sparks and died, as over the top of the fallen bodies came the howling mass of the goblin army. Arrows whistled across the sky, over the heads of the startled knights. Roaban turned and lifted his arm to signal the lookout to pull his fellow knights back, there was no time now to use the Mark, but a hand on his wrist stopped him. It was Ammoel, pulling him down to a crouch.</p>\r\n<p>"Keep still and don''t touch them. They mean you no harm. As soon as they have passed, use the Mark! The others are also being told," he added quickly, correctly interpreting Roaban’s anxious frown.&nbsp;Roaban did not have to turn his head to see the great swathe of rats coming to their aid &mdash; they were already upon him. Pouring over and around him in their thousands. Focused and silent, save for the tumultuous whisper of their racing feet, they swept across the dividing space and over the oncoming goblins who faltered and disappeared beneath a writhing wall of black and brown fur. When they had all passed, some of their number turned and began pacing backwards, sharp eyes staring intently at Roaban. Quickly he counted the distance he wanted fixed his gaze there. The rats hurried to that spot and sat.</p>\r\n<p>"Now," he told Ammoel, who waved to the lookout to blow the trumpet while Roaban pressed his arm to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>"All around these city walls, we bid thee answer to our calls. </p>\r\n<p>Quickening Power send aloft and grace us with thy presence soft!"</p>\r\n<p>A warm tingling spread up Roaban’s arm. He felt the tail of the tiny Dragon uncurled itself from his wrist and faint pricks against his skin, as though the Dragon’s talons pressed into his flesh as it hunched and threw itself aloft. Yet he did not see it move. He only saw the vibrant colours glow translucently before gradually fading into nothing. Beneath his knees, the ground shivered, rippled for about twenty paces, gave a soft heave and fell still. Roaban frowned and scratched his head. He had not been sure quite what to expect but he had expected something a little more dramatic that this. </p>\r\n<p>Had it worked? </p>\r\n<p>Ammoel was wondering the same thing but there was no time to test it. Pulling Roaban to his feet he dragged him away, back to the gates. The rats were already scurrying away, left and right, leaving the way clear for the re-advancing enemy. Racing through the gates, Roaban and Ammoel rushed straight to the ramparts. Below them, a band of smooth earth cut a swathe through the otherwise, hoof-churned ground. Roaban crossed his fingers that it identified the moat of quicksand he hoped the Dragonmarks had created as the first of the enemy raced onto it &mdash; their first two or three strides carried them over its surface but then, to the rousing cheers of the men on the wall, they began to sink. The more they struggled, the deeper they went. Those behind skidded to a halt on the edge of the quicksand but were sent sprawling headfirst into it by the momentum of those behind, until the shouts and screams finally penetrated the rear ranks and they stopped their advance. </p>\r\n<p>"I guess I won''t be needing these anymore," Roaban grinned at Ammoel and un-crossed his fingers.</p>\r\n<p>For once, Ishkat was not at the head of the mass of bodies surging forward and did not see what had happened. But she heard the shouts of surprise and confusion, the grachtan cries for help and the call to stop. Livid at their stupidity and cowardice, she thrust her way to the front... leaving a number of casualties behind her... just in time to the see the last few heads sink beneath the surface. She frowned. The Great Father had not told her about this swallowing earth. Holding on to the gracht next to her, she put her foot on the ground ahead and felt the softness sucking at her toes. As she tried to pull her foot free the sucking grew stronger. She was puzzled. Two feet back on firm ground she pushed the gracht, that had been supporting her and who had helped her pull her foot free, into the mire and watched with fascination as his desperate struggles only took him deeper. It was like the bogs, she thought, but thicker and stronger and more deceiving... for unlike the popping brown mud, this pretended to be as normal ground. She cast her eyes forward and left to right. Noticed the band of smoothness that only the hoof-churned sludge either side revealed and saw that it encompassed the city as far as her eye could see. </p>\r\n<p>She ordered a group of those closest to her to jump. When they hesitated she smiled, raised her axe and offered them a choice: certain death or possible promotion. All of them fell short. Ishkat screamed her curses at the jeering faces and mocking taunts coming down from the ramparts. Grabbing a spear, she hurled it with all her fury. Luckily, it was only one of the dummies that it impaled and sent thumping into the courtyard beyond. The mocking taunts continued but the majority of the jeering faces now disappeared behind the safety of the stone.</p>\r\n<p>Roaban’s elation as he watched the goblin turn and walk back into the midst of her army was soon deflated however. It did not take Ishkat as long as he had calculated to bridge the quicksand, for he had reckoned without the goblins'' lack of sensibility and human decency. She made no attempt to go in search of wood but stripped the flesh from the bodies of the dead (she saw no point in wasting good meat) and lashed the bones together to make the bridges she needed. Fortunately, the resulting structures were narrow and brittle and could not stand the weight of large numbers. And the gap between quicksand and wall was also narrow, so that Ishkat was restricted as the to numbers she could send at any one time. Still it seemed that they might well be overwhelmed before their resistance had even begun. </p>\r\n<p>So the battle for Symtar resumed in earnest far sooner than anticipated. Even with the return of the Knights and the Elite who, rested and re-formed, swept down from the hills and engaged the enemy on its flanks, Roaban and his companions were forced to fight almost continuously. Snatching only short naps and the odd mouthful of cold food between skirmishes, they struggled valiantly in an exhausting and mind-numbing fight for survival. Muscles and bones became one continuous ache. Stomachs were so empty they had not even the energy to growl about the gnawing hunger that became only a faint echo, somewhere in the back of minds that could think only of moving leaden arms and legs and checking the stacks of weapons by their sides. Hardly a word passed amongst them, other than to shout warning or call alarm. They lost all track of time. Ceased to notice the passage of day into night except as a reminder to refuel the torches that flickered in the silent streets, casting eerie shadows that moved and swayed like ghostly shades of a vanished people. Whilst behind the torches, the unlit windows and open doors of the empty buildings mocked their determination to save a deserted city already dead from abandonment. But despite their growing despondency, engendered by this hollow emptiness of body and surroundings, they held on, spurred by the knowledge that they were buying time for the Powerwielder to do her work.</p>\r\n<p>It was just after dawn: cold and icy. The men on the walls blew their white breath into their hands and chafed them together to warm numb fingers. Someone called an alarm. Every head rose to stare at the dark shape forming up from the southeast. With their hearts in their stomachs they watched it grow. It was a large force but that was all they could tell. It was too far away even for Ammoel’s sharp Elfin eyes to identify. Captain Rysel called out instructions to prepare for withdrawal, should it prove to be enemy reinforcements.</p>\r\n<p>Outside the walls, Ishkat was quick to notice the way the staring gazes of the men. She climbed onto the shoulders of one of the gracht to see what was happening. Her deafening roar gave hope to the hearts of men and when she sent a large force out to engage the incoming riders, the knights knew it must be the Fellis and an almighty cheer resounded from within the besieged city. For a few, elated moments they might have been revellers at a feast, rather than dirty, hungry and exhausted defenders of a lost cause &mdash; but for moments only. For Ishkat, confident and single-minded in her hunger for victory, dismissed the incoming reinforcements from her mind and threw herself back into the central battle. </p>\r\n<p>The Great Father demanded the city... and the city he would have!</p>\r\n<p>Things were not to be that simple for her however. For the welcoming sight of the galloping Fellis was not the only event to infect their flagging spirits like intoxicating wine. They received word of the amazing and wondrous appearance of two of the Ancient Heroes, Gregos and Torje, within their forces outside. Roaban and his fellow defenders were inspired to new heights, finding depths of strength and courage that they did not even know they possessed and startling Ishkat with the unprecedented fierceness in their renewed defence. </p>\r\n<p>And so the battle rose with feverish intensity as Ishkat, in her turn, responded with an increased determination of her own.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 25, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(48, 'River rats to the rescue', 'CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="T" src="T.gif">hough many leagues apart, a similar tale was unfolding at Talgheer, as the Soyex Raiders also discovered the costly foolhardiness of confronting the goblin-grachtan army head on. From thereon, like those at Symtar, they concentrated their efforts in short sharp bursts to the flanks, using every skill, tactic and trick to keep the enemy at bay behind the defensive ditches. Even so, just as at Symtar, the enemy slowly but surely beat them back and swarmed the ditches one by one. Some took them a little longer than others but they took them nonetheless and with their steady stream of casualties, the Soyex were forced to send back reports of one defeat after another. They were a proud and arrogant people, unused to being on the receiving end of a superior force and it irked them to the core, to find themselves continually on the run. But they were also determined and resourceful. Quick to gauge an enemy’s'' strength and uncover their weaknesses and to devise a means to exploit the latter in order to overcome the former. They had conquered the awesome seas... they would not be outdone by grotesque deformities of magic. And so it was, that the clever hands of the dwarves received the idea for a new weapon which they named, the crossbow. The horizontal bow fixed across a wooden stock would take a shorter arrow, which slotted into a groove. The vastly increased tautness of the string, made possible by drawing it back to lock into place at a trigger point rather than being held only with fingers, would result in greater speed and thus deeper penetration. If they fashioned the arrow from metal, it should be forceful enough to penetrate the thick, scaly hide of the enemy, so said the instructions. <p></p>\r\n<p>The jumble of squiggles and lines, which the dwarves scrawled by way of explaining the workings, meant little to Davin when Rhodka offered them for his approval but bearing in mind the many useful and innovative contraptions he had seen on Katatuk, he told them to go ahead anyway. Infected by their enthusiasm, Davin accompanied the Katas as they hurried into the streets calling for carpenters and blacksmiths. Before long every forge in the town was ringing with the sound of hammers on anvils, the huff-puff of bellows, the rush of fire and hissing of metal. And behind this buzzing hive of smithery, came the rasping of saws and the hammering of nails and the milling hum of many voices, rising and falling with the rumbustious life that was the Dwarvish tongue. </p>\r\n<p>Bemused and bewildered by the frenetic activity and the unintelligible words bouncing over his head, Davin was nevertheless fascinated and, caught up in the possibility of an effective weapon, found himself following in Rhodka’s wake like a besotted puppy as the First Kata bustled about, encouraging the various groups of industrious workers whilst checking on each ones'' progress. Much sooner than Davin ever dared imagination the first working model was placed firmly in his hands. He turned it over with wonder. The dwarves'' speed had not been at the compromise of their workmanship and Davin marvelled at their skill before handing it back to one of the waiting dwarves to demonstrate. His was not the only face to split into a wide grin as the bolt (as the dwarves decided to call the shortened arrow) pierced the thick, beam target and reappeared on the other side. There was mighty cheer and much backslapping and then Rhodka called his people back to work. By noon the next day, the first batch of crossbows was on its way to the Soyex.</p>\r\n<p>Typical of the dwarvish desire to improve and perfect, they continued work on the crossbow and, to Davin’s surprised delight, soon developed an even more effective model capable of firing six shots in rapid succession or, if preferred, all at once. This second batch was sent up to the gipsies that were manning the Ridge pass, through which the Westbrooke River ran down to the Bay of Respite. They had sent word to Davin that a force of about four hundred gracht were approaching on foot, marching three abreast either side of the river. Along with the crossbows, Davin sent orders to allow the enemy to advance to the narrowest part of the pass where the current raced in swift, white foamed water. In such close quarters and hampered by the narrow banks and steep sides, their enormous size would no longer be an advantage but a liability. </p>\r\n<p>So the gipsies let them come, anchoring their floating bridge of lashed-together barges a short distance ahead of the final bend just east of Talgheer, where the Ridge sloped inwards and forced the river into a series of ''S'' bend rapids. The gracht halted momentarily as they came into sight of the barges and the pitiful band of men standing upon them and began to laugh, having as yet to be pressed by anything man had offered. With taunting cries, they charged the gipsies, who let come until they could almost smell their fetid breath and before opening fire. </p>\r\n<p>The short bolts of the crossbows whizzed almost soundlessly across the distance and thudded into surprised flesh. While the front row reloaded, those behind took their shots, whilst from up above, a storm of rocks and spears thundered down upon those at the rear. Dead and wounded fell into the foaming water and were swept away downstream. Forced onwards by those behind wanting their part of the kill, the gracht continued to attack and were continuously cut down. The river ran red. Pink froth spraying up and around the body-choked rocks and boulders of the rapids. At last, with half their force and all their officers gone, the remaining gracht turned and ran, straight into the small contingent of Raiders, the Captains had sent up the Westbrooke behind them. The gipsies on the Ridge signalled the Soyex arrival and the men on the barges moved downriver to meet them. Cornered on all sides, the fate of the gracht was quickly and satisfactorily sealed and the pass rang wild with the jubilant cheers of celebration. </p>\r\n<p>By contrast, Ishtak’s raw bellow of rage sounded across the open space and bounced up off the shining black Zafchak in acute pangs of intense frustration. A shudder ran through Davin’s body at the primeval sound, bursting with open, violent hate. Hurrying to the top of the wall, he looked over at the enemy encampment, stretching like an enormous black scab on the whitened earth. A wide gap had opened around one of the creatures whose head was tilted up to the sky and who, Davin surmised, was the source of the chilling noise.</p>\r\n<p>"Doesn''t sound too happy, does it?" he quipped with false lightness to Mawbek, who had followed him.</p>\r\n<p>"Good," answered Mawbek, absently rubbing his aching hip. His old eyes strained into the distance. "What''s it doing now?"</p>\r\n<p>"Taking its anger out on its underlings by the looks of it," grinned Burtak, as Ishtak lashed out ferociously on all sides and with incredible speed, dropped half a dozen or more to their knees before the rest had the time or wit to move away.</p>\r\n<p>"Pity we didn''t have time to dig a few more of those ditches," murmured Mawbek.</p>\r\n<p>"Begging your pardon, Sir," said a young man standing next to him. "But I don''t think it''s anything to do with the ditches. I think it''s those." </p>\r\n<p>He turned and pointed up to the Ridge where a row of beacons blazed brightly.</p>\r\n<p>"I think he''s right. That thing looks as though it''s pointing that way too. Oops! There goes another," Burtak turned to Davin, but he was already sprinting down the steps to Rhodka who was shouting up the news of the gipsy victory. Soon the whole town was alive with cheers and laughter and victory songs.</p>\r\n<p>"So, your crossbows were a complete success," said Saroya, as she placed a plate of hot bread and melted cheese in the middle of the table and sat down.</p>\r\n<p>"Overall, yes. The bolts still seem to slide off the creatures'' hides if the angle of entry isn''t right but they''re certainly more effective than the normal bow and arrow," Rhodka smiled smugly. </p>\r\n<p>"Here''s to these... ''catapult''... things you''ve built faring as well," said Davin, raising his mug in a toast. Rhodka tapped it with his own mug, slopping ale across the table.</p>\r\n<p>"Of course they will," he replied confidently and downed his mug in one.</p>\r\n<p>"I''d feel better if I could see it in action first," Davin murmured, still unsure about the dwarves newest contraption.</p>\r\n<p>"We''ve been through this a dozen times. It''s better the enemy doesn''t know what we''ve got until they have too."</p>\r\n<p>"I guess you''re right," Davin flicked the stray lock of hair out of his eyes and leant forward, resting his chin on his knuckles with a heavy sigh.</p>\r\n<p>"But," prompted Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>Saroya’s chair scraped across the floor as she rose.</p>\r\n<p>"If you two are going to talk shop, I''m going back to check on the wounded."</p>\r\n<p>Davin placed his hand over hers on the edge of the table.</p>\r\n<p>"I want you and the other women to stay on the far side of the bridge. No more wandering back and forth," he said firmly.</p>\r\n<p>"Someone has to help the wounded to safety," she replied. "And make sure you all eat."</p>\r\n<p>"We''re old enough to cut ourselves a slice of bread. And there are plenty of able men here to bring the wounded to you. Stay on your own side of the bridge or I''ll post a guard to make you."</p>\r\n<p>"Is that an order? Sir?" she asked with unveiled sarcasm.</p>\r\n<p>He got his feet and turned her gently to face him, placing his palms softly against her cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry. I didn''t mean to be so sharp. No, it''s not an order. It''s a request. Please Saroya. I... " He stopped. How could he explain this gut feeling that had been churning ever since he had heard that awful cry filled with threat and promise. Something was going to happen. Soon. He did not know what but this feeling had never let him down before and until it was over, he wanted Saroya safely out harms way. As safe as she could be within the confines of the town at any rate, Saroya glared at him but could not sustain it before the worried creases around his tired eyes, full of unconscious pleading. Her face softened. </p>\r\n<p>"We''ll stay there... on one condition," she replied. "You give me a dozen men. We''ll prepare the food and they can carry it over here. I haven''t known dwarves very long but it seems to me they''re next to useless on an empty stomach," she winked at Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s got a point there," answered Rhodka rubbing his growling belly. </p>\r\n<p>"I''ll send them over in the morning," agreed Davin with a relieved smile.</p>\r\n<p>"Then I''ll be off. Goodnight to you both." </p>\r\n<p>She kissed Davin lightly on the cheek and bent over to kiss Rhodka also, who whispered in her ear that he would make sure Davin did not forget to eat each day, knowing that this was her main reason for coming. She mouthed a silent ''thank you'' as she straightened up.</p>\r\n<p>"Saroya," Davin called out as she reached the door and picking up his bow and quiver pressed them into her hands. "Take these."</p>\r\n<p>She looked at the eagle’s feather laying softly against the back of his hand, the rich brown only a shade darker than the deep tan of his skin, and stroked both together. She wiped the frown from her brow before looking up into his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"If you insist," she shrugged with feigned carelessness. "But what you think I''ll need them for, I''m sure I don''t know."</p>\r\n<p>"What''s really the matter?" asked Rhodka, once Davin had closed the door behind her. Davin explained, as best he could, the feeling of misgiving that had been gnawing at him all day. Rhodka could not say he understood it but he respected the knight’s experience, which far exceeded his own and that of any of his kinsmen. They had skill and knowledge, handed down through the generations. They practised in mock wars on training islands to maintain their physical and mental efficiency, but none of that was real. One did not develop the gut instinct for survival (which Davin was describing) when there was no real danger. So, if Davin sensed that there was another danger in the offing, aside from the vast horde directly at their door, then he trusted that feeling and was willing to act on it in any way the knight deemed fit. He was about to say this, when they were interrupted by a sharp knock on the door and the entry of a breathless squire.</p>\r\n<p>"Excuse me Sir," he nodded to Davin, "but you said you wanted to be informed. The Soyex are pulling back now."</p>\r\n<p>"Time to try out those catapults," Davin grinned at Rhodka, emptied his mug and reached automatically for his bow before remembering he had given it to Saroya. Feeling somehow naked without it, he nevertheless made do with one of the swords stacked in the corner and strapping it on quickly, followed Rhodka and the squire up onto the wall.</p>\r\n<p>The last line of Soyex were jumping the final ditch and galloping towards the river. Behind them, the gracht surged, with bloodcurdling cries, to what they believed was the final obstacle to victory; the wall of black Zafchak upon which the dwarves stood patiently beside their loaded catapults. Davin shouted for the archers to hold their fire. When the pounding feet of the leading rows of gracht had mashed the thick covering of straw and grass into the Zafchak beneath, so that others started to become mired in the syrupy blackness, Davin gave the order for them to light the ditch. </p>\r\n<p>The roaring ''whoosh'' of flame was drowned beneath the terrible screams of those caught within it. Open mouths belched fiery breath, as flaming arms and tails flailed uselessly and fell slowly beneath the consuming life of the fire. Arrows and bolts rained down on those trapped between fire and wall, whilst those cut off behind were bombarded by rocks, sharpened metal and balls of burning Zafchak from the catapults. Madness and confusion ripped away what little coherent thought gracht possessed. Shouting and screaming, they ran mindlessly in all directions, striking out at anything that stood in their way. Fires sprang up in their midst. Spreading as the dying stumbled aflame through the ranks of the living, grasping for help with arms of death.</p>\r\n<p>Ishtak’s cold, calculating mind was the first to recover. Dropping to the ground and covering himself with his shield, he shouted his orders to those around him. The gracht turned their backs to the incoming rush of arrows, with the goblins amongst them huddling behind the safety of their armoured bodies. Once his own command was under control, Ishtak bellowed dire threats to the remainder that this was nothing to what he would do to them, if they did not pull back out of range and wait calmly until he could rejoin them. The goblins in their ranks soon got the gracht under control and herded them away.</p>\r\n<p>All day the Zafchak burned. Long after the men on the wall had ceased firing. Yet its heat paled, as the moon before the sun, in the face of Ishtak’s furnace of raging anger. His wrathful curses singed the ears of those about him and bore down all manner of excruciating and dreadful recompense upon the heads of the vile forces of evil that dared to oppose the wishes of the Great and Loving Father of all good and obedient children. The self-aimed curses for his careless stupidity, he kept selectively silent and uttered only to the privacy of his own mind, which he gradually managed to pull into rational thought as to what he was going to do now.</p>\r\n<p>Davin had called for the archers to stop firing as soon as he realised they were only wasting their arrows. After a time, Mawbek brought him the toll of casualties. There were more wounded than dead, thank the Mother, but although it was not as bad as he had feared, it was still far more than he would have liked. He could not help but admire the accuracy of the enemy throws. From such a distance and under such conditions, it was nothing short of incredible. He looked down at the two split groups. They should have been vulnerable and easy targets. But even as small as it was compared to the main horde, with nearly half his men already nursing at least one wound, he knew he dared not even send a force against those trapped before the flames. He was going to need every one if this battle was not be over before it had truly started. He had no illusions that they had yet to enter the thick of it. Every so often he found his eyes straying to the rocky slopes of the Ridge on his left. He knew there were Gypsies hidden amongst them, armed with Rhodka’s crossbows and patrolling the slopes they knew like the backs of their hands. Still that uncomfortable nagging tugged at his middle as he watched the Ridge fade into the night sky.</p>\r\n<p>Davin’s anxiety was not falsely held, for Ishtak too had been gazing steadfastly at the Ridge from beneath the edges of his shield and as soon as the darkness of the moonless night took command, he slipped away along the edges of the ditch until he reached a place where the fire burned low enough for him to lay his shield upon it and cross over. Despite his huge feet, he ran soundlessly to where the rest of his army waited and, calling his kinsmen together, gathered a large force of his best and sent them into the mountains. He reminded them of the way the men had cheered and celebrated their victory over the gracht. No doubt they were still gloating and awash with swaggering confidence. They would be slack and weak in their ease, not expecting a second attack in the same place. But even if they were prepared, this time they would face goblins, not the puny-minded gracht that ran at even the slightest provocation! </p>\r\n<p>They were to travel only by night. There were bound to be guards amongst the rocks but they would be at a disadvantage in the darkness and easy pickings. These were to be dealt with swiftly and silently. No time was to be wasted on feasting; there would be plenty of that later. They would hide during the day and then enter the city along the riverbank and attack when the first stars opened their eyes. By this time the fire would be done and he would be free to destroy the wall. Ishtak did not wait to watch them go but turned immediately to those goblins left behind and gave them their orders, before slipping back to his original position on the far side of the fire to sleep out the rest of the night and day.</p>\r\n<p>Davin on the other hand was as far from sleep as the moon from the earth. He paced restlessly about the hushed streets until he came to the bridge, changed his mind and decided not to visit Saroya in his present, agitated state, and wandered back to the wall.</p>\r\n<p>He leaned over and peered out into the darkness. The enemy had not moved. Silhouetted against the orange glow of the fire, they were spread in a long hump, like a hideous, black snake stretching its coils to soak up the warmth of the flames. He turned at the sound of soft, shuffling footsteps. The watch was changing. He left the wall, picked up some bread from a table in the common room and went to his bed. </p>\r\n<p>Lying on his back with his feet resting up against the wall, he bit off a chunk of the bread. It tasted like sawdust in his mouth but he swallowed it anyway to quieten the growling moan beneath his belt. His mind wandered to Tynan and he wondered what had happened to stop his friend from returning. He knew that many of the Dragonmarks had been used but he did not know who or to what cost.&nbsp;Had Tynan been one of them?&nbsp;Was he hurt or...? </p>\r\n<p>He refused to think of the other. Tynan was clever and resourceful and nobody’s fool. He was a thinker. He always considered all the options. He was not disposed to rashness or impetuosity. He would not do anything stupid. </p>\r\n<p>Then why was he not here? </p>\r\n<p>He swung his legs over the side of the bed and dropped his head in his lap, pushing his fingers through his tangled hair until his palms came to rest on the back of his neck. Tired and weary, he finally dozed off to the music of his worries being crushed between his grinding teeth.</p>\r\n<p>He woke with a start. Daylight streamed in through the open window. The air was crisp and fresh and strangely quiet. He groaned as he pulled himself up from his uncomfortable position and hurried outside. He gazed up at the sun. It was almost midday. Furious, he strode to the main hall of the barracks, his face dark as thunder as he scowled with steely eyes upon the gathered Kata.</p>\r\n<p>"Davin! Have some ale," offered Rhodka cheerily, before Davin could give vent to the hot words that warmed his tongue.</p>\r\n<p>"Water will do fine," he replied shortly. "Why wasn''t I wakened earlier?"</p>\r\n<p>"What for?" asked Rhodka. "There''s absolutely nothing happening. Those things are still just huddling down out there. The others can''t get across yet. Time to fill up and relax."</p>\r\n<p>Davin flopped down into the chair Mawbek pushed out to him with a sigh and downed the cool water Burtak had poured into the mug beside the full plate in front of him.</p>\r\n<p>"I would ask how you''d slept if you didn''t look so awful," joked Mawbek but not without a deal of concern laced within the humour.</p>\r\n<p>"That... ''feeling''... still bothering you?" asked Rhodka.</p>\r\n<p>"That and other things," admitted Davin. "And even if it weren''t, this sudden inactivity would be. It''s not right," he glanced around the table. "They''ve been advancing all the time. Why stop right in front of their goal? That thing down there is up to something."</p>\r\n<p>"Which... ''thing''... in particular?" asked Ulrak.</p>\r\n<p>"The one with the ponytail skull and the shield," answered Davin picking up his fork, unable to resist the tempting aromas coming from the plate any longer.</p>\r\n<p>"Tajic did say he thought he saw it sneaking off last night," remarked Burtak, leaning forward with his elbows on the table.</p>\r\n<p>"Which way?" asked Rhodka, handing Davin his mug when the knight nearly choked trying to swallow the un-chewed food too quickly.</p>\r\n<p>"Off towards the Ridge... or so he thought. But it was still there come daylight so he thought he must have been mistaken."</p>\r\n<p>"It came back," nodded Davin firmly.</p>\r\n<p>"But why come back alone?" murmured Ulrak, watching with amused fascination as Davin’s brow creased so deeply that he thought the knight’s eyes might switch places.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know but I think we need to put everyone on extra alert," suggested Davin, pushing away his plate and getting to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Burtak and I can do that," insisted Mawbek, getting up himself and forcing Davin back into his chair. "You... Eat. We need you alert... not falling down with hunger."</p>\r\n<p>"I am al... " snapped Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"EAT!" Rhodka’s red beard bristled as he banged the edge of the table with a resounding thud and glowered at Davin over the froth of his ale. Then he winked and picked up a hunk of green cheese. "I''ll keep you company till you''ve finished and then we''ll make sure these two have done their jobs."</p>\r\n<p>Davin was not alone in his mistrust of the sudden inactivity. Many of the men found it worse than the constant fighting. Their voices grated harshly in the loud silence and they began speaking in hushed whispers. Faces drawn with fixed frowns looked down uneasily at the mass of unmoving bodies that seemed to have turned to stone they were so still. The light drifting of snowflakes fluttered listlessly from the sky with a reluctant hesitation, as if their presence might disturb the sleeping giant that lay upon the land. Muffled footsteps hurried from building to building as everyone went about their business in subdued quiet. As the day wore on the lively ringing of hammers on anvils became slower, more deliberate, as the hand numbed under the growing heaviness of heart of each individual. A smile became a rare sight that, more often than not, prompted a sour frown or a sharp tongue rather than a friendly reply. Perversely, now that they had the opportunity, everyone found it almost impossible to sleep in the air of nervous tension that pervaded the confines of the town like the mist that rolled off the river in the early dawn. </p>\r\n<p>Davin spent his time walking the length of the walls. Checking for damage. Talking with the watch. Trying to spot any kind of secretive movement from below that would give him some kind of clue as to what they were planning. He went with Rhodka to check the positioning of those guarding the two points where the river cut through the walls. Both seemed heavily guarded. Barges loaded with crossbows and bolts were tied in lines behind those filled with men and dwarves. The Soyex that had come upriver, were patrolling the east side and the pass and those on horseback were stationed in blocks along both sides of the bank to the west. Everything seemed in order but Davin was still not happy.</p>\r\n<p>"Rhodka, I''d like to double the men at both river areas, if that''s alright by you? And I''d like a few more at each bridge and a force stretching along the entire riverbank. Have we got enough people to do that without calling in any of the Soyex from outside?"</p>\r\n<p>"Plenty, though it will greatly diminish our number of reinforcements available," replied Rhodka thoughtfully. </p>\r\n<p>"What we could do is swap some of the men on the barges with some of the minor wounded. They might not be able to fight so well but they could do the loading."</p>\r\n<p>"Good idea. But not on the barges, they''re too exposed. Put them in those buildings over there and maybe some to shore up the numbers on the banks as well. And I think we should get some more supplies down here."</p>\r\n<p>"You think they''re going to try attacking through here again?" </p>\r\n<p>"It''s a vulnerable spot,” he nodded, “wouldn''t you? Any word from the Gypsies?" He asked,</p>\r\n<p>when Rhodka agreed that he would.</p>\r\n<p>"None. But that doesn''t mean they''ve run into any trouble." </p>\r\n<p>Rhodka stared up at Davin’s profile. His lips were a thin, hard line in his chiselled face. His nostrils flared slightly with each deliberate breath and a faint tic twitched in the taut muscles of his cheek, raw with cold. He held himself stiffly, as though he was having difficulty keeping himself under control, an observation confirmed by the way his fingers picked on the sleeve of his crossed arms, betraying his anxiety. Rhodka wished there was something he could do to lighten the knights'' load but ones'' emotions were ones'' own. He felt useless all of a sudden and it was reflected in the heavy sigh that ruffled his beard.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, we''ve done all we can here," Davin tried to sound casual. "No sense in brooding about what we can''t know. Let''s go back to the barracks and get warm. Maybe some ale and a hot meal will help us think of something we might have missed. We won''t have much time for either when the fighting starts again.</p>\r\n<p>The chill fell from the wind and took the bite from the air but the sudden clemency soon proved a curse rather than a blessing as the snow, piled along the edges of the streets, turned to a stream of slush and mud that there was no avoiding. Not even the best-made boots could keep the icy water out and the sound of squelching feet was added to the growing moroseness of mood. The sleeting rain almost obscured the huddled enemy and tempers rose with straining eyes, strung nerves and sodden bodies. The purple-black clouds (the width of which someone might have measured with infinite accuracy) that crept southwards with irritating slowness emptied their load with uncanny deliberation over the silent battlefield. Above the dry land on either side, the clear sky was deepening into darkness as the western horizon tightened on a thin band of scarlet. As the last petal of the sun shrivelled and died, the clouds broke and one by one, the stars twinkled their silvery greetings to the earth below.</p>\r\n<p>Burtak squinted into the night. Nothing seemed to have changed. The long line of creatures was still motionless in front of the smouldering ditch. Further back it was difficult tell what the rest was up to. He lifted his arm and sent Mirka aloft. He soon lost sight of her, as she rose quietly into the shadows beyond the flickering torches. She reappeared, lighting calmly on his shoulder and began to preen her ruffled feathers. Burtak stroked his finger lightly over her head and wished he could smooth away his own frown so easily.</p>\r\n<p>"Nothing?" Rhodka’s quiet voice coming up behind him, made Burtak jump and Mirka screech her protests as she lifted herself gracefully to a more solid perch.</p>\r\n<p>"Not a peep," Burtak told him, taking another squint over the wall.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t like this. I don''t like this, at all!" Rhodka shook his head. "There''s quiet and there''s too quiet. Are you about to go off?"</p>\r\n<p>"Yes Sir... unless you need anything else?" </p>\r\n<p>"No, go get some rest but first, tell Mawbek, I want everyone except this watch, dressed and armed ready to go. And tell the next watch to bring extra supplies with them."</p>\r\n<p>"That itch in Davin’s belly is getting contagious," Burtak smiled wryly, rubbing his own spreading paunch before he turned and hurried down the steps.</p>\r\n<p>At that moment, the itch in Davin’s belly felt more like a snarling wolf, crouched and ready to leap. The Dragonmark on his arm was warm and tingling uncomfortably beneath his woollen shirt. He had tried visiting Saroya but unable to contain his anxieties under polite talk for long, had left and made his way back towards the barracks. The ground crunched beneath his feet &mdash; the rain that had warmed the earlier chill already beginning to freeze again on the edges of the puddles. He stopped for a while on the bridge and listened to the trickling chatter of the river below lapping gently against its banks. Leaning on the wooden rails he gazed down at the dark water dressed in silver sequins cast down from above, then lifted his eyes to the sparkling sea of the heavens, of which the first was but a poor reflection for all its beauty, and sighed softly into its mysterious depths. Within the quiet flow of the wind rode an air of suspense, whispering in shadowy echoes through the deserted streets of the watchful town. Davin laid his forehead on the cold wood. It felt good against the burning flesh of his tired mind but could not chase away the cloud of heavy responsibility and unsettling premonition that pressed on him, or quieten the nagging voice that repeated he was out of his depth and going to get a lot of good people killed. His thoughts turned yet again to Tynan and he regretted, not for the first time, sending his friend away. He had never needed him more than he did right now. </p>\r\n<p>''How selfish could he get,'' he scathed himself. ''Tynan might be badly hurt... or worse... and all he could think about was himself.'' </p>\r\n<p>He straightened up slowly, rubbing his neck and stretching his stiff shoulders, wincing as the bones cracked loudly in the silence. A faint rustle on the bank behind him snapped his head round sharply.</p>\r\n<p>"Shh,” a faceless voice hissed angrily.</p>\r\n<p>A dwarvish curse answered in a low whisper. </p>\r\n<p>Davin moved towards the sounds and dropped down.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s going on," he asked.</p>\r\n<p>"Sorry Sir, but I had to stretch my leg. It''s gone numb," explained the dwarf.</p>\r\n<p>"How long have you been here?" Davin frowned, knowing it was not in dwarvish nature to complain unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p>"Since this morning Sir. I guess they forgot... what with everything and all," replied the dwarf.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll get you some replacements right now," promised Davin, getting to his feet and striding out across the bridge to the softly glowing windows of the buildings opposite. The muffled voices inside stopped as he lifted the latch and opened the door.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly the night was ripped asunder. An explosion of shouts rose up from the river and at the same time, a trumpet blew the alarm that the enemy was attacking the wall. With a rivalling explosion of expletives, Davin bellowed at those inside to get moving and raced along the waterfront. It was difficult to see exactly what was happening in the chaos but as he drew his sword and plunged into the battle, he quickly became aware that all his previous experiences amounted to no more than boyish skirmishes compared to the brutal carnage being carried out on all sides. </p>\r\n<p>The noise was deafening. Running feet stamped beneath the shouting cries of battle, the ringing clash of metal on metal, the ''twang'' of bows and the thud of bolts. The dwarvish tongue boomed in challenge and was answered by low, bestial snarls carried on the stench of rancid breath and mingling with the smell of blood and sweat, that was as thick as the acrid smoke that eddied and swirled around the mass of fighters, clogging the throat and making the eyes water. Arrows and bolts whistled through the night. Grotesque shadows writhed in the pulsing light of the fires that raged in the warehouses, where he had earlier stationed the extra archers and who were now effectively trapped, but who continued their assault until claimed by the flaming hand of death. The advance line of barges, also aflame, hissed as they sank beneath the surface of the dark waters, leaving the bodies of those they had carried to float, facedown on the current, towards the pass. In order to save the remaining barges, the men on board had been forced to cut them free from their moorings and paddle further out into the middle of the river. But this made it more difficult to pick out their targets without endangering their own people. Bodies lay everywhere. Bruised and battered, cut and broken. Wounded lay groaning amongst the dead until their voices too, were cut off in gurgling cries.</p>\r\n<p>Forced to fight open combat, some with not even a shield to protect them, the defenders were suffering horrendous losses despite having superiority of numbers. Crossbows were useless in such close quarters and the dwarves were forced to fight with sword and axe. Though they hacked, thrust and jabbed with all their skill, trying to penetrate inside the long-armed reach of the goblins, many fell without reward for their efforts, their blood staining the streets with puddles. The lines of their bodies a grim witness as to the ease with which the goblins were pushing deeper into the town. It was evident to Davin that, stout hearted as they were, the dwarves were outmatched by the stronger, long-armed goblins. Though they had managed to fell some of the enemy, it had only been through a tremendous loss of dwarven life and they had been forced to withdraw far deeper into the town than they could have imagined, in a surprisingly short space of time. It did not take an experienced mind to realise that all their carefully laid plans were being ripped to shreds. They were losing &mdash; pure and simple. </p>\r\n<p>''And if they weren''t careful, they were going to end up trapped between two, hostile forces.'' </p>\r\n<p>The thought flashed through Davin’s mind as he dodged the incoming swing of a goblin club, deflecting the blow with his sword so that it merely glanced off his lower arm. Still, it had enough force to shatter the bone and excruciating pain, dropped Davin to one knee. He cowered as the goblin raised his club for another swing but the expected blow did not connect. The goblin grunted in surprise and Davin glanced up to see it topple backwards, a dwarvish throwing axe embedded in its face. He felt an arm slip under his good shoulder and haul him to his feet. Ulrak’s voice bellowed loudly in his ear and another came to help him to safety. Outside the field of battle, Davin told the dwarf to stop. He leaned back against the wall and, rubbing the blood and grime from his eyes, surveyed the gruesome scene still unfolding. Even in the darkness the sight was devastating.</p>\r\n<p>Struggling to remain conscious, Davin signalled to the dwarf to come closer. Gasping with pain he forced out new orders. The dwarf was to go back and find Ulrak and tell him fresh barricades were to be erected with whatever could be found. Every ten paces along the waterfront as far as the bridge and up the streets that led into the town. It was imperative this was done quickly, since the enemy had almost reached the end of the warehouses. Bowmen and archers in rows of three... spears if there were not enough arrows... anything long range. They had to hold the enemy back long enough for those at the wall to get clear. The dwarf was also to send a messenger to Mawbek there, telling him the situation. The wall was to be abandoned. He was to get everyone back across the bridge, bringing only what they had with them, there was no time for an ordered withdrawal. </p>\r\n<p>"Sir? Are you sure?" asked the dwarf, looking at the beads of pain that sweated upon the knights forehead and wondering if Davin knew what he was saying.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sure," he nodded, then was forced to pause as a wave of dizziness swept over him and he slid down the wall. He reached up and squeezed the dwarf’s arm, his words straining through gritted teeth. </p>\r\n<p>"Make sure they understand it has to be done quickly, while I''m still conscious... " he had to pause again, concentrating on staying awake until the fresh wave of dizziness passed. "... while I can still use the Dragonmark. I don''t know how long I''ll be out for once I go." He tried to smile but it fell into a flat grimace as he groaned and his eyes rolled white. The dwarf slapped him hard about the face and Davin heard him calling for help. Anxious voices murmured unintelligibly in his ear, then there was the sound of running feet. Riding on a sea of blackness, Davin grasped the dwarfs'' arm and pulled him closer.</p>\r\n<p>"Forget Ulrak," he croaked. "Give the orders yourself, in my name... and Rhodka’s. And be quick!"</p>\r\n<p>Icy water splashed on his face and he shivered as he was pulled to his feet, stumbling over numb legs that refused to behave, as he was half carried, half dragged, away from the noise and stench of the battle. The gruff voice that urged him to hold on and stay awake gave way to rough but gentle hands that caressed his cheek and a frightened voice that scalded his ears until he opened blurred eyes and smiled a pathetic smile. </p>\r\n<p>"Saroya, my love," the words of endearment slipping unconsciously off his tongue, "I never knew you knew such words," he gibed weakly.</p>\r\n<p>"And more you''ll hear if you don''t stop this nonsense and let me help you," she warned crossly, pushing a mug to his lips. He recognised the smell and pushed it away.</p>\r\n<p>"I have to stay awake. Later, I''m all yours. Help me up."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re a stubborn fool," she rounded curtly but helped him sit and stayed with him, bathing his head and giving him water and talking to him to keep his mind awake and his eyes open.</p>\r\n<p>Before the harsh blare of the trumpet had died away, the catapults had begun firing into the midst of the reunited horde stampeding towards the wall. However this time the enemy did not panic and break, for Ishtak had interspersed his goblins amongst the ranks of the gracht to keep them in line and push them forward, regardless of what was going on around them. Soon they were hammering at the wall itself and it shuddered violently under the heavy blows of the great axes and clubs they wielded. But Zafchak was not so easily shattered and their blows bounced off, just as the defenders'' arrows bounced off grachtan hides. </p>\r\n<p>On and on, the enemy pounded relentlessly at the black Zafchak and just as relentlessly, those above poured all they could down upon their heads. Arrows, spears and bolts whistled back and forth in the darkness. Cries of pain broke the stream of grunts and curses from above and the guttural growls from below. Someone managed to shout a warning before the cry was suddenly cut off in a choked gurgle. A huge figure reared up in the torchlight, swamping the diminutive dwarves that confronted it and sending them crashing to the ground below with one mighty sweep of its tail. Burtak lit an arrow and took aim for the open, jeering snout. He fired and the arrow twanged with satisfaction from his bow to slip effortlessly down the grachts'' exposed throat. Its eyes widened in surprise and it dropped its weapon to claw at the feathered shaft that tapped against its teeth. Axes arcing, the dwarves rushed in and pushed the dying body over the edge. But it was not the only one and there was no time for congratulations as the battle continued to rage in waves of escalation and withdrawal and yet without pause for breath. </p>\r\n<p>Fires blazed all around &mdash; from torchlight to buildings. Upon the wall and on the ground below, as the goblins made use of the fire cast down upon them to hurl burning brands back into the town. There were bodies everywhere. Running bodies, crawling bodies, dead and dying bodies, bodies carrying weapons and water to the fighters above, bodies carrying the wounded across the bridges to the safety of the north bank. And from the bodies came a multitude of voices all shouting, groaning, calling for supplies, calling for help, crying out alarm or calling for reinforcements. And in the midst of this chaos, Davin’s messenger came wheezing up to Mawbek and Rhodka, gasping the news of the imminent defeat at the river and the call for withdrawal.</p>\r\n<p>Though surprised by the message, Rhodka did not hesitate to act upon it. Zafchak was strong but it was not invulnerable and could not last forever against the incessant pounding to which it was being subjected. Eventually it would crack and fall. Admittedly they had thought it would take a lot longer but they had already planned for when that time came. And part of that plan was Davin. When Rhodka heard that the knight had been sorely wounded, he cursed him loudly for putting himself in such danger.&nbsp;Still, what was done was done. Finding Burtak, he sent Mirka with a message to the Soyex, at the other end of the river, asking for a diversionary attack to distract the enemy’s'' attention away from what was happening above. He did not waste time waiting for the Soyex to respond but began sending the first of his men back, loading them as heavily as possible with supplies. Hooves thundered around the outskirts of the wall and he hurried aloft. The Soyex came flashing into sight, loosened hair flying, and screaming to the wind like the mythical sirens of the seas. Had he not known their preference for the ship, Rhodka would have sworn they were born in the saddle but as Saroya had explained, the horse was as near to a Gahyashi as they could get on land and they needed something to pass the time when riding the winter waves became impossible. Sitting well back on their mounts and guiding only with their knees, the Raiders galloped fearlessly into the faces of the startled gracht, releasing their bolts and then rearing their horses in a tight wheel. A second and third wave already galloping passed them as they withdrew to re-load. Spears arced high over the front ranks, less to do damage (since they had little force to penetrate the grachtan hides and only by pure chance could one be expected to find a soft spot) than to provoke reaction.</p>\r\n<p>Just as Rhodka had hoped, many of the creatures lost interest in the wall when offered the prospect of easier, open targets. Pre-loading a goodly number of the multi-firing crossbows and loading the catapults to their fullest capacity, he was able to release a large proportion of his remaining men to safety. Burtak went with them. As soon as they reached the bridge he sent Mirka aloft and at her circling cry, Rhodka signalled the trumpet to send the Soyex on their way also. He launched one, last counter-attack, flinging everything he had left over the parapet, and finally, ordering the catapults to be torched, he and the last of the defenders raced down the steps and up the deserted streets. The wall shook and shuddered behind them as the enemy realised there was no longer any resistance and increased their assault. The reverberations rumbled through the ground beneath the feet of the fleeing dwarves.</p>\r\n<p>Stepping out of the final alley onto the waterfront, Rhodka could scarce believe the scene of slaughter that befell him. A multitude of his kinsmen and friends littered the blood-soaked cobbles like so much carrion. The words of Palach stung his mind even as the tears stung his horrified eyes. He cursed the words and spat upon them. There was no glory here, no honour, only death &mdash; death and the gut-tearing, mind-screaming nausea of futility and emptiness. Emptiness echoed in the glazed, spiritless eyes of the dead. Yet even as he surveyed the grisly scene, life rose anew in the dawn sun. But she too sorrowed at the sight and red, morning light seeped slowly across the sky like tears of blood streaming down pale blue cheeks. Wiping his own tears away, Rhodka emerged from his momentary melancholia into the noise of grim reality. Voices returned, urging him to hurry across the bridge. But he turned instead to the battle. Thrusting his way into the throng of mayhem, calling to his people on the edges of the conflict and those manning the barricades to retreat. His own intention was to stay with those in the midst of the fighting. To keep the enemy at bay while Davin used the Dragonmark. The dwarf nearest to him grabbed his arm and pulled him back. Torn and bloody, he did not recognise Ulrak until the young Kata spoke, telling Rhodka that the First Kata was far more important than himself and that he, Ulrak, would remain in command. Rhodka should go, quickly, since Ulrak knew Davin was in poor shape even before the long wait of withdrawal. To forestall any argument or direct order to the contrary, Ulrak dove into the thick of battle and disappeared from sight. To make sure he went, Ulrak sent another dwarf to drag Rhodka back across the bridge, with orders to knock him out and carry him if he had too. With a heavy heart, Rhodka allowed himself to be led. He dropped wearily beside Davin.</p>\r\n<p>"What about the others?" asked Saroya.</p>\r\n<p>"They will do what they must," he replied flatly and turned his attention to Davin. </p>\r\n<p>The knight was in a bad way. His skin was grey and beaded with sweat, his lips white and his eyes red and swimming in and out of focus. His shattered left arm was swollen almost twice its size and caked in blackening blood and when Rhodka helped him to the rivers'' edge, he found him burning with fever. Saroya’s chin trembled and she turned her frightened gaze aside as Rhodka tore the cloth away from the Dragonmark and Davin cried out in pain and drifted into delirium.</p>\r\n<p>Gently at first and then with more force, Rhodka slapped Davin’s cheeks to pull him back. </p>\r\n<p>"Tynan? S''at you?" Gis slurred words rambled as he clung weakly to Rhodka’s arm.</p>\r\n<p>"Where''ve you been? I needed you. Wha''sin that bottle? I think I''m dying."</p>\r\n<p>"Davin? Davin? Wake up. It''s Saroya. You''re not dying Davin. Wake up." </p>\r\n<p>Saroya’s voice rose hysterically in her panic, as Davin slid to one side and lay motionless in the wet grass. She dragged his head up by his hair and shook it enough to break his neck until Rhodka stopped her.</p>\r\n<p>"Davin," she shouted, her fear turning to anger. "You bilge-born son of a land bound hag. You open you eyes right now and speak to me or I''ll... "</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka’s mouth dropped open and he was only thankful that, after the first few words, Saroya tripped into her own tongue and he was spared the more colourful rendition of her promised retribution. A faint whisper snapped him out of his shock and he looked down to see Davin lean his forehead against Saroya’s lips to still her flow.</p>\r\n<p>"When this is over we''re going to work on that tongue of yours," he tapped her lips with his finger. "Most unladylike."</p>\r\n<p>"For as long as you want," she laughed and kissed his palm. "But first you have to do what you must and then I can take proper care of you."</p>\r\n<p>"I''d like that. Let me talk to Tynan now."</p>\r\n<p>"Tynan isn''t here, Davin. It''s Rhodka," said Saroya, quickly splashing water over Davin’s face, fearful they were losing him again.</p>\r\n<p>"That old red bull? Half the size and twice the man of any I know," he tapped the side of his nose, "except Tynan of course. Not like him to be late?" He frowned and twisted his head to look about him.</p>\r\n<p>"You''d better hurry," warned Saroya.</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka nodded and, gently as he could, laid Davin face down so that the Dragonmark rested against the ground. He was just about to tell Davin he must say whatever words he needed to say to activate the power, when a nearby voice cried out.</p>\r\n<p>"Kata... Wait! Something''s happening. Look!"</p>\r\n<p>Across the river, the goblins were behaving very strangely. Their bestial snarls had turned to tones of angry surprise. They were stamping their feet, jumping up and down and they appeared to have forgotten about the dwarves in their midst to wave weapon-less hands about their faces and bodies. Rhodka stood up and stepped onto the bridge for a closer look. He grabbed at his beard in amazement as the goblins were suddenly engulfed in a tidal wave of gnawing fur.</p>\r\n<p>The rats that had previously followed the gracht upriver, had hidden in the foothills of the Ridge when they had been destroyed and watched and waited, to see what would unfold. They had seen the goblins creeping up upon the town and in turn, had crept along behind them. They joined with their cousins from the waterfront, who were also watching, biding their time. The rallying spirit of the short two-legs, who refused to give up in the face of overwhelming odds, intrigued them and they admired the unselfish sacrifice of those who were willing to stay behind to ensure the lives of the others of their family. It had surprised them at first, to see the two-legs display a side of themselves that was so rat-like in nature. And gradually they begun to feel a certain kinship, with these select few at least, and deemed them worthy of their assistance. They swept silently into the empty streets, moving rapidly through the debris of battle and fell upon the unsuspecting goblins. Their numbers were vast. Their speed and ferocity diminished only by their size in respect to their quarry. And they attacked with all the hatred of countless ages and the fermented desire for revenge, for all that generations of their family had suffered in Ak''thai.</p>\r\n<p>The dwarves still engaged in fighting the goblins'' were in a state of bewilderment. Thankfully, they were all quick to note that the rats obviously meant them no harm and so did not raise their hands against them. In fact, to their great surprise, the rats seemed to be herding them back &mdash; back away from the fighting, back towards the bridge. One by one they started to turn, to look for orders from the other side of the river.</p>\r\n<p>"Well, don''t just stand there!" Rhodka’s voice bellowed from the bridge with not a trace of the bemusement he felt. As the last man passed he caught his arm. "Ulrak?"</p>\r\n<p>The dwarf shook his head sadly. Rhodka’s fingers tightened over the top of the axe tucked into his belt. He told the dwarf to go on and hitching up his breeches, strode back to Davin and Saroya, whose shimmering eyes pleaded with him to hurry. He lay himself down and pressed Davin’s arm to the earth and told to him to say the words. Davin moaned. His eyes flickered open and stared at Rhodka with blank confusion. </p>\r\n<p>"The words, Sir Davin. The words for the Dragonmark," and avoiding Saroya’s accusing gaze he deliberately squeezed Davin’s arm. Davin cried out in agony but for a few moments was lucid and alert to what was needed, though his hoarse whisper barely disturbed the blades of grass beside his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Dragon’s Power harken me. Mother’s arm let Dragonmark be.</p>\r\n<p>Rising high, I thee implore; Cast thy shadow upon yonder shore." </p>\r\n<p>"Is it done?" Saroya demanded of the ensuing silence. Rhodka shrugged. He had no idea.</p>\r\n<p>Then the ground began to tremble. The surface of the river rippled. Tiny droplets of water splashed upwards, so that the whole river was suddenly alive with dancing spume. And then the earth heaved beneath them, throwing them off the ground. The motion rolled passed and was replaced by a violent shaking. A deep groan burrowed its way up through the earth, bursting free in a great geyser of dirt and rock.</p>\r\n<p>"Back... back," Davin managed to croak, before he finally blacked out.</p>\r\n<p>His companions backed off. Suddenly, the entire, north bank of the river thrust itself skyward and obliterated all that had been the southern horizon. And then it was over. The ground stilled, as though the upheaval had never been. As Rhodka and the other dwarves on the bank crept closer to the edge to view the outcome, Saroya beckoned those who had accompanied her, to carry Davin to her lodgings. Nothing else mattered to her now but his recovery. </p>\r\n<p>On the south bank, Ishtak (who had in the meantime broken through the wall) arrived just in time to see the incredible event. When he was able to stand again, he threw his arms into the air &mdash; his wrath uncontrollable, his frustration insatiable. He dived into the calming</p>\r\n<p>violence of the river and swam to the far shore. He tried to haul himself up the other side but the earth slipped away from his grasp, the soft shale refusing to provide a handhold. Wet and cold he pulled himself back to the opposite shore and disappeared alone into the nearest building, to rage as to why everything had suddenly gone so drastically wrong... only just managing to stop short of questioning the infallible supremacy of the Great Father, upon whose information and advice he had formed all his strategies! </p>\r\n<p>All day he stayed there, fuming and brooding. None dared to enter his presence. And for a while the defenders of Rohansuk were gifted, not only the protection of the towering bank, but some welcome respite, to rest and eat and regain their strength, but not for long. The attacks began again at sunset. The enemy testing this new obstacle in their path to find a way to conquer it... and those secreted behind. </p>\r\n<p>And so, west and east, the fighting continued day after day and through the long, cold nights, draining strength, exhausting supplies. Wearing down the will and stamina of the Mother’s children as they struggled against an enemy that refused to quit, scorned rest, ignored injury and whose numbers seemed immune to depletion. </p>\r\n<p>Day after day, Death cast her nets upon the land... and her catch was many.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 26, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(49, 'A drowsy start', 'CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="S" src="S.gif">ula had been so excited on the journey to the plateau. Gwym had talked almost non-stop and she had loved listening and learning about her new family and people and looked forward to meeting them. Somewhere along the way, she had started to believe they would all be exactly like Gwym. When they did arrive, all her fantasies fell apart.<p></p>\r\n<p>Silent stares had followed her across the plateau to the Sharran’s caravan, where the chieftains of the gipsy tribes had congregated. They had greeted her with polite courtesy (apart from Eona who had met her with open arms, she remembered with a shy smile) but with an aloofness that baffled and confused her, since she had never encountered it before and did not know how to respond. Yet neither had they shown open hatred (like the man Tanner) and, true to Gwym’s word, from that meeting onward the tribes had defended her vehemently against all slights, real or assumed, from those non-gipsies taking refuge there. Gradually, as everyone became accustomed to seeing her about and the strangeness of her features faded before the emergence of her quiet and gentle nature, many began to treat her just like anyone else. Still, there were those non-gypsies who kept their distance and to whom she was remained one of the enemy. But they were careful to keep all their opinions of suspicions and disgust amongst themselves, whispering behind her back when she was alone and there were no gipsies within earshot. For Sula this was more hurtful and disturbing that any overt hostility. </p>\r\n<p>It did not seem proper to complain, lest she be thought ungrateful for what Gwym had done for her and so she had taken to sitting alone on the quiet slopes of the Ridge, to get away from the staring eyes and twisted lips and to think, while she waited for Velkaan. She had been here when Davin had used the Dragonmark and had watched with awe as the mighty earth had risen up and created the great wall before the water. She had wondered then, why such a powerful force did not simply sweep away the enemy that threatened her children. She thought about it now. Carefully considering and comparing all the information Gwym had given her about the Mother and her different children, that lived together on the surface of the earth, against her own experiences of being a goblin and she was unable to hide from the truth any longer. The Great Father was bad! </p>\r\n<p>In fact, he was not a true father at all. He did not really care for his children or love them, as the Mother loved hers. He told them lies. Twisted their minds so that he could use them for his own purposes. A father did not send his children out to die. He did not pit them against each other, as she had watched him do with Ishtak and Ishkat, for his own amusement. A good father did not deliberately breed hatred into the blood of his children. Or instil the lust to kill in their hearts. A good father, like Gwym, wept at the death of his child and grieved with the fathers of other lost children. Held his children with tenderness and eased their hurts and pains and taught them to love and respect others that shared this earth. Fighting and killing was not the beginning for these children of the Mother, she began to understand but the last resort, when all else failed and survival was all that mattered. </p>\r\n<p>For the goblins, it was the killing that mattered. This made the goblins bad but it was not really their fault. It was Duman’s fault. He was the evil one. The goblins were simply misguided &mdash; deadly so, she admitted, but not by choice... by dishonest teaching. These thoughts had always been with her deep down. She realised it now. That was why she had asked questions in the Great Hall, why she had been forever asking questions. Why she had run away through the tunnels to seek out this ''enemy'' &mdash; to search for the truth. Now, having finally found it, she broke the last remnant of fear that bound her to Duman and in so doing, threw away the guilt of disloyalty to her goblin race that had dogged her since she had saved Velkaan. </p>\r\n<p>And as she sat there, in her favourite spot, her exceptional sight trained down on the ruined town of Talgheer, she made her first decision as a gypsy. She could not see everything in detail, even she was too far away for that, but she could see enough to know that those who defended what was left were in grave peril. She got up and ran back to Eona’s caravan where Malinka was sitting on the steps, deftly slipping her needle in and out of the torn hem of the skirt she was mending. She barely glanced up as Sula approached.</p>\r\n<p>"Sla need see sister Ona," said Sula, politely.</p>\r\n<p>"She''s resting," replied Malinka and continued her sewing.</p>\r\n<p>"Is portant. Please," insisted Sula, chewing her lip as Malinka continued to ignore her. Short of sweeping the old woman right off the step (which she could have done quite easily it has to be said), she was at a loss.</p>\r\n<p>"Sula? Is that you?" Eona’s voice called out from behind the curtained doorway. "Come in!"</p>\r\n<p>Tutting loudly, Malinka rolled up her mending and moved aside to allow Sula to pass. Sula thanked her and smiled, taking no offence at the old woman’s'' abrasive attitude. Malinka was like that with everyone, even Gwym.</p>\r\n<p>"Sister Ona. Need speak. Men below in big danger." Sula blurted out her concerns abruptly. "Little men think safe behind tall wall. Not safe. Goblin not go over... then go through. Tunnel, yes? Come out behind. Goblin tunnel gud. Quick. Used tunnel. Tunnel home. This ground soft... not rock like home. Make tunnel one day, maybe two when start. Ona tell little men run. Not stay. Kill... eat, if stay." She finally stopped for breath.</p>\r\n<p>Sula’s accent thickened and became more guttural in her agitation and Eona could tell, by the movement of the air in the caravan, that her arms were waving wildly to add emphasis to her words. Eona sat quietly, certain that there was more than this on the goblins'' mind to account for her distress. Sula was pacing now, back and forth the length of the caravan, surprisingly lightly for such a heavy-boned, large-footed creature. A moments'' silent and the chair next to Eona scraped back from the table and Sula at last sat down beside her.</p>\r\n<p>"What you think? Goblins bad?"</p>\r\n<p>"That depends," replied Eona slowly, choosing her words very carefully, "on the goblin. I don''t know that many but I expect there are good and bad, as in all races."</p>\r\n<p>"Sla think too,” exclaimed Sula, banging her hand down on the table in her excitement. "Sla know Ona unstand. Sla work out. Goblin not help be bad. Great Fa... Duman," she corrected herself, "speak many untruths of Mother’s childen. Turn head... No," she shook her head. " Turn mind. But not Sla. Sla ask. All time ask. All time mother hit, tell Sla not-speak," she cuffed herself about the ear.</p>\r\n<p>Eona was beginning to guess where this was going but she allowed Sula to finish before offering any opinion.</p>\r\n<p>"Sla think... if Sla not bad... then may be more... not bad. Childen like Sla. Learn truth. Be gud." Her tone was an endearing mix of certainty, doubt and pleading... and now she looked to Eona for the answer. Eona sighed deeply. If half of what she had heard about these goblins was true, then Sula, with her gentle heart and inquiring mind, was nothing short of a miracle. Yet Sula’s argument did give food for thought. Without Duman’s evil influence maybe it would be possible to teach the goblins other ways. Not the adults perhaps and she doubted strongly that those massed in Talgheer and at Symtar, would be amiable to rehabilitation. But maybe there was hope for children. Sula herself was proof that somewhere, in some surely, there was another aspect to their nature. It was just a matter of bringing it to the fore. Though nobody had yet brought the matter up, it was a problem that had troubled her greatly. What to do with the remainder of the goblin race if, by some slim chance, the Races did manage to win this war. ''Total annihilation''... were words she was sure, rested on the hearts of many. She sighed heavily. Like Sula, she so wanted to believe they were capable of redemption but she could not raise false hopes in the troubled goblin. She took Sula’s hand and held it tightly.</p>\r\n<p>"You must understand that such matters are far out of my hands. Though they may seem so, the gipsy tribes are not a race apart. They have no homeland to call their own, no authority and no influence outside their own sphere. Others will decide the future, depending on the outcome of this war. But if all goes well for us, then I promise you that I will use the friendships I have made, especially with the Powerwielder and Dragon Knights, to persuade them that not all goblins should be made to pay for the actions of those who have taken up arms against us. If there''s a chance we can teach some the truth and to live in peace with us, then I will not rest until we have done it."</p>\r\n<p>Sula listened and understood. She knew Eona spoke the truth about others more important than herself. She knew Eona was sincere in her promise to help. She also heard the unspoken words between the lines that those goblins that were part of the enemy army would, without doubt, face the consequences. But she accepted this, knowing they would not be able to change anyway. For them, it was win or die. There were no other choices... for everyone’s sake. </p>\r\n<p>"Sla happy now. Sister Ona have more power than know. Sla listen all time. Tall men and small men. All give much listen to word of Sharran." She grinned at the flash of surprise that crossed Eona’s face and squeezed her hand gently. "Now Sla tell rest. Goblin live dark. Eyes not like hurt-light... Sun? Duman give magic, sun not hurt. Sla not have magic. Eyes learn to live sun. Sla think others not do same-like. Sla tell Ona. Maybe magic not same-gud as learn live. Maybe men use sun. Make hurt-light goblin eye. Can help?"</p>\r\n<p>"I think we can find a way to use that information," replied Gwym from the doorway. "Malinka said you wanted to see me?" he crossed the room and kissed Eona on the head before slipping into the chair on the other side of her.</p>\r\n<p>"Malinka is getting far too sure of herself," snapped Eona, smiling as the door closed quickly.</p>\r\n<p>She turned her head to face Gwym and ran through all that she and Sula had been discussing. When she had finished, Sula stunned them both by announcing she was going down to the enemy encampment.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a good idea Sula. And well thought out," agreed Eona recovering quickly. "But I can''t allow you to go. One of the soldiers maybe, but not you. It''s far too dangerous for someone so young and inexperienced." </p>\r\n<p>Sula was crestfallen. She had been pleased when she had come up with the plan. It was something she knew she could do to help and to prove herself. She refused to give up.</p>\r\n<p>"But Sla only one can go. Sla be safe," she insisted. "Goblin not see Sla... see goblin. Other go... goblin see enemy. Sla perfek," she grinned broadly.</p>\r\n<p>"You''re not seriously considering this?" Gwym turned to Eona in amazement when the immediate refusal failed to come.</p>\r\n<p>"We have to," replied Eona, though she made no effort to hide her reluctance for it. "This may be the only chance we have of turning this thing around."</p>\r\n<p>"It''s madness! I''m supposed to be looking after her, not sending her off on some suicide mission," he argued hotly.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s not really your decision father. It''s Sula’s... and mine. If she thinks she can do it without getting hurt," she emphasized strongly towards Sula, "then I think we have to let her try.”</p>\r\n<p>"Sula," Gwym leant across the table and took Sula’s hand. "I''m asking you to think very clearly. Please, don''t do this."</p>\r\n<p>"Sla must do. Must help. Sla know goblin. Too strong too deep bloodlust for gypsy... for dorf... for sox. Brave not nuf. All die... Sla not do."</p>\r\n<p>The fixed certainty of her expression and the bland matter-of-fact tone, with which she spoke of her previous kinsmen, left no hope that she might be exaggerating. A cold chill raced through the blood of her listeners. </p>\r\n<p>"Dear Mother," breathed Eona.</p>\r\n<p>"Ona not worry. Goblin not-now famly Sla. Gipsy family. Father Gwym, sister Ona, Velkn frind. Now famly Sla. Sla not let goblin kill. Sla not-die too. Go in... come out. Dorf... sox... make big fight. Make all better. Live happy famly." She smiled brightly.</p>\r\n<p>Gwym envied her the childish innocence of her conclusions. If only he could see with such black and white certainty. Unfortunately, his mind was a grey area where everything that could go wrong did so, with desperate and tragic consequences. He looked at Eona, at the set mask of her face, the rigid line of her back and shoulders and the hand clasped tightly in Sula’s. During the short time Sula had been on the plateau, the two of them had developed a deep bond (perhaps because of the strangeness of each that set them apart from others) and he knew that Eona, despite her earlier firmness, had no more desire to send Sula on this mission than he had to see her go. It was heart-versus-common sense decision. He pulled himself together, she would be furious to sense his pity.</p>\r\n<p>"Is there nothing I can say to change your mind?" he asked Sula, hoping to spare Eona the decision. Sula shook her head firmly. "Then we must plan."</p>\r\n<p>"Must be soon. Goblin not wait," Sula insisted.</p>\r\n<p>"We will need today to send a message to Rhodka," said Gwym thoughtfully. "Another for him to prepare. How long will it take Malinka to gather enough herbs?"</p>\r\n<p>"If I know Malinka she''s already been round half the camp," Eona replied loudly, a smile twitching the corner of her mouth as she heard footsteps scurrying down the caravan steps. Malinka had a tendency to ''anticipate'' Eona’s needs from outside the door, which Eona overlooked for the benefit of, saved time, since she knew Malinka was totally trustworthy and would not dream of using the privilege of Eona’s leniency for personal gain. </p>\r\n<p>"Father, go and speak to Eiva. I want every woman helping. The herbs are generally stored whole and will need crushing and mixing, as well as gathering. Tell Ador to send the messenger now and then call our men together and send them too, as soon as they''re ready. Rhodka will need all the help he can get." </p>\r\n<p>"But... "</p>\r\n<p>"If things go badly down there it won''t matter," she said before he could start arguing about leaving the plateau unguarded.</p>\r\n<p>Rising from his chair, Gwym kissed them both on the top of the head and left. Sula remained with Eona, tending to her needs in the absence of Malinka until the other woman returned.</p>\r\n<p>Two days later they gathered there again. This time with Ador and four other gipsy chieftains who, having heard what Sula was planning, had insisted on accompanying her down the pass where they would wait and cover her return. Sula argued volubly against it, but this time Eona overrode her. Scant as the protection of five gipsy against the enemy horde might be, she felt much better about the whole thing knowing Sula would not be totally alone.</p>\r\n<p>"You all go... or no-one goes," she warned softly and Sula knew she was beaten.</p>\r\n<p>They began their descent late afternoon, timing their arrival in the foothills for just after dark. Gwym closed his fingers over Sula’s earrings and watched anxiously as she rubbed dirt over her face and in the holes in her earlobes, settled the bag of sleeping herbs over her shoulder and set off along the final distance alone. She was soon lost in darkness. The messenger Ador had sent had returned with acknowledgement and agreement but they could only hope, Rhodka and the others would be ready on time. Enveloped in the night, tortured by memories of Tielan, Gwym began to wish he was one of them, instead of</p>\r\n<p>sitting uselessly on the cold rock consumed by images of Sula suffering at the hands of the beasts below.</p>\r\n<p>Sula too, was suffering her share of doubts. The closer she got to the groups of campfires, the more she could smell the fear within her rising. She glanced back over her shoulder,</p>\r\n<p>drawing comfort from the knowledge that the men were waiting there. Squatting down, she rubbed more dirt into her earlobes. She had avoided telling Gwym until the last moment that, small as the holes were, there was a possibility that a sharp-eyed goblin may notice them and get suspicious. Her teeth were another concern she had failed to mention but so long as she kept her mouth shut, no-one would notice they were not sharpened. If they did, she would most definitely be in trouble, no goblin child would be allowed out here. This, she did not mention to Gwym at all!</p>\r\n<p>She was there. She threw back her cloak, letting her female appearance be seen. It was rare any goblin spoke to the mate of another, which left her only the other creatures to worry about and they might not know the significance of unsharpened teeth... she hoped. She paused at the last edge of darkness, taking notice of the shadowy areas between the flickering lights of the separate campfires and picked her first target. A last check in her bag and she rubbed her sweaty palms down her legs and, in true, goblin female style, slipped unobtrusively into the first camp.</p>\r\n<p>Crouching down behind the sprawling gracht she looked about for vessels. She was in luck. They had a number of jugs, which they were filling from an open barrel set not far from her position. Creeping silently from back to back, she reached the barrel. Taking a handful of herbs she dropped them inside, as Malinka had instructed. Not enough to send them to sleep (there were not enough to go around as it was), just to make them groggy and slow by morning. As she was moving away she spotted an empty jug that had been thrown aside. Thinking this might make her task easier, she picked it up and rising slowly, dipped it into the barrel. A gracht to her left broke off his laughter and shouted gruffly at her. She froze. She had no idea what he was saying and so she merely growled as low as she could and to her relief, he turned his head away. She moved on, gaining confidence as she swapped jug for jug, lacing the contents and swapping it again. </p>\r\n<p>Remindful of her promise to Eona and Gwym, she picked her targets carefully. Avoiding those where it meant straying too deeply into the light and those where the occupants were more alert or where they were all snoring soundly and a creeping figure would attract attention. She worked as quickly as safety would allow, all the while keeping an eye on the eastern skyline and on the increasing numbers of goblins now evident in the horde. She changed her tactics, becoming more submissive. Keeping her head bowed and moving respectfully out of the way to let the males pass and mumbled about her mates'' displeasure to the rare questions that were thrown at her. Eventually she came to the last handful of herbs. She lifted her head and glanced about her, searching for the best choice of final target. Her eyes lit up. There was no mistaking the Generals camp, with the bright fire and the stiff guards stationed around it. Did she dare try it? Eona would be furious with her, Gwym equally so. But if she could get to the General and he was killed in the coming battle it would force the goblins into disarray, for they would begin fighting amongst themselves for leadership. She could not pass the opportunity by. </p>\r\n<p>Turning her back to the light of the camp, she dropped to her heels and, after checking both sides of the shadows carefully, slipped the remaining herbs into her jug and swilled them around. Her heart was thumping, her mouth dry and her knees knocking so badly that, as she rose and turned, she tripped over her own feet. Her heart sank as she went sprawling. But worse was to come. Instead of falling to the ground and seeing the precious contents spill from a broken jug, she felt rough hands reach out to steady her and heard an angry, commanding voice demanding explanation.</p>\r\n<p>"What you doing, skulking out here?"</p>\r\n<p>Sula looked up with dismay. Silence or muttered mumblings would not help her now she knew. Even one of lower status would at least try to stand her ground. Only a child would avoid confrontation with another female. She reached out to her only inspiration. </p>\r\n<p>''The best deception is woven with truth,'' Velkaan had once told her.</p>\r\n<p>So shrugging off the others'' grip, she thrust the jug forward.</p>\r\n<p>"Bring for General," she said loudly if not clearly, as she tried to keep her teeth hidden behind her thick lips. The female frowned and snarled suspiciously.</p>\r\n<p>"What wrong talk? What name? What do here?" She grabbed Sula’s hair and jerked back her head. Sula stared back in silence, biting down as hard as she could on her tongue as the female shook her roughly. Sula spat in her face. The female let go and backhanded her across the side of her head. The force of the blow sent Sula staggering backwards. This was no ordinary female she realised and her body resumed its shaking, this time of its own accord. </p>\r\n<p>"Am sorry," Sula apologized, bowing her head submissively. "Teeth new-sharp. Make talk hard. New mate. Make wrong to high-rank female. Better see. Not-do more."</p>\r\n<p>Letting the black blood dribble down her chin, Sula dared a quick glance up. The female continued to glare down at her but she no longer showed suspicion, only contempt and disgust and a flare of dismay. Sula might never have attained adulthood but she had seen enough of goblin life to know that this one would be kicking herself now, for failing to recognise and paying so much attention to a newly mated female worth little more than a child. Indeed she was already glancing about anxiously to ensure her stupidity had not been witnessed. </p>\r\n<p>"Go back mate. Tell teach better. Who mate?" the female asked after a short pause, lifting her chin arrogantly and placing her fists on her hips. " I speak. Make sure teach proper lesson."</p>\r\n<p>This was definitely no ordinary female, to assume she out-ranked a male enough to tell him how to control his mate. Sula swallowed hard, making no attempt to hide her fear. She was in deep water and floundering badly.</p>\r\n<p>"No goblin mate," she mumbled haltingly, hiding her face in her chest. "Mate gone."</p>\r\n<p>"Ha,” the female snorted, as though everything had suddenly been made clear, and grabbed the jug from Sula’s hands, sniffing the contents. "Stupid female," she cuffed Sula again and laughed contemptuously. "You think jump... No mate... Ishtak mate? Good for you Ishkat long ways. Kill very slow. Sempok, second command Ishkat. Maybe duty, kill her place. Even Ishkat gone, General not look low like you. Want strong mate," she thumped herself in the chest. "High-rank. Bring status... skill. Give strong offspring." Sempok’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully.</p>\r\n<p>"Like you," whispered Sula, feeding the idea that was obviously growing in Sempok’s mind and watching with relief as it dimmed the wicked gleam that the talk of killing Sula had aroused. Puffing out her chest and drawing herself to her full height, Sempok spun Sula about and kicked her in the back, sending her sprawling to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>"Go back children, where you belong," she sneered. "Sempok take jug to General." Sula already forgotten, by a mind flooded with the possibilities open should Ishkat (and her own mate) be killed in battle, Sempok strutted towards Ishtaks camp, thrust the guards aside and entered the tent. Crouched on the ground, Sula watched Sempok from beneath her armpit and then crawled quickly as she dared, through the shadowy lanes of the encampment, towards the Ridge. Getting out was far worse than getting in. With each footstep she expected to hear the cry of alarm or a heavy hand on her neck as the General, Sempok or some other, uncovered her deeds. She wanted to run. All the more so as she neared the outer limits and saw the relative safety of the climbing foothills beckoning her feet, which heightened rather than diminished her sense of danger, and felt a growing certainty that safety would be snatched from her grasp before she got there. At last she arrived at the last camp. Some of the gracht were still awake. She strode boldly through their midst, ignoring them and their unintelligible comments, to the barrel of ale. Hooking a jug with one finger she dipped it into the barrel. Sliding down the barrel, she leant her back against it and raised the jug to her lips, smacking them soundly though she did not drink. Outwardly at ease but with raging impatience within, she wriggled flat and closed her eyes and waited for their attention to wander away from her presence. Peeking cautiously from beneath the arm slung across her face, she saw the moon drooped low in the sky. She was running out of time. Grunting softly she rolled over onto her side, halfway now between light and shadow. None of the gracht responded to her movement. Rolling again onto her front, she drew up her legs and shifted carefully into a squat. Huddled in the darkness she waited, listening for the slightest sound behind her. Nothing moved. Quietly she slipped back to the rocks. Gwym nodded and smiled, giving her a quick hug as she rejoined him and the other gipsies waiting for her and together they all moved silently back up the pass.</p>\r\n<p>After Davin had been wounded and fallen into a fever from the infection, Rhodka had ordered the wounded (at least, all that could be moved) to be taken up to the plateau. Then he had called Katas and Captains together and they had sat in lengthy discussion about their situation. Neither Dwarf nor Soyex were a docile race. They did not enjoy prolonged inactivity and the waiting defence they had been forced to assume had not come easy to either. So when Eona’s message arrived asking them to attack, it came almost as a sign, to which they readily agreed. Everyone was set immediately to polishing every sizable scrap of metal they could find. Strapping it to the body was preferable, since it left both hands free for fighting, but some were too large except to be carried as a shield. Nothing was wasted. When this was done, the stocky, dwarven ponies were loaded with every available weapon and, on the afternoon before the proposed attack, they set off in small groups and travelled upstream. Bearing in mind that the night shadows were no defence against the goblins'' incredible vision, they travelled until they could no longer see the lights of the enemy camp before lowering themselves and their equipment down the raised bank. They moved and worked with a will and determination happy at last, to be doing something again. Once on the lower bank, they crept stealthily towards the enemy horde, as close as they dared. They settled down to wait. </p>\r\n<p>The sun poked its head over the horizon. Rising unenthusiastically behind a veil of cloud that diffused its brightness into a weak gesture of hazy light. Rhodka watched it with dismayed. It was the one thing none of them had considered, even when they were scrupulously polishing their armour. In the midst of winter such a possibility should have been uppermost in their minds, he reproached himself silently. But it was too late to wonder the ''whys'' and ''wherefores'' now. If they waited any longer they were certain to be spotted. He gave the signal. A horn sounded and the defenders of Rohansuk charged, yelling and shouting, upon the surprised enemy. The two sides clashed in a thunderous roar that rocked that earth and boomed in deafening echoes across the land. Blood flowed like cheap ale in a waterside tavern. Bodies fell like leaves in autumn. Death strode in sombre indifference, careless of name or race &mdash; indiscriminate in her choice of victim. Seeking only numbers.</p>\r\n<p>The battle began in favour of the defenders. Goblin and gracht, dulled in wits and heavy in limb from the sleeping herbs they had unknowingly taken, were slow and disorientated by their condition and the surprise attack. The defenders made good use of their advantage. Cutting mercilessly through the enemy numbers, they forced the enemy back as they hacked with almost reckless abandon, buoyed by the increasing numbers of the enemy falling dead at their feet and the tantalising taste of sweet victory. But as the effects of the drug wore off, the balance began to sway. Speed and strength returned and the goblin-gracht horde surged back with murderous wrath. Fury and hatred dripped from snarling fangs. Bloodlust stared from crimson eyes blind to everything but the desire to kill. Powerful arms ripped limb from limb. Yellow fangs tore flesh from bones, splattering blood in spittle-foamed screams of challenge and threat that drowned all thought and reason, leaving only the basic instinct to survive. Barely conscious of their comrades beside them the defenders battled on. </p>\r\n<p>To hesitate or falter was to die, as the battlefield became a nightmare world of insanity and horror. A red world of excruciating pain, terrifying sounds and nauseating smells. Further and further the defenders were pushed back. Over the bodies of their kinsmen and comrades, passed the fallen enemy and their brief moment of hope, back upon the nights'' stealthy advance. Weak and weary, already beaten in their minds, the defenders slowly gave up the struggle. Word was sent back from the front line for those behind to run, to Talgheer or to anywhere &mdash; just run. On its way, the word was met by rumour and it turned and went back to the front line. And as it went it made a pathway through the disbelieving eyes of the defenders and wiped their weary faces with a cool cloth of hope and wonder.</p>\r\n<p>”With the Mother’s arm and Tacha’s hammer, we shalt forge ourselves a victory yet this day!” </p>\r\n<p>The deep-bellied roar of Palach blew like a gale across their flagging spirits, whipping up their courage and blowing strength into their weakened bodies.</p>\r\n<p>"Seirin! Mêrra nyei ra''uljahpa Soyex, ti jaxra!" </p>\r\n<p>U''min stabbed the murky sky with his curved blade. </p>\r\n<p>Once more the balance of battle shifted, as the clouds parted and the sun revealed its shining glory and its power over darkness. Golden light beamed out from the gleaming metal of U''mins'' sword and from polished armour and struck blinding reflections into the eyes of the enemy. The balance was not tipped entirely back into the favour of the defenders, for not all the enemy were affected: the gracht less so than the goblins and of those, much depended on the lingering effectiveness of Duman’s magic on each affected individual’s threshold to withstand the burning pain, on the brightness of the reflective sheen with which they were confronted and other variables that played for and against either side &mdash; variables that together, achieved a more even balance between the two forces, each fighting for their cause. </p>\r\n<ol type="1">\r\n  <li>The enemy were fighting for Duman &mdash; Father and Master, Loved and Feared. Also fighting for life &mdash; because they were told they must.</li>\r\n  <li>The defenders were fighting for their families, for their land, for their hopes and dreams, for goodness and right, for survival &mdash; because they knew they must.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Can Death be told, reader?</p>\r\n<p>Or does she already know which cause is strong enough to bar her path?</p>\r\n<p>And when her quota is filled... what then shall Death decide?</p>\r\n<p>Death merely smiled and drifted on her course, oblivious to Eona’s screams. The answer had been written in her face but, shrouded beneath the flowing hood, Eona’s glimpse was brief and though she pleaded and cried for a second glance, Death simply faded into the mists of ''Sight'' and was gone. </p>\r\n<p>Eona awoke in Malinka’s arms. She knew immediately there were others present. Gwym, Eiva, Sula, Ador. Most probably staring down at her faces white and creased with worry. She could almost hear their strained smiles stretch thinly with relief as they realised she awake. She wanted to give them reassurance but felt too weak to respond. Weaker even than when her span of life had been drained from her. A sob escaped her. Her body was shaking with the relief of being released from the terrible grip of the final sequence of the vision that had overwhelmed her. Yet she could not shake away the stiffness of fear that held her body and mind like a vice. Malinka’s voice whispered from far away. She heard movement. A cup was pressed against her lips. At first she refused to drink, until the sharp aroma told her it was a restorative and not a sleeping draught. She blinked gratefully at Malinka, thanking her for the drink and her loyalty. She knew the old woman would far rather have given her the sleeping draught but must have sensed her need to talk was greater than her need to rest. The warm liquid slowly soothed the coldness of her tension and Eona began to relax. She closed her eyes, leaning back into the pillows with a sigh as she allowed the herbs to do their work.&nbsp;Malinka refilled her glass and by the time she had finished it, Eona felt ready to talk.</p>\r\n<p>"I won''t... can''t tell you what was revealed to me. Words could not describe, nor would I want you to suffer it. I will only say that I walked within the cloak of Death herself and let that be the guide of your imaginings. Life’s'' web is tangled. The mists of ''Sight'' so thick that even the Powers that Rule are blinded. Only Death, who recognises no boundaries, can traverse them. She alone knows the answer we all seek. She offered it to me but I was unprepared and the glimpse she gave so fleeting, it was gone before I even realised what it was. And though I pleaded and offered everything I possessed, even to my very spirit, she would take none of it. But this I did glean for my efforts... for even Death has her mercy. A single choice will decide."</p>\r\n<p>Her voice began to slip away and she began murmuring low to herself, her drifting thoughts leaking out in subdued tones, as though she had forgotten they were there. The small group glanced at each other anxiously as she appeared to lose herself deeper and deeper in her wanderings. The sun broke through the clouds and shone through the window across where she lay. Her hand lifted slowly to her face. A fleeting smile turned the corners of her mouth. Wistfulness, slanted by the troubled frown that creased her forehead, gave her a lost look. Her eyes narrowed, squinting as though she were searching, seeking something. Then she reached into the sunlight, to grasp the intangible. Gwym gazed questioningly at Malinka but the old woman shook her head. This was no trance. </p>\r\n<p>"Whos'' choice? What choice?" Eona began to whisper again. "Who is left to choose? What choices left to make?"</p>\r\n<p>"There are always choices, grand-daughter," a voice she recognised answered for her ears alone. Eona’s cry fell pitifully into the hushed room of helpless onlookers.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know what to do. Why did you leave me? There is nothing left. How can I say there is nothing left?" she sobbed.</p>\r\n<p>"You must. I tried to shield them all. Carry the burdens alone. I thought I could control the events revealed to me that way. By making their choices for them. I was wrong. That is why I lost them both, because I sent Tielan. I did not allow him to choose his own path. He paid for my arrogance. Don''t make my mistakes granddaughter. We are but the messengers. Let them make their own choices." </p>\r\n<p>"No! Don''t go," Eona reached out at the fading image but grasped only empty air. </p>\r\n<p>Her body slumped forward and Malinka moved aside as Gwym knelt beside the cot, rubbing Eona’s cold hand and calling her name. She lifted her head; white gaze passing with agonizing slowness amongst those perched anxiously on the edges of their seats. Her face was sad but resolved.</p>\r\n<p>"It seems a lifetime ago since Tielan died to save the life of the boy, Jarok. Why was he sacrificed? Oh yes," she answered the surprised gasps from her companions. "The Sharran knew the dangers but she would not take the chance he might refuse. Jarok was no ordinary boy. He was the hope of the world, the one, the only one that could defeat Duman. But something went terribly wrong and Jarok too was lost. How, remains unexplained. Unfathomable. For it should not have been so. Was not written so. Nevertheless, it was so. The burden of hope therefore fell upon the Powerwielder. To do what she could and hope it would be enough. She... " Eona faltered and closed her eyes. </p>\r\n<p>Her companions were filled with dread at the sudden whiteness of her pallor. Desiring yet dreading the confirmation of their suspicions for it. None spoke. Staring in silent trepidation at the tears slipping down Eonas cheeks. </p>\r\n<p>"Symtar has fallen. The last of the defenders have fled and the city burns. The Fellisan army is lost almost to the man. Half the Elven Elite and two-thirds of the Knights and men of Rohansuk are also dead. The rest have fled to the mountains in the north. They continue the fight but their numbers are dwindling, as are the places to hide. But worse is this. The Powerwielder has been taken. Already she is in Ak''thai. All is lost!" </p>\r\n<p>If silence is in death, then the Sharran’s caravan was a grave &mdash; hollow, silent, cold with numb emotions and bated breath.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 26, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

(50, 'The colour of Power', 'CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE', '<div align="justify"><br><br>\r\n<img align="left" vspace="0" hspace="0" alt="H" src="H.gif">igh on the rocky towers of Ak''thai, the gargoyle head turned slowly. Red eyes followed the slim figure of Alyse as she stepped, without hesitation, onto the causeway and walked unafraid, across the open ground and up to the massive doors of the fortress... pausing only to glance left and right at the Dragon guards rearing protectively either side of the steps. Her hand banged once and the doors swung silently inwards. Immediately she stepped inside, the Shadow felt the strong pull of Duman’s summons and was guided through the great labyrinth, to the head of the corridor that led down to the Casting Room. Duman sensed the power drawing closer and prepared himself to meet his destiny.<p></p>\r\n<p>However, when Alyse arrived and came to halt by his side, Duman was so overcome by a sudden rush of excitement that he could do no more than cast a suspension spell, to hold girl and Shadow fast, while he sat on the top step to catch his rapid breaths and slow his racing heart and mind. After a time he got up and walked slowly around Alyse’s frozen figure. He lifted her pale, amber hair. Drawing his fingers through its silkiness and letting his hand fall to stroke the softness of her cheek. Taking her hands in his he turned them over, tracing the lines of her palms with delicate strokes of his thumbnails. They were not childish hands he noted, but rough and hard-working yet at the same time, sensitive and gentle. Letting them fall slowly back to her sides, he stepped back a pace and gazed into her clear, blue eyes. On the surface they were empty but delving deeper he could just make out the banked fires of the Dragon’s power simmering fiercely. A slow smile of intense satisfaction twisted his mouth. His eyes became glowing pools of avaricious lust for possession that brought a red flush to his high cheekbones. Then he was laughing ecstatically, clapping his hands and skipping with light abandon about the object of his desire, like a small child on the morning of his birthday confronted with the very present he had yearned for.</p>\r\n<p>From deep within, Alyse stared back down the long tunnel of the Shadows'' vision with revulsion and shuddered at the madness that danced, hand in hand, with the dark evil that lurked within the cavorting mage. She reinforced her barriers, not an easy task within the confines of the psychic prison that pressed in upon her, so that the wizard would not see the fear that threatened to engulf her. But though it shielded her from Duman’s gaze, it did not hide from her the sight of his loathsome leer or the closeness of his face to hers'' as he took her cheeks in his hands to peer ever deeper into her eyes. Her only consolation was that her senses were numb to her and she did not have to bear the feel of his touch or the smell of his breath that stirred her hair. Across the muffled distance she heard his pawing voice.</p>\r\n<p>"I can smell the power within you, woman-child," he whispered as he inhaled deeply. "But do not concern yourself. Soon you will be rid of your burden. As for you... " he leaned back, taking her hands and lifting them out to her sides as he swung her further into the pale light from the sconce. "You really are quite delightful, in a common sort of way. No offence, but beauty has never been one of the virtues of Man. Yet there is something about you, I find strangely pleasing... perhaps I will keep you too. But first we must get you somewhere safe. Away from temptations that might prove, shall we say... uncomfortable... to your state of health?"</p>\r\n<p>He let go of her hands, released the suspension spell and sprinkled a pouch of powder over Alyse’s head. A mixture prepared from blood, skin, hair and nail and dried in black flame. Then, using the psychic bond that existed between himself and the Shadow that inhabited her body, he threw a mystic cloak about her so that they became one entity (as far as the senses of the wards were concerned) and led her down to the runic safeguard on the first landing.</p>\r\n<p>For a few worrying moments he felt his heart and mind burn as the magic’s reacted suspiciously to the thick cloud of excitement that masked his thoughts. He turned his mind to the great glaciers of Jhai Nahv and the blue icebergs that rode the icy seas and once his mind had cooled, thrust his psyche outwards to rise dominantly over the dark questioners and force them to yield. But the safeguard was not merely a token ward. It was strong and dangerous. Well cast and not easily overcome and the effort of doing so sapped his energies, so that he stumbled down the remaining flight of stairs and fell through the door onto the stones, where he sucked greedily at the residual energies that ever lingered there in a carpet of green mist.</p>\r\n<p>The Shadow held Alyse in the doorway and she watched with macabre fascination as Duman’s gaunt and grey features filled out and their healthy colour returned. She watched him rise and tread softly towards her, his beckoning arm waving her inside as the door swung quietly closed behind her. He led her into a large pentagram set out with marked rune-stones, each one different to the next, and with a single black candle at the fore. He positioned her carefully in front of the candle before lifting his robe and stepping backwards out of the pentagram. Muttered words fell low and fast from his lips as his fingers spread the air. All about Alyse, the green energies of a force field sparked to life. She could sense the rising anger of the one that possessed her. Feel it straining to be free. With a click of Duman’s fingers, the candle flared and as the flame grew, Alyse saw her own shadow stretch out from her feet and rise up the side of the force field. It grew darker, denser than any normal shadow she had ever seen and then, with a feeling akin to pulling a splinter from beneath the flesh, she felt Duman’s Shadow draw itself free, to stand in ghostly, black imitation of the wizard beyond the field. Pain tingled everywhere as her own senses rushed to fill the void its departure had created. Then the burning sensitivity was forgotten in the sudden swell of a flashing memory. It was of Yushok, a burning brand in his hand lowered close toward her and the mare. She remembered the anguish in his eyes and that she had thought at the time, that it was for the mare. She gasped as she saw clearly now that it had not been grief... but guilt she had read there! What the A''mathan had done had been a deliberate act, but why? How could he have known?</p>\r\n<p>Fierce, excruciating agony ripped through her mind and she crumpled to the floor, clasping her head tightly, as that part of her that was Ecos tore the thoughts away from her grasp and thrust them deep, deeper into the living heart of the Power where, hopefully, Duman would not find them.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps I should have warned you about that,” laughed Duman, misconstruing the reasons for her reaction. "The Shadows'' presence drains the life-force of its host. Had you not been in possession of the power, you would now be dead. So really, it''s not too bad a trade, is it? A little pain for your life?" A querying eyebrow lifted in her direction.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse lifted her head from the floor and glared at him with all the hatred her eyes could muster. Unimpressed, he merely laughed the louder. Next to Alyse, the Shadow had grown tired of the wizard’s games and of waiting for its promised reward. It pressed upon the force field, causing it to spark and crackle, stabbing the fleshless form with bolts of green fire. A silent groan of rage and pain spurted from the gaping hole within its featureless face, manifesting itself in twisted gyrations of its insubstantial greyness.</p>\r\n<p>"Patience! Patience,” scolded Duman with gentle, friendly tones as he stepped closer.</p>\r\n<p>To Alyse, the sickly-sweet insincerity was so thick as to be spreadable but the Shadow seemed unaware and relaxed beneath Duman’s generous smile.</p>\r\n<p>"I''ve not forgotten you," he pointed to what looked like a square, wooden tray that had appeared behind the Shadow. "Go and stand on the plate there."</p>\r\n<p>The Shadow turned its head slowly to the plate then back to Duman &mdash; its fluctuating colour evidence of its suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t lower the force field or she will escape. The plate will transport you out. Trust me," he purred, as the Shadow continued to hesitate. "We are of the same, are we not?"</p>\r\n<p>This affirmation of kinship seemed to placate the Shadows'' suspicions and it stepped obediently onto the plate. In the blink of an eye, it was all over. Duman’s hand had slashed downwards and from nowhere an upturned box had dropped down over the Shadows'' form, squashing it between box and lid until the two met. Four clasps instantly locked into place. The box vanished and reappeared, reduced in size, upon Duman’s open palm. The incredible speed had left the Shadow with no chance to react and all it could do now was beat violently against its prison... much to Duman’s amusement. He tapped the lid just once, warning it to be still, then curled his fingers protectively about the box and strode to the table lined up against the far wall. There, he opened a small, domed casket and placed the smaller box inside.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m really quite disappointed in you," his mocking tone drifted easily across the room. "Surely there''s enough of me in you, for you to have realised that there was really no way I could allow you to roam free?" He put the casket to his ear. "No? Oh well, you''ll have plenty of time to figure it out."</p>\r\n<p>His inane laughter snapped off with the snapping shut of the casket lid. He picked up a tiny lock and slid it through the closed clasp and locked it, secreting the even tinier key into one of the many folds in his robe. He blew upon the lock and the keyhole disappeared. Quiet murmurings preceded him to the centre of the room, where one of the flagstones scraped aside. As Duman waved his hand over the casket, it rose up from his palm and lowered itself gently into the space provided. Very slowly, the flagstone crept back into place. Fire flashed down from Duman’s fingertips, searing the stone with a complicated rune. Afterwards he stood, head bowed, staring down at the smouldering mark like a graveside mourner before briskly dusting his palms together and spinning around to face Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"All things considered, I think that went rather well. Shall we get on?"</p>\r\n<p>His cold, matter-of-factness chilled Alyse to the core and she dropped her gaze, putting all her concentration into finding a more comfortable position in which to sit, for she dared not try to stand knowing her trembling legs and weak knees would give her away instantly. The fear she had thought she had felt all those other times, when the inevitability of this moment had weighed down on her, was little more than anxiety she now realised as sheer terror clawed deep gouges in her heart and spirit. She leaned heavily into the Dragon, warming to the strength and wisdom that soothed and encouraged her. Duman was talking again but she was not listening. Her mind was tuned inwards as Ecos gave her the benefit of his experience.</p>\r\n<p>''Thou must rise. Duman abhors weakness and wilt enjoy exploiting even the smallest amount that thou revealest. Up until now, thou hast piqued his interest and perhaps, even gained a measure of respect. But if thine courage falters, he wilt make thee suffer.”</p>\r\n<p>“I am already suffering. All is lost. Jarok. Cymon. And Yushok... Yushok betrayed me... us. He whom you told me to trust above all others... It is over. I might as well just lay here and let him get on with it.''''</p>\r\n<p>“In truth, Yushok’s act doth mystify me also, but betray... never. That is why thou must not</p>\r\n<p>bring these thoughts to the surface. Duman wilt find them soon enough but thou must allow the A''mathan time to employ his plan... for surely he must hath one to perform such a deed. As for everything else... dwell not on what thou hast lost, but on what thou hast.”</p>\r\n<p>“And what do we have?” </p>\r\n<p>“Life! Where there is life... there is hope.” </p>\r\n<p>“I fail to find anything hopeful in our present situation.” </p>\r\n<p>“Clear thy mind and think. Duman hath said... thou wilt be rid of thy burden. He knoweth not that we are One. In this we must surely hath an advantage. We needs must employ it.” </p>\r\n<p>“But how?” </p>\r\n<p>“Remember in the Mornay... when thou didst separate thyself from me?” </p>\r\n<p>“I''ve been trying to forget!” </p>\r\n<p>“Twas not a good thing. But if we couldst control it. Divide... “</p>\r\n<p>“... personalities. I see what you mean! One with yours'' dominant... one with mine..”</p>\r\n<p>“... we wouldst still be One... “ </p>\r\n<p>“... but separate. It is possible. It may give us the edge if an opportunity arises and it not... “ </p>\r\n<p>“... then shouldst any harm come thee... “ </p>\r\n<p>“... then he still loses.” </p>\r\n<p>The silent conversation had lasted only a matter of heartbeats and with another, Alyse had weaved a veil across the astral plane and transferred her personality to the other side, keeping her link to Ecos by only the slenderest of threads. She felt light-headed and faint, lost and alone. Fighting down her panic, she reached out along the thread and found Ecos'' reassuring presence and a strange comfort in the knowledge that the Dragon shared her anxiousness at being cut adrift.</p>\r\n<p>As yet unprivileged as to the workings of her mind, Duman watched silently from the outside, at first she had lain so still and pale, he had feared her dead. Then his long nails drummed thoughtfully against his thigh and his eyes narrowed into suspicious slits as hers flickered behind closed lids, as though she dreamed restlessly. A sob of laughter escaped her lips and pain etched deeply in suddenly taut features before she relaxed and smiled. His arm whipped upwards and Alyse suddenly found herself standing upright and staring into the wizard’s probing gaze.</p>\r\n<p>"So, tell me old friend. What hopeless plots are you attempting to hatch? They are hopeless. Your power is nothing in my domain unless wielded by me. For all this, is the child of my hand and will aid you nothing... your brothers will attest to that. Feebly they try to rebel against me but in the end, I always win &mdash; just as I have won against you. Here you are, locked behind the forces of my spell. Helpless." He paused and rolled his eyes. "It''s a shame your body is already stone, we could have had so much fun! Did you know I have discovered a means to peel off Dragon scales, one by one? A slow, painful process... at least Felnath thought so. Yes, it would have been good to spend some time together again," his mouth twisted madly.</p>\r\n<p>"You are despicable,” exclaimed Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you, I try my best," Duman replied with a mocking grin. "But I wasn''t talking to you. Well Ecos? Why so quiet? I recall you always had an opinion in the old days. Have the centuries made you soft that you hide behind this child?" </p>\r\n<p>"I am not a child,” snapped Alyse, fists on hips.</p>\r\n<p>"Silence,” bellowed Duman. "Another sound from you and I''ll rip out your tongue and feed it back to you in fine strips!"</p>\r\n<p>"You are going to kill me anyway, so go on... do it,” she screamed back defiantly.</p>\r\n<p>Duman pointed at her face and murmured softly. Alyse felt her mouth being prised open by some invisible force. She tried clenching her teeth but Duman was stronger and her jaw ached as it stretched wider and wider. Suddenly her head was thrown back and inner lids slid aside to reveal the molten, amber fire that signified the persona of the Dragon. Instantly the spell was cut off.</p>\r\n<p>"The levels to which thou wilt stoop hath no boundaries, K''åiel. Why doth thou seek to harm this child? Couldst be that it is thee that hath become soft? Is thy magic not enough to draw me from her? Dost thou need her cooperation? Such mastery is this, that it doth rely upon the whim of a child,” laughed Ecos. "Thou art not worthy of mine words or mine presence. I do not hide, I simply hath no desire to sully mine self with thy company. The child is correct, thou wilt kill her anyway. So be it. Her life shalt be yet one more added to the stains upon thine spirit... for which thou wilt pay dearly. Now trouble me no more. I tire of thine inanity."</p>\r\n<p>Duman’s nostrils flared and an angry flush stained his cheeks. A tirade of curses sprang to his tongue but failed to fall, for the inner lids had already closed and Alyse’s blue eyes stared vacantly back at him until she blinked and gazed about confusedly, as though she had no idea of what had just occurred. Duman swung away, his robe swishing wildly over the flagstones as he flounced back to the table. His agitated murmurings hummed in the otherwise silent room and Alyse smiled with satisfaction when he banged his fist down on the surface, causing the contents of the table to rattle and shake violently. Calling his boiling emotions to order, Duman raised his arms, locking his fingers together as he stretched them over his head until the bones cracked.</p>\r\n<p>"Are you going to get to the point soon?" Alyse called out as Duman rolled the tension from his neck. "Or is it your intention to bore me to death?"</p>\r\n<p>Beneath her bravado, Alyse’s knees wobbled alarmingly as Duman’s head swivelled on his neck until it rested almost back to front on his shoulders. His cold gaze raked her from the distortion of the pulled and wrinkled skin of his mottled face. Fixing a bland expression on her own, Alyse began to straighten her rumpled clothes and tousled hair, forcing herself to ignore his fearsome features in the hope he would return to his work. But when she did look up he was still staring at her and so, summoning all her courage, she raised a delicate eyebrow with an air of haughty disdain.</p>\r\n<p>"Your spirit is most amusing, though more verbal than practise, I warrant. Was it not your intention to ''kill yourself first'' rather than wait upon my pleasure? I''ve seen little evidence of the fierce determination with which you imparted those words to me not long since. But perhaps it is through lack of means?" He snapped his fingers and a dagger appeared in her hand. Startled, she dropped it and it clattered noisily to the floor. Her face reddened at the derisive slant of his brow and the sneer that pulled his lips up the side of his nose.</p>\r\n<p>"Too messy? Perhaps you''re right. Then a rope perhaps... or an easy, painless poison to carry you sleepily into Oblivion?"</p>\r\n<p>Cringing with embarrassment under his drawling challenge, Alyse could only drop her gaze to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"Well then, since you appear to have nothing more amusing to contribute, I suggest you refrain from pestering me further. And just to be certain you fully understand my meaning... Oqvac zedouii-baligar!" </p>\r\n<p>Alyse’s eyes widened as her jaw suddenly clamped shut and refused to move no matter how hard she tried.</p>\r\n<p>"That''s better," nodded Duman, and slowly twisted his neck back into shape. A loud click from his fingers bounced off the walls and dagger, rope and poison vanished and were replaced by a three-legged table. In a shallow dip carved out of the surface rested a clear, crystal Orb. Curious, she reached out but the Orb repelled her touch, forcing her hand to slide off on a cushion of air and initiating a loud hum that vibrated painfully in her ears.</p>\r\n<p>"You''ll get used to it... eventually,” jibed Duman.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse glared mutely at his back.</p>\r\n<p>Duman unlocked the seal on his book of spells. Deep in concentration, his flying fingers lifted the pages to the appropriate place. Closing his eyes and ridding his mind of the remnants of clutter, he began his incantation. His lips moving ceaselessly as he dropped the various components into a deep mortar &mdash; a pinch of this and a spoonful of that, powder, grain and liquid, a handful of grated reed-root, three strands of the victim’s hair, seven drops of slime and last but not least, a small piece of Dragon scale. When the mortar was full, he began to pound the ingredients together, his chants rising and falling with the pestle and stirring the green mists about his ankles so that they swirled about the hem of his robe like grasping fingers. The air pulsed with the growing energies of his casting. It throbbed in the stones and fixtures of the room. The candle flame danced wildly, leaping and licking at the flashing sparks generated by the living forces of dark matter that Duman’s casting was unleashing. When the mixture was sufficiently pulverized into a thick, brown paste, Duman placed the mortar carefully to one side and picked up the Ukkas stem.</p>\r\n<p>"Xytre ibren rek... xirrek zy zocca drekkozii ivizlic!"</p>\r\n<p>Five times he repeated the chant &mdash; one for each turn of the stem. When this was done, he took a thin-bladed knife and sliced the stem lengthwise. Taking one half, he chopped it into fine pieces and sprinkled it into the paste. The mixture started to bubble. Popping with an odorous, yellowish gas that rose up and poured down over the sides of the mortar, swirling sinuously around Duman’s body as he carried the mortar to the pentagram and placed it on the floor. He closed his eyes and raised his arms high and wide. Concentration swelled the veins in his face and neck. Dark shadows appeared beneath his eyes, lakes of black strain filled by the rivers of deep, vertical lines scored down his forehead. Energies sparkled and flashed in the gloomy light like diamond dust, attracted by the drawing influence of the magical forces rising within him and enveloping him in an aura of crackling power.</p>\r\n<p>"Vutterei nagu zi liscaakcai!" </p>\r\n<p>Frost glittered on stone as the temperature began to drop. Alyse sensed the air charging with the subtle fluctuations in the dimensional cortex. The Orb picked up the resonant thrumming of the disturbances and a bright glow pulsed out from within, warming and welcoming the sombre darkness. All about her, pocket-sized tears blinked in and out, revealing tantalizing glimpses of other worlds and other times. Reality became distorted. Warped and twisted images that did not match and sounds that screeched discordantly down illegal passageways. The powdered markings of the pentagram liquefied, candescent brightness quickly overpowered by the sinister light of pure blackness. Luminescent runes sprang to life in the air in obedience to Duman’s summons. He strung each one together, combining their abilities and attributes, bending and subjugating the whole to his will, demanding and controlling their power and unleashing it with wild gesticulations of graceful fingers.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse threw all her strength into her barriers as winds howled and shrieked through the abused corridors of the astral planes. From faraway, she caught the faint strain of evil laughter followed by cries of outrage and sitting behind this, a grey indifference of murmured waiting and refusal of interference, which provoked more of the same. She tried to call out to the Powers that Ruled but either they did not hear or chose to ignore her... maybe a bit of both... and then all sound was drowned out by Duman’s voice nearby.</p>\r\n<p>"Qitra Jæ''ibucis!" </p>\r\n<p>An invisible cord tugged at Alyse’s waist and she was pulled upwards, dangling with arched back and her feet not quite touching the Orb beneath her. She twisted her head and was just able to see Duman out of the corner of her eye. A bright gleam lit his flushed cheeks but she was uncertain as to whether this was exaltation or exhaustion. Whatever he was doing it was certainly draining him, for his hair had turned snow-white and the weariness of age, parched and wrinkled his flesh. But despite this, he stood straight and firm and there was no evidence of weakness in the powerful voice that rang out... loud and clear and steeped with authority.</p>\r\n<p>"Ithkar! Draacun!" </p>\r\n<p>The mortar rose before him. Duman dipped his fingers into the brown paste and then spat, first into his left palm and then his right. The rune and symbol he had summoned appeared accordingly. He pressed his palms together and felt the magic merge with the command and lift from his flesh. When he removed his hands, the empowered Dragon symbol remained burning in the air. His head tilted to one side as he carefully wrapped his will about the symbol and thrust it through the force field.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse felt it coming even though she could not see it. Convulsions gripped her as the black magic struck her breast. Her body jerked and twitched, while in her psyche, burning flame seared the safety of her barriers. She readied herself as she felt them fall but the magic passed her by. </p>\r\n<p>From behind the dividing veil came flickering images, flooding sensations of memories and emotions &mdash; centuries-old memories that Ecos had received from the brothers at their time of betrayal and triggered now, by the repetition of events.</p>\r\n<p>Eagerness. Excitement. Longing. Confusion. Realisation. Dismay. Regret. Anger &mdash; overwhelming, intense anger.</p>\r\n<p>The jumbled torrent sent her spinning, leaving her own thoughts lost in the fog of increasing hatred and disgust with which she readily reciprocated. Knowing she was in great danger of losing her way, she strained to hold on to her own clarity, to resist the temptation to flow back into the Oneness that gave her strength and comfort. So it was with relief as well as horror, that she felt her body arch again.</p>\r\n<p>"Tekoi! K''yimath Xu!" </p>\r\n<p>Again Duman dipped his fingers and spat into his palms and sent the magic hurtling towards her. And again, pain ripped into her as the servant of evil invaded the plane of her being, obliterating the last, shredded remnants of her barriers. A cold numbness swept over her body, draining the perception of her senses and leaving it no more than a dead weight that anchored her to reality. But her psyche was not so lucky. Red-hot needles pierced her. Her screams filled the astral plane and were lifted by the deep roar of Ecos, as she plummeted into the murky depths of agony towards the rising limbo of insanity. She clawed her way desperately through the haze seeking escape but before she could find it, a form began to materialize before her. A circle. The symbol of the Mother!</p>\r\n<p>Instinctively the Power sought to move closer but with all her will she constrained it. Other circles appeared within it. And as the whole stabilized and became clearer, the black fire was revealed &mdash; the dark force that tarnished and corroded the symbol’s goodness, making a mockery of its true nature. She tried to pull away but the seal spread itself upon her, staking its claim like a slave’s collar and freezing her will beneath Duman’s magical mastery. Her violent thrashing brought only the rumbling of taunting laughter and so she ceased to resist, refusing to be a receptacle for their amusement. Her calm docility quite plainly aggravated the dark magic, she realised with satisfaction, and deemed the subsequent pain they inflicted, as they determined to stamp their authority more forcefully, well worth it. But as they pulled torturously at the fragile thread that linked her with Ecos, tightening and fraying it until it was almost at breaking point, she grew increasingly alarmed, knowing that if it snapped it would mean certain death for her and the end for him. Should they return to their single state? </p>\r\n<p>Was it even possible now, she thought anxiously, given the magical hold on them both? She started to lean along the thread that vibrated soothingly.</p>\r\n<p>''Hold'' </p>\r\n<p>She picked up the thought and secreted it away quickly, yet not quickly enough, for she sensed a change in the force that bound her. Suspicion rippled through it and was followed by shafts of searing agony. Strong and insistent, she was uncertain as to how long she could withstand the pressure. Unwittingly, Duman came to her rescue.</p>\r\n<p>"Kyidra-vii!" </p>\r\n<p>The interlocking command brought a reversal of fortunes, as the two personalities were forced together. Not as they were, into a single entity, but with enough overlap to bring a greater reassurance of completeness. Though it was more pleasing to be so, each identity put up a token struggle (just in case) since they could not know exactly how much of what was happening Duman was actually aware of. When it was done, Alyse bathed in the comfort of semi-reunion and the cessation of pain. The magic that inhabited the symbols was far from happy however. They rebelled at the idea of losing their individual identities and fought vehemently against the control of Duman’s will. Energy rose and the black fire flared, punishing their disobedience and extracting excruciating recompense in their inevitable failure. As they writhed beneath the malignant cruelty, half of each melted away and Duman slammed the remaining pieces together with such force, the tremors rattled in lingering waves and crested upon the hapless magic with frothing agony that far exceeded anything she had been subjected to.</p>\r\n<p>"Pryxiis... Morvac... Ebris! Zyri Kyidra-vii-zetriv! Zertiz-vii. Kyidra xepidi... Kyidra pryxiis... Vii morvac! Ebris Kyidra... math... acun. Xesiis... KYIDRA-VII!" </p>\r\n<p>Duman’s voice rose and fell as the ancient Huri tongue spelt out the final incantation. His arms spread wide and flung forward to direct the unleashed forces. The last of the brown paste exploded in a stinking cloud as screaming winds scoured the room, whipping at his robe and buffeting his body. Bracing himself against it, he stood his ground, forcing the opening he sought and the compliance of the power he summoned. Suddenly, all fell still, a mystical hush descending upon both physical and psychic worlds. A bated breath bringing momentary respite in which Alyse pondered what was to befall her, just as the eye of the storm brings false peace before the fury resumes.</p>\r\n<p>The first, and only sign, that Alyse received was a buzz of excitement vibrating through the Power within her as beneath her feet, the light within the Orb grew pale. The warm glow fading to pastel softness until the last tones of yellow yielded, through creamy white to white and whiter, to go beyond even the purest whiteness and pass to the moment in time when it is neither white or black, nor any shade there between... but is that perfection of colour that has no name... for none can name that true absence of colour for which... ''white''... is but a poor and feeble impostor.</p>\r\n<p>This then... this purity of true absence...&nbsp;is the colour of Power!</p>\r\n<p>Only those that have or wield the Power can comprehend its beauty and hue, for it is perceived, not with the physical eye or even the psychic, but with the eye of Power alone. And when it is passed, its majesty is swiftly forgotten, for the mortal mind cannot hold its wonder.</p>\r\n<p>Such light as this, nothing can mar. </p>\r\n<p>No surface can reflect. </p>\r\n<p>No barriers can contain. </p>\r\n<p>All yield to its perfection. And in all these things and more, it is strong. Supreme. </p>\r\n<p>And yet it remains the weakest of things. For it has no self and thus, is at the mercy of the wielder. Be that wielder good or evil. </p>\r\n<p>And at this moment, the wielder was Duman, mage and servant of darkness. And upon his bidding it rose from the depths of the Orb and draped itself like a silken sheet about Alyse.</p>\r\n<p>Softly it enwrapped her. Covering her. Shielding her. Infusing her. Reforming her. </p>\r\n<p>So that flesh and psyche ceased to exist and she felt nothing... sensed nothing... thought nothing, was... nothing &mdash; nothing but the pure essence of existence.</p>\r\n<p>The warm blood in her veins, pulsing to the rhythmic beat of her heart, told her that she was still alive. She ran her hands along her arms and stomach. Her body was back. She probed inwards. Her psyche was once more her own, all trace of the dark taint of sorcery gone. She looked about her. The sparking green force field was also gone and the stone flags of the floor &mdash; the whole room, all gone. Where was she? Inside the Orb, she realised. But where exactly was that? </p>\r\n<p>Another dimension? She reached out carefully. No. The senses were necessarily faint, since she did not want to alert Duman of her action, but they were of her own reality. She gave thanks for that. The dimensional doors Duman had been opening must only have been to access magic strong enough for what he was doing. At least now she knew how the sorcery had been achieved... for all the good it did her!</p>\r\n<p>She sighed deeply and looked around her once again. It was an empty place. Not cold but sterile. Without form or colour, except for herself. Walking, she found, got her nowhere. So she tried to will herself to the boundary. That too, proved a useless exercise, for every time she thought she had made it and stopped, she was back in the centre again. Eventually she gave up and sat down to think.</p>\r\n<p>Now she was still, she sensed a growing anxiety within her. Ecos was faring badly. It surprised her at first, since it had always been the other around and was herself that found everything overwhelming and who floundered under the pressure. She leaned into his great mind to offer comfort and support and discovered him on the verge of panic. Forgetting all about their previous plan she merged wholly, relieved at the flow of calm that resulted in their Oneness. It felt strange to have him bathe in the finite confines of her mortal mind and even more that he should gain strength from it. That with all his knowledge and wisdom, his timeless age, his immortality and infinite mind that knew no bounds Ecos was afraid. </p>\r\n<p>And it suddenly became clear that it was these very attributes that accounted for his unprecedented weakness. For a limitless consciousness such as his, to suddenly find itself constrained behind barriers was agonizing, frightening, maddening. How much more then, she thought with pity, had the brothers suffered without the companionship of one born and accustomed to the finite? She reached out to see if she could sense them. She could not hear them but she could feel their emotions as they responded to her touch. </p>\r\n<p>Warmth came to her... and Joy. Elation. Bemusement. Frustration. Interminable agony.</p>\r\n<p>This last she knew, was Felnath, and she sent him love and reassurance with all her strength. </p>\r\n<p>"He hath indeed suffered much and shames me that I shouldst crumble so swiftly," said Ecos, full of self-disgust, especially when he remembered his scathing rebuke of the young Dragon.</p>\r\n<p>"I expect they all went through the same at first," Alyse answered somewhat absently, busy trying to pin down a thought that was straying with aggravating elusiveness on the periphery of her mind. "There is definitely something wrong here. When we... you," she corrected, since Ecos had done so alone and of his own accord, "contacted them before, they were somewhere else."</p>\r\n<p>"True. Duman hath another Orb, which he doth use to summon mine brothers to do his bidding. ''Tis in this one that they communicate with each other. They canst not do so otherwise."</p>\r\n<p>"Then how was I able to do so?"</p>\r\n<p>"Mayhap he hath set a trap for us?" </p>\r\n<p>"I do not believe so, or else he would have summoned us by now. His whole being was focused into getting me here, and his strength. I doubt he had any left over for extras. No. This is something else. Something even he had not reckoned on."</p>\r\n<p>"Magic is anathema to me. I canst not delve even into the periphery of it. Though we art One, thou art still mortal and, if thou art willing to distance thine self from me as completely as in the Mornay, thou shouldst be able to attempt an understanding of it through imaging."</p>\r\n<p>"I do not know?" she murmured doubtfully. "We have been One for much longer now and even the thread was wrenching. I am not sure... "</p>\r\n<p>"We canst survive apart for a short time. Thou now hast residue Power of thine own in thine veins, enough to sustain thee for the task."</p>\r\n<p>"But what if I... I mean, it was only by sheer luck last time... "</p>\r\n<p>"Last time thine psyche wast vulnerable and I couldst not interfere. This time I shalt call and rejoin thee if thou canst not find thy way back."</p>\r\n<p>Alyse was far from happy. But she was sure there was something to find that would be to their benefit. Taking a deep breath (though whether she was actually breathing she did not know), she drew all herself that she knew was Alyse into a tight globe and then slammed up her barriers. A dread feeling of emptiness swamped her. A terrible silence deafened her. Loneliness so profound her spirit cried out in despair.</p>\r\n<p>''Focus. He is still there,'' she assured her abused psyche. ''Focus and let us see the foulness that has dared touch us.''</p>\r\n<p>An image appeared. It was herself. Next to it was the image of a tree, to represent Duman’s spell, since she knew more about plants than anything else. The tree was in full bloom &mdash; leaves dark and heavy, black flowers sharing branches with ripe, round fruits. It appeared strong and healthy. She stepped closer and large thorns sprouted from trunk and branch, each tipped with a glistening droplet of poison. Filled with disappointment, she decided she must have been mistaken. Then a bright, red spot appeared on one of the lower branches. More appeared, spreading over the glossy surface of a discolouring leaf that was slowly curling, tighter and tighter, wrinkling and shrivelling and finally breaking loose to flutter softly to her feet. She bent down to the roots. No thorns barred her way. With delicate precision of force, to test but not disturb, she touched one. To her great delight, it was soft and spongy and moving her face closer, she could just smell the bitter tang of disease starting to drift from it. Having found out what she wanted to know she dismissed both images and dropped her barriers, falling into the welcoming awareness of Ecos in joyous relief. The information she brought was shared instantly but they took a few moments to rejoice and repair their bruised essence before discussing it. </p>\r\n<p>"It would seem that Duman’s impatience has led him to be careless," said Alyse. "He has used diseased components to mix his spell."</p>\r\n<p>"Thou art certain of this?"</p>\r\n<p>"That is what the symbolism would suggest." Her emotions soared as she voiced the implications of this. "The sorcery that binds us is collapsing. If it accelerates quickly enough and our timing is perfect, we may defeat him yet,” she cried and was doused by the wise waters of caution from the deep, calming depths of Ecos.</p>\r\n<p>Alyse had been correct in saying that Duman had not set a trap but she had also been very, very lucky. Had the wizard not been so extraordinarily drained by the casting, he would not have transferred the Orb so quickly to its secret room and where (again Lady Luck smiled upon Alyse) he had yet to place a guard. Had he done so, he would have been alerted to the discolouration upon the Orb’s surface and investigated. But as it was, he was driven to the Life fire and was lost in exuberant release as its balming gifts restored his stamina and strength, returned the jet to his whitened hair, inflated his shrunken chest replaced the moisture to his wizened flesh and the flush of youth to his grey cheeks. </p>\r\n<p>As he imbibed of their precious gifts, Duman mulled in his mind the increasing frequency with which he found himself drawn here. He knew his skill and knowledge made easier work of his castings and yet this one had taken more from him than when he had entrapped all four Dragons together at a time when he was young and inexperienced in his Art. There was more to this than the mere passing of age draining his vitality. And as he stood there (much longer than was usual) reviewing the facts he knew, he came to the conclusion that the Black Ones were trying to prevent him from accomplishing his destiny by deliberately interfering with his life-force, perhaps through his own rune? Extracting power from it to drain him.</p>\r\n<p>Stepping from the Life fire, he knew he could not now risk an immediate conclusion to his plans. First he must research how the Black Ones were affecting him and find a means to block them. He dared not chance beginning such an enormous undertaking as the Absorption spell, with this threat unresolved. If he should weaken as quickly as he just had, he could not guarantee success... and he was not about fail now.</p>\r\n<p>"I defy you,” he screamed, spittle hissing into the black fire. "D''you hear me? I defy you! And when it is mine, I shall crush you all and blow your dust down the corridors of Oblivion!"</p>\r\n<p>Fiery energy flashed from his fingers as his frustration turned to fury and sparked with the madness that gleamed, ever-present now, in his eyes. And then he was laughing. Insane, high-pitched laughter echoing around the room, stirring the flames of the Life fire and straining the stability of the dimensional gateway, as his will slipped through the waning control of his melting mind. The screeching discord brought Duman back to his senses and he returned the Life fire to its own dimension and sealed the gate. A flick of his wrist took him to his tower room where he spent a long while pacing angrily, back and forth, before sitting at his desk with his head resting on his arm and muttering into the sleeve of his robe.</p>\r\n<p>Books and scrolls appeared before him were read and re-read, searched and probed.</p>\r\n<p>Torn or thrown. Dismissed or returned, as he sought the answer to his problem. At last, he found it. He knew it when the hair bristled on the back of his neck and his hand shook so much, the quill slipped from his fingers. He picked it up and settled into configuring a counter-spell. Happy in his ignorance of the true problem, he had no doubts about his ability to construct one.</p>\r\n<p>Far below the wizard’s feet, Kretos sat, miserable and alone, in the dim solitude of one of the less frequented tunnels. He had stayed well clear of the main fortress since returning with the diseased Ukkas and had waited with trepidation, mingled with excited longing, for the outcome of his daring. Relief had held hands with disappointment when Duman had failed to come for him. Relief, because it seemed fairly safe to assume his deceit had gone undetected... he was still alive. The down side however, was that so too, was Duman. The diseased stem appeared to have had little consequence after all, for all reports suggested that Duman was well pleased with his days'' work. And it got worse. As Kretos was digesting the failure of his plan and trying to gather together the pieces of his shattered hopes, the final blow fell with the news that the object of Duman’s casting had been none other than the Lady herself! The one he had believed would be the saviour of them all. All at once, the future became a cold and dismal thing that he could no longer visualize as having any place or importance in his life.</p>\r\n<p>All his strength was gone. Run off, hand in hand, with his hopes and dreams. </p>\r\n<p>He was tired. Tired of trying, scheming, playing games. Physically weary and mentally exhausted, he could see no point in going on. In the dark listlessness of his depleted will, he decided there was only one more thing left for him to do. He would tell his family to leave this place and then end this torturous charade once and for all. There must be something in this place of death that would give him the blessed relief he craved. </p>\r\n<p>He was just getting to his feet to go in search of it when one of his brothers ran nimbly up his shoulder and squeaked with anxious alarm into his ear. Kretos listened intently as he told the rat to repeat and then ran swiftly to the opening on the face of the ravine. A black-clad figure was just dropping to his feet as Kretos arrived. Pressing into the shadows, Kretos watched him brush himself down and then followed him cautiously, back through the tunnels.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 26, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');

The climb down was not as easy as Velkaan had made it sound when describing the best hand and footholds. Neither was finding his way through the network of tunnels that riddled the mountain beneath the fortress. Crouching down at yet another intersection, he stared down each of three options open to him and finally admitted that he was lost. He must have taken a wrong turn somewhere but he was reluctant to use even the Mother’s power, so close to Duman, to find out where. He closed his eyes and listened to the sounds that even the sharp ears of the many rats that followed him could not detect. He knew Kretos was still there, he could hear his heartbeat. <p></p>\r\n<p>"Kretos," he called in a hoarse whisper and winced as it echoed noisily along the rock. "I know you''re there. I need to talk to you."</p>\r\n<p>Kretos stepped out of the shadows and stared at Jarok with unfriendly suspicion. No one in their right mind broke into Ak''thai. The last person to come willingly (he did not count Alyse since he knew about the Shadows'' possession) had been the stupid peasant boy with dreams of grandeur, for whom Kretos had paid the price with a life of pain and bitterness. </p>\r\n<p>"Are you Kretos?" asked Jarok, knowing perfectly well that the unkempt, frowning individual was indeed he. "I don''t mean to be rude but time is of the essence. Velkaan said you would help me." </p>\r\n<p>Kreto’s heart thumped strangely at the mention of Velkaan’s name but his tone betrayed none of his eagerness to have news of his friend.</p>\r\n<p>"What if I am? Who are you? And how do you know Velkaan?"</p>\r\n<p>"If you are... then you can guide me through these tunnels. My name is Jarok... not that that would really mean anything to you. And Velkaan gave me your parchment. He trusted me. He said I could trust you. Can I?"</p>\r\n<p>"This way," said Kretos curtly by way of answer and strode off with Jarok hurrying behind.</p>\r\n<p>''Easy when you know how,'' thought Jarok as, a short walk later, they came out of the tunnels into the lower pens. Only two torches lit the entire length of the long corridor that was suspended in an eerie silence of stale air and foul stench. Jarok gazed about curiously in the dim light. Either side of the corridor, door after door stood open, revealing cupboard-sized spaces strewn with rotting straw and stale faeces. It had an aura of morbity so thick, it coated Jarok’s senses like slime. He could almost see it, oozing down the dank walls. At the far end of the corridor a set of winding stairs rose, crossing landing after landing. A quick glance down each revealed the same tale: Every door ajar, every room empty. Dungeons of some sort Jarok guessed and wondered just exactly who Duman been keeping here and where had they gone. By now they had reached the end of the stairs and another door. Kretos stopped and turning caught Jarok’s curious expression.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman’s... masterpieces," his shoulders flicked a dull shrug, though his tone spoke volumes as to the identity of the previous occupants. "I released them: these and many others. Duman has become so preoccupied he cares nothing about the lower regions anymore."</p>\r\n<p>Jarok frowned. He had the distinct feeling that Kretos meant more than ''let them go''. Kretos was quick to pick up his disapproval and gave a mocking snort.</p>\r\n<p>"Don''t judge me until you''ve seen what I''ve seen. I was one of the lucky ones."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry," said Jarok regretting his thoughts immediately. Kretos had only done what he thought was merciful... and no doubt he was right to do so if the flash of horror in his eyes was anything to go by. "For everything."</p>\r\n<p>"It doesn''t help."</p>\r\n<p>The pain in the voice cut Jarok to the quick and suddenly he knew what hate was. It left a bad taste in his mouth that he had trouble swallowing as he ran after Kretos, who was on the move again. </p>\r\n<p>On the third level after the second door, Kretos turned down the corridor. This one too, was empty &mdash; all except one cell. Jarok could hear someone speaking, a voice drifting softly through the open grille in the door. He tilted his head slightly. It was Ansukese and it had a faint familiarity. The door was shut but not locked. Kretos swung it open and waved Jarok inside.</p>\r\n<p>A thin and ragged, bearded man sat on a bed of straw beneath a blanket of living fur. He was talking softly as he stroked the shining bodies and laughing at the playful antics of the smaller members of his company. He looked up as the door creaked open and his face widened in surprise and then delight. Carefully easing the rats aside, he jumped to his feet.</p>\r\n<p>"At last,” he cried. "Someone who can talk back. You don''t know how glad I am to see you. You wouldn''t have brought any wine by any chance? Probably not. What I wouldn''t give for a jug! Have you come from outside? What news? Is it all over? Did we win? You''re not a mute are you? Please don''t be a mute."</p>\r\n<p>"Tynan? Sir Tynan? Is that you?" asked Jarok incredulously, struggling to superimpose the thin, gaunt features over the jovial chubbiness he remembered.</p>\r\n<p>"Do I know you?" Tynan frowned.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s me, Jarok."</p>\r\n<p>Tynan pushed Jarok roughly in the chest and rounded on Kretos.</p>\r\n<p>"So, you are working for Duman after all?" he spat in disgust. "I don''t know what sick kind of game he''s trying to play but tell him to get his facts straight first. Jarok is only eight years old. And as for you... " he lunged at Jarok, who grabbed his arms in a firm grip and forced him back onto the straw. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m sorry," he apologized immediately, kneeling down beside him. "It''s a long story but I am Jarok. Alyse’s brother. All pouch and questions? Powerwielder. Dragonmark... well actually I missed that bit," he admitted wryly. "Cymon. Davin. Eagle’s feather on the bow, you gave me a stone with a leaf pressed into it when we left." </p>\r\n<p>"How d''you know that," Tynan asked in soft amazement.</p>\r\n<p>"Because it''s me! Please Tynan, I''ve already been through all this with Yushok," he pleaded for the knight to remember and pulled off his hood, leaning closer so Tynan could look deep into his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"By the Mother,” he breathed. "It is. What? How? When? What are you doing here?"</p>\r\n<p>"Now I know how everybody else felt," Jarok grinned. "First things first. Apologize to Kretos. He didn''t deserve the things you said. He''s risked a lot helping the outside... and you."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m truly sorry," said Tynan, getting to his feet and offering his hand to Kretos. "Friends?"</p>\r\n<p>Though his hand remained somewhat limp, Kretos accepted the gesture then looked over at Jarok. </p>\r\n<p>"I''ll help you," he said decisively. "This one was fighting against Duman’s creatures. I trust him. My brother knew his name. You know him... he knows you. Now I trust you. I''ll help."</p>\r\n<p>"Thank you," Jarok put a hand on Kreto’s shoulder and gave him a grateful smile.&nbsp;Kretos shrugged and rubbed his neck, clearly uncomfortable with his feelings.</p>\r\n<p>"So, what exactly is it that he''s helping you with?" Tynan asked, though he was certain he was not going to like the answer.</p>\r\n<p>"Duman has Alyse," Jarok replied flatly. "I''ve come to rescue her."</p>\r\n<p>Tynans jaw dropped open and then snapped shut. He dropped onto the straw for a second time where he sat scratching his head, but whether from disbelief or biting fleas it is impolite to ask.</p>\r\n<p>"That is going to take some doing," he scratched his shoulder. "Who else is here?"</p>\r\n<p>"Just me."</p>\r\n<p>"Just...! You''re joking right?" he gave a half-hearted laugh. "Tell me you''re joking. You''re not are you?" he answered himself, closing his eyes and heaving a sigh of despair when Jarok merely stared back in silence. </p>\r\n<p>"I''m quite capable, believe me... if all goes well. All I need is a diversion and a little information. Kretos?"</p>\r\n<p>"Information be damned, what I need is a full-bodied bottle! Mother, why me, why do you always give them to me?" he muttered as Jarok and Kretos sat down beside him. "I''m truly sorry, Davin for all the times I called you mad. This one''s got you beat by a bull’s eye... and then some. I''m listening,” he grunted, as Jarok nudged him in the ribs and told him to pay attention.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as Kretos began it was clear he was well informed. By the time he finished, Jarok and Tynan were amazed by the depths of his knowledge of Duman’s plans. He spoke without arrogance or self-flattery for his achievements, a fact which gained their admiration as much as his daring courage and brilliance of mind. His hatred of Duman however was blatantly clear, as was his disappointment that his expectations had come to nought when he related how he had slipped the diseased component into Duman’s spell. But Tynan was not as convinced of Kreto’s failure. </p>\r\n<p>"Diseases take time to reveal themselves," he argued. "If they work the same way within magic as they do in living things, outward signs are often the very last thing to show. It might even now, be eating away at the spell he had cast on Alyse. Weakening it perhaps," he suggested hopefully. "If only there were some way we could find out?" he murmured.</p>\r\n<p>"There may be but it''s dangerous, too dangerous for something less important. If Duman’s binding is damaged, Cymon should be able to reach Alyse through their bond without Duman knowing. I can''t contact Cymon but I can contact Yushok... I just hope they''re still together," replied Jarok thoughtfully then turned to Kretos. "Can you find out where Duman is right now? I need to know if he''s busy."</p>\r\n<p>Kretos picked up the rat sitting by his side. It ran off and some time later came back to say that Duman had gone to the Casting Room. There was much noise coming from inside.</p>\r\n<p>"Good." Jarok reached out his hands to Tynan and Kretos. "I''ll need your help for this. All of you," he nodded to the gathered rats. "This place belongs to Duman. I need your essence to channel my power."</p>\r\n<p>"Won''t he detect you?" asked Kretos warily.</p>\r\n<p>"Not if his mind is fully occupied, especially as I''m going to use the Mother’s power not the Earth’s. At this level we''re still within natural stone and it should slide through without causing too much disturbance."</p>\r\n<p>Tynan had no idea what he was talking about and Kretos was trembling with fear but they both took his grip. The rats climbed over them, as many as could find a space. Jarok smiled as he felt the Mother’s presence in their nearness. He kept his thoughts tight and leaned out.</p>\r\n<p>''Yushok. Listen... don''t speak and when you do, do so quietly. Tell Cymon to try to contact Alyse... softly. No, don''t tell him about me, unless you have to. I need to know how the spell that binds her is holding. No, I can''t say anymore. Hurry!''&nbsp;He opened his eyes. </p>\r\n<p>"Now what?" asked Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Now we wait. And hope the answer doesn''t take too long," Jarok looked solemnly from one to the other. </p>\r\n<p>For Duman, the answer he sought came quicker than he had imagined. Once he had found the starting point he needed, the desired spell flowed beautifully and all but wrote itself. Better still, it had proven less complicated than he had feared. When his scribblings were completed he had checked them thoroughly, rolled up the scroll and leaned back in his chair, stretching with satisfaction. He moved to the window and gazed out into the distance. What was happening out there? It was some time, he realised, since he ventured to look and even longer since any reports had arrived. He had been far too neglectful of late, he thought to himself. His ever-present suspicions about everyone and everything rose eagerly to the surface, demanding investigation, but he dismissed them and all his cares, with an easy shrug. What did it matter? He had everything he needed now. Soon ultimate power would be truly his and then he could simply sweep away anything that had not gone according to his plans and start anew. He still had plenty of goblin stock below Ak''thai. He might even make a few improvements, he grinned. A tweak here...&nbsp;a twist there... He spun around and strode to the door.</p>\r\n<p>He did not hurry but ambled leisurely, luxuriating in the throb of expectation that buzzed through the Huri stone. He took a roundabout route through the fortress stopping to rap gently on each Orb-room door and to gloat eloquently over the stone figure of Ecos. He rubbed his palms with pleasure along the walls as he walked. Intoxicated by the pulsating energies soaking through his slippers, his feet left the floor and he floated the rest of the way to his Casting Room.</p>\r\n<p>The air stank with the anger seeping down the astro-dimensional cortex and spilling out into the temporal realm. Duman’s mouth twisted in a sneer of malicious delight and he taunted the Black Runes by describing the details of his spell as he prepared the components. He laughed mockingly as dust trickled down the shaking walls, loosened by their impotent attempts to force an opening through the boundaries. Lightening flashed from his fingers and distant screams echoed painfully across the abyss. Duman rolled his neck, eased the tension from his shoulders and locked and cracked his fingers, as he turned his mind to the seriousness of the matter. With a dramatic swirl of his robe, he moved into the centre of the room and raised his arms above his head.</p>\r\n<p>The room shuddered under flaring magic. Summoned runes of sizzling, fathomless blackness discharged their wrath in jagged bolts that seared the air asunder only to die, fizzling pathetically upon the force field Duman had erected about himself. It would take eternity to summon them all, there were simply too many but then he did not need to. A select few of the strongest and those relevant to his problem would suffice. His own rune was capable enough of protecting him from the rest; especially with the input of magic it would gain from their defeat at this casting. </p>\r\n<p>He called them, disabled them, linked and bound them and then dissolved the force field. With a firm swipe of a sharp fingernail, he cut his flesh and plucked a tongue of the Lifefire from within his throat. Lips muttering and fingers flying he reversed its properties, branded his will and commands upon it and sent it into the trapped runes. If at any time in the future they, or any other of the Black Runes, attempted to interfere with his life-force again, this spell would be activated automatically and would drain some of their power and turn it against them and next time, he warned them, it would not cease until it had consumed them completely. </p>\r\n<p>Not all the string of incantations that followed were strictly necessary, but Duman was so enjoying the squirming misery and strangled anger of his captured and powerless victims, that he threw in a few extra just for the fun of prolonging it. When at last he tired of it, he clapped his hands. The runes burned beneath the black fire and when it was done it returned to his extended finger. Placing tongue on tongue, he consumed the flame. The wound in his throat sealed and his casting was done. </p>\r\n<p>In the ensuing stillness, Duman frowned in reflection. It had passed quickly at the time and the moment had not leant itself for pause, but he thought he had sensed a slight shudder run through the stone beneath his feet during the casting &mdash; a momentary tilt of vision, as though a pocket had opened and shut, a hiccup of imbalance. Of course, it could well have been the other runes trying to filter some disturbance through to distract his control but better safe than sorry. He would waste no more time. First he would find out all the girl knew about controlling the Dragon’s power. Theory was all very well but no substitute for experience. She had that... and he would get it out of her. And then... then none of this would matter anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Feet skittered through the tiny gap in the wall followed by alarmed squeaking. Duman was on the move. His brother said Duman was muttering about... ''wasting time''... and... ''getting to it'', which Kretos translated for the others.</p>\r\n<p>"He''s gone to the Summoning Chamber."</p>\r\n<p>"Then so must we," said Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"You won''t get in," Kretos shook his head. "The door is warded. Only Duman can enter, unless he removes the wards."</p>\r\n<p>"Then we have to think of a way to get him to do so."</p>\r\n<p>"Let''s think on the way," suggested Tynan. </p>\r\n<p>"A warning before we leave," Kretos blocked the doorway. "The pens are covered by a containment ward. The noise was too great for Duman’s concentration, he explained. Once we are beyond them, you must speak as little as possible and then only in the softest whispers. The stone knows me and doesn''t react to my voice but yours'' will send tremors he will detect." </p>\r\n<p>"I understand," nodded Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t. You''re not seriously implying the stone is alive in some way?" scoffed Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"Everything has life," returned Jarok, then added with a glint in his eye and a wink to Kretos. "Some is just denser than others."</p>\r\n<p>"Just because I''m... All alone," Tynan finished and rushed after them, catching up about halfway down the passage. Kretos moved swiftly through the corridors and stairs of the upper pens and, holding his finger to his lips in a final warning, out into the maze of Ak''thai itself. </p>\r\n<p>When they entered the fortress proper, Tynan began to understand what Kretos and Jarok had meant. There was no mistaking the lurking evil that pervaded the place &mdash; the unnatural buzzing in the stone beneath his hands and feet setting a cold chill in his stomach that he recognised as fear. For Jarok the effects were far more acute. </p>\r\n<p>The unnatural resonance of the magically crafted Huri stone was antipathetic to all that he was. The sharp, acrid discordance grated in nauseating disharmony with the consistent rhythmic flow of both elements of his being. Nature and Earth, both were repulsed and disgusted by the perverting corruption that emanated from the contamination that was the essence of the stone of darkness. Too late he realised the Mother’s unspoken warning when she had given him the Dragonscale garb. He doubled over, weak with disorientation and pain. Unlike Ecos, Jarok could not retreat behind the mental barriers of Alyse’s mortal frame to shield himself, for he was not mortal, despite appearances. For him, there was nowhere to hide.</p>\r\n<p>He fell to his knees, fighting down the suffocating dizziness that caused his eyes to roll alarmingly and disappear up into his head. His body ached and burned, as though pounded with heavy clubs studded with white-hot needles. He could have countered the effects in an instant using his combined Powers, if he wanted to yell at Duman... ''here I am, come get me!'' But it was not yet time. Instead he groaned as another cramp seized his griping stomach and heaved it up into his chest.</p>\r\n<p>"Tynan!" </p>\r\n<p>His strangled gasp dragged its way to the knight’s ears. Turning, Tynan choked back his own exclamation and rushed to take the outstretched hand in his own. It was ice-cold and he rubbed vigorously, while his skilled eyes ran with concern over the ashen-grey pallor beneath the glistening sheen of clammy sweat that beaded Jarok’s brow.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t stop here," whispered Kretos, leaning over Tynan’s shoulder. He was equally anxious but for different reasons. "I''m not the only one who walks these halls."</p>\r\n<p>"Just a moment,” hissed Tynan, bending closer to Jarok who was again reaching out. The cold fingers touched his cheek, spreading across his right temple and eye as the thumb searched for and found, the hollow behind the base of Tynan’s ear.</p>\r\n<p>''Hath no fear. I mean thee no harm.''</p>\r\n<p>The voice in Tynan’s head sounded like Jarok’s and yet it was not. It was deeper, with more resonance, like that of Ecos &mdash; ancient and yet strung with the light naivety of a child.</p>\r\n<p>''I didst not anticipate the evil wouldst be so potent, or this frame so susceptible. How dost thou remain so strong? What be thine secret? Wouldst thou please help me, friend Tynan?” I don''t understand. Who are you? Help you how?''</p>\r\n<p>BOOM!</p>\r\n<p>A rush of wind whistled passed his ears, blowing all his questions with it as he was swept down the pathways of his memories; to birth and beyond and back again into the spiralling helter-skelter of his emotions.</p>\r\n<p>''Thou art truly amazing! Mine consciousness in this flesh hath not the like.'' the voice whispered in delight.</p>\r\n<p>''I''ve lived longer.'' </p>\r\n<p>BOOM!</p>\r\n<p>Again his ears whistled to the wind and he was off again, treading softly through the delicate gardens of his hopes and dreams that led into the multi-coloured landscape of his imagination.</p>\r\n<p>''This I do know, but so much... I didst not think the finite mind couldst be so... so... limitless.'' </p>\r\n<p>Incredulity tumbled through Tynan’s mind that he found amusing having guessed, at least in some part, the identity of his ''guest''. They stopped abruptly, before a row of heavily barred and bolted doors.</p>\r\n<p>''What art these?'' </p>\r\n<p>''My sanity,'' replied Tynan without hesitation, surprising himself somewhat, for he had never consciously thought of them that way before.</p>\r\n<p>''Then this is what I seek. Show me!'' </p>\r\n<p>Excitement in the urgent tone softened the order into a plea, to which Tynan responded as best as he was able.</p>\r\n<p>''Doth it work?'' asked the voice as Tynan turned the key in the last lock. </p>\r\n<p>''''Not always,'' Tynan admitted, ''but it helps... at least it does for me. But some things you just have to learn to live with. It takes time but you learn.''</p>\r\n<p>''Time, I hath not. But if thou wilt take no offence, I wouldst dare to say that mine locks wilt be more powerful than thine, friend Tynan. Thank you.'' </p>\r\n<p>''I''m not going to remember any of this, am I?'' Tynan asked and stated as the warm flood of gratitude that filled him was blown away by yet another rush of blood, sent pulsing past his ears by his booming heart. His eyes blinked open as Kretos tapped him urgently on the shoulder.</p>\r\n<p>"Hurry, I think something''s coming."</p>\r\n<p>"Then help me get him up," said Tynan. "I''ll have to carry him."</p>\r\n<p>"That won''t be necessary. An arm will do just fine." </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s voice startled them both, for he had appeared completely unconscious only a moment ago. A squeak of alarm sounded at their feet and they both grabbed and arm each and, hauling Jarok to his feet, moved as fast as they could after the scampering rat. Upstairs, down ramps, past twisting corridors and along straight hallways, that ran without bend and yet brought them again to the central walkway with their place of entry to right or left. Nothing was as it seemed: the Laws of Nature transformed into a farcical caricature of normality, with deceptive slopes and impossible angles. It was a frightening vision of the world to come &mdash; a world where chaos was order. But even more frightening, was that the longer they travelled through it, the more it began to make sense. They stopped at yet another corner. Kretos peered cautiously around it and then hurried them back into a small room, thick with dust and cobwebs.</p>\r\n<p>"What is it?" asked Tynan, helping Jarok to the floor.</p>\r\n<p>"Ssh,” hissed Kretos, a finger to his lips and nodded to one of the rats that had accompanied them. A short while later it returned to say that the spider had settled itself into a high niche and showed every sign of staying put. Kretos cursed. Tynan glanced at Jarok bewildered by Kreto’s reaction. It was only a spider, he remarked aloud. </p>\r\n<p>"The word ''only'' doesn''t apply in Ak''thai. I thought you would have realised that by now," snapped Kretos with curt impatience. "The spider is one of Duman’s watchers. It''s twice the size of your fist and has eight eyes set on stalks that enable it to see in all directions at once. Its silk is like wire and contains a corrosive that can burn through anything. It''s not ''only'' a spider and what it sees, it reports to Duman. I''m going to have to try and lure it away. Stay here until I get back."</p>\r\n<p>Gathering an armful of the many items discarded about the room, Kretos left and making enough noise to gain it''s attention, led the spider on a merry chase through the fortress until an easy meal fell into its path and it settled down to eat.</p>\r\n<p>While they waited for Kreto’s return, Jarok lay back gathering his strength and began to sense a soft pressure upon his mind. It was tenuous at best, surrounded as he was by such a strong aura of evil and Jarok struggled to hear the faint murmurings without compromising the rigid bonds of silence he had been forced to erect. Tynan watched the fleeting expressions chasing each other across Jarok’s face with apprehension, fearing a relapse of his earlier collapse, until Jarok at last opened his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"The magic is flawed and weakening," he told Tynan with a broad grin. "Alyse also thinks there''s something else amiss but she hasn''t figured it out yet. She''ll let Cymon know the moment she does... if she is able."</p>\r\n<p>"Does she know abo...&nbsp;Did you feel that?" gasped Tynan, cutting himself off as the floor shuddered beneath them. Jarok nodded, it would have been impossible not to. Four more followed in rapid succession. He pulled on his hood and started towards the door.</p>\r\n<p>"We can''t wait for Kretos any longer. Alyse may not have much more time."</p>\r\n<p>"I''d feel a lot happier if I had a weapon," murmured Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, the door exploded inwards and he was plucked off his feet by an invisible grip crushing his throat.</p>\r\n<p>"A weapon would avail you nothing here!"</p>\r\n<p>In every Race, emotions heavy. Grief. Despair. Desperation. </p>\r\n<p>Weary hearts beat strained with fear within the breast of all creation.</p>\r\n<p>Races joined in battle storm. Thunderous clash of blade and sword.</p>\r\n<p>Bravely fought and cruelly slain defending ''gainst the evil horde.</p>\r\n<p>Sacrificing to protect the mortal right to live.</p>\r\n<p>A game, no more, for Powers that Rule, amusement for to give.</p>\r\n<p>Yet having set events in motion, themselves on knifes'' edge rested blind.</p>\r\n<p>For none could pierce the shrouds of grey where outcome hid behind.</p>\r\n<p>A Hero.

He had come and gone so quickly, before she had a chance to say all things she needed to tell him. Aching, she had remained at the place where their two psyches joined and where the touch of his essence still lingered faintly. She felt different here. Safer. There was lightness, a sweetness unmarred by the oppressive domination of sorcery that weighed upon her elsewhere. On impulse she began to call up the memories she had stored here about Cymon that was natural, about. Mailon, Sh''ailon, her mother, about Yushok, about Royle, about Defiant, about the white mare, about the Oaken Chamber, about the sweeping beauty of Phelise. With sudden insight she quickly stored them away again and returning to her centre, pulled forth the image of the magical seal that had bound her. Five circles. One marked. One marked!<p></p>\r\n<p>She was still laughing delightedly when she was unceremoniously snatched out of herself and transported to another place. She felt confused. This was nothing like the astral planes. There she had withdrawn from the physical realm and existed within her own thoughts but she had always felt the presence of her body without. There was no awareness of body here &mdash; only a fluidity of essence given substance. Panicked, her essence swirled the Orb seeking a way back to her body, finding instead the hideously contorted face of Duman peering closer and closer. Then he was all about her &mdash; touching, stroking, moulding, violating the bright, pastel innocence of her essence with the foul drabness of his own. She shrank away in disgust, recoiling as tightly as she could into the centre of the Orb to evade him. With slow, taunting deliberation, the greyness ebbed and flowed in her wake until she was completely enveloped.</p>\r\n<p>"I do so enjoy the first time... " Duman’s slithering voice crawled all over her. It was neither vocal nor mental... it was simply there, a part of her, disorientating her, sickening her with its septic malignance. "... before the games begin. Though even they have their merits on a tedious day."</p>\r\n<p>"Leave me alone,” she cried, trying vainly to force her way through his black mass.</p>\r\n<p>"Willingly. All you have to do is answer my questions, quickly and truthfully. I want to know everything about how you control the Dragon’s power. And don''t bother pretending ignorance," he warned swiftly to the flashing pulse of denial that darkened the Orb. "Your colour betrays you. The golden flecks that speckle your essence could have come from nowhere else. It has touched you and you it. I want to know how."</p>\r\n<p>"I will tell you nothing," she refused flatly.</p>\r\n<p>Soft grey deepened to midnight shadow and then there was pain &mdash; pain that no words could describe. The pain of malicious, sadistic probing tearing apart the disembodied psyche laid exposed and fragile to evil plundering. Prising, pulling, paring, ravaging, thought after thought. Stripping, layer by layer, with torturous inevitability and an undeniable pulse of enjoyment. Feeble as she knew her efforts were, she determined to deny him. Beginning with her knowledge of healing, she called forth every fact she knew about every plant, herb, flower, root, moss and fungus about their shapes, colours, properties, uses, mixtures, seasons. When she had exhausted every tiny, trivial piece of information, she turned to foods. Recipes, flavours, textures. Gradually passing through her childhood of cuts and bruises, smiles and laughter. One by one Duman shred them away. Slicing her to the bone and stealthily padding the corridors of her life like a stalking cat, to the door of her secret place. The simile made her think of Royle and naturally, of Yushok.</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards she had thought it a dream. Sitting by the window, listening to the simmering ''splodge'' of porridge and watching the dawn break, she had been wishing for a friend for Jarok. Saddened by the thought of him spending another, lonely summer with only the trees and animals to play with. As if in answer, a strange figure had danced out of the forest &mdash; a funny little man with sticky-out ears, a long plait that swung wildly from side to side and twinkling eyes marvellously alive with merriment. Laughing at his tumbling antics she had agreed to his trade of breakfast for the pretty yellow stone in his palm. Jarok had a penchant for pretty things &mdash; treasures for his mysterious pouch. She knew what it was now. The Eye of Ecos. Just like the one secreted in her pocket... </p>\r\n<p>''No! No! Stupid... Stupid!'' she berated herself. ''Do not think of it. Think of another.'' </p>\r\n<p>Too late, Duman had already pounced.</p>\r\n<p>Tossed and buffeted, she was flung back across the distance between the two prisons, shattered and bruised by Duman’s brutal attack. Yet she felt nothing of it &mdash; only rabid self-recrimination from which she was inconsolable. Ecos'' soothing words fell as noticeable as drizzle in a hailstorm. Writhing in an agony of regret over her lapse of concentration, she spiralled down on a slope of avid dejection greased by the weight of the consequences of her failure. But even as she hastened to the yawning abyss that was blessedly devoid of all responsibility, another voice demanded she stay and she clung to Cymon’s tender touch.</p>\r\n<p>At first, Alyse’s attempts to defy him had amused Duman and aroused a grudging respect as an admirable opponent. However, after a while he grew bored by the intricate details of her puny life and increased his demands, viciously whipping away at the fabric of her mind to unveil the secrets she determined to keep hidden.</p>\r\n<p>The inner surface of the Orb shadowed green, as it picked up the warning hum emanating from the sensitive stone of the fortress. Cursing, he eased back from his pressurizing of his captive to listen. Intruders! Here in Ak''thai! </p>\r\n<p>It could not be. Yet impossible as it seemed, it was unlikely to be a mistake. He cursed again. He would have to go and investigate. Then a name caught his attention: Yushok!&nbsp;Intruders forgotten for the time being, he settled back and allowed Alyse to continue her ramblings. Almost white with elation, his essence swirled about the Orb as the discovery unfolded. In a blinding flash he sent her sprawling back to her prison and summoned the power within the amber casing in her pocket. Power within power, without a will to wield it, its transference from Orb to Orb was unresisting. The pure light it exuded radiated throughout the crystal, illuminating the entire room and beyond. Grey mist shrank in awe. Unsullied by the tainting touch of Dark Magic, it was wholesome and unbound, pure supreme perfection. And it was all his. With only the thinnest of tendrils, his smoky-grey essence assumed its tentative violation into the latent power, vividly alert for the slightest sense of danger. When he felt no adverse effects he increased his presence, thickening the tangled threads. Well accustomed to the touch of power (albeit dark and forbidding) Duman’s mind already possessed a vastness of expanse and durability, far exceeding that of any other mere mortal, and ambition and desire provided the impetus needed to stretch those boundaries still further, in order to accommodate the wealth being offered. Nor did he need concern himself with the possibility of madness and panic that its limitlessness provoked in a limited consciousness. His mind was intimately familiar with the realm of insanity and was in no danger of teetering over the edge, that moment had long since passed. Obstacles removed then, he merely opened himself and, like a vacuum, sucked in every last drop until he was filled. Yet even in the wild throes of his ecstatic fusion he was able to retain enough lucidity to experience a passing disappointment that it was not all he had expected. Somehow he had imagined he would feel so much more... learn so much more. </p>\r\n<p>Once the merge was complete, the ringing of the stone impinged again on his consciousness. The Orb cleared and Duman’s body leaped upright, alive and vigorous: with his blood circulating, with his heart racing, with his mind, frighteningly awhirl and more dangerous than ever. He turned his hands over, examining them with delight and lifting them up to touch his beaming face. He wanted to explore and experiment, but other matters called him and his anger rose in double layers of outrage and frustration. He stormed to the door and flung it wide.</p>\r\n<p>"KRETOS!"</p>\r\n<p>Kretos shuddered to a halt and tumbled backwards down the tower steps. Quivering, he lay terrified in the darkness as Duman’s voice boomed a second time. Suddenly, he was gripped in a mighty wind and tossed, spinning through the air to crash painfully at the wizard’s feet. Energy flashed from Duman’s eyes, striking Kretos in the chest. Blood spurted from his mouth and blisters rose on his blackened flesh. A nail beneath his chin pulled him to his feet. Gasping with fear, Kretos peered up through his matted fringe only to shrink back from the sight. Everything vile and loathsome was there, from the sadistic malice in the piercing eyes to the lazy sneer of his mocking contempt and the self-adoring complacency of his arrogance. But now there was even more. Kretos saw it immediately. The restrained megalomania, that had previously ebbed and flowed beneath the surface, was now loosed from his core with a hideous radiance of absolute and maniacal positivity. And something even worse shone in the wizard’s gleaming, gold-speckled eyes. Knowledge. </p>\r\n<p>He knew about the two-legs!</p>\r\n<p>Heedless of the self-inflicted wounds as Duman’s nail scored his chin and face, Kretos threw himself to the floor, kissing Duman’s slippered feet with unashamed terror.</p>\r\n<p>"M... m... master," he stammered through chattering teeth. "I h... have been s... s... searching for you everyw... w... where. Th... there are s... spies M...master. H... h...here."</p>\r\n<p>"You lying scudworm,” bellowed Duman and pain ripped through Kretos again. </p>\r\n<p>Smoke drifted up from singed hair. One eye closed shut in his swollen, purpling face. Thrown over onto his back by the blow, he screamed as fire flashed the length of his outstretched body, streaking across the central opening of the fortress to the opposite landing and sending it crashing to the floor below. Eight, jagged bolts of lightning arced simultaneously from the spread of Duman’s fingers and joined in a multi-coloured explosion high above. Kretos shivered with terrified dread as Duman’s wild, uncontrolled screeches rode on the thunderclaps of energy pouring from his loosened thoughts of destruction and rocked the foundations of the fortress.</p>\r\n<p>"M...m... master?" Kretos squeaked his terror at the wizard’s apparent total loss of reasoning and it’s consequences, numbing his pain and opening his throat. </p>\r\n<p>"I w... wouldn''t l... lie to you, m... master. I have l... lured them into one of the r... rooms. P... p... pretending to be... be...befriend them, I t... told them t...to w... wait there and c... c...came to g... get you.&nbsp;I... I... I...," he faltered as Duman suddenly fell silent and fixed him with a freezing glare.</p>\r\n<p>"Where are they?" </p>\r\n<p>The simplicity and oppressive calmness of the question dripped like acid and Kreto’s already cringing body bowed still further at the blatant promise it carried. He slunk forward, almost on his knees, through the corridors to the room where Jarok and Tynan were hiding. His head shot up as the door exploded inwards.</p>\r\n<p>"Weapons would avail you nothing here."</p>\r\n<p>Low and ominous, Duman’s voice preceded his terrible presence into the room. His hand flashed out and Tynan was lifted, choking, off the floor and flung violently against Jarok. They picked themselves up slowly under the narrowed, piercing gaze that raked them from head to foot. Duman’s nostrils flared with snorted disgust above his twisted mouth. Jarok moved slightly in front of Tynan, as the knight jerked in reaction to the silent insult and placed a hand of restraint on the arm of the older man.</p>\r\n<p>"I don''t know whether to be amused or insulted," observed Duman dryly. "I thought Yushok might have at least sent someone worthy of my interest, if not my time, if he was too cowardly to face me himself. Not a puny pair of obvious imbeciles, who get themselves caught before they''ve even begun."</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok didn''t send us,” cried Tynan angrily before Jarok could stop him, then both heads turned in amazed disbelief as Kreto’s voice whined from the doorway.</p>\r\n<p>"H... he''s l... lying M... master. I h... heard the o... one in b... black say he had s... s... spoken to Y... Yushok. They w... wanted m... me to lead them t... to the S... s... summoning Ch... chamber."</p>\r\n<p>"Why you two-faced, treacherous... "</p>\r\n<p>Tynan’s head was almost knocked off his shoulders by the force of the blow that intercepted his lunge towards Kretos. The world blackened at the edges as he fell to the floor. He felt the prick of Kretos dagger point tapping at his throat. He struggled dazedly to throw him off; unaware it was only Kretos that stood between him and the death in Duman’s second thrust.</p>\r\n<p>"He will m... make good eating for those b...below M... master. But they l... like their m... meat l... living. M... may I h... have him M... master?" </p>\r\n<p>Duman squeezed a dark look through his eyelids and flicked his wrist.</p>\r\n<p>"One end is as good as another. Just see that it is an end. As for you," he beckoned slowly to Jarok, "why don''t you join me in my chamber and show me just what you find so interesting there."</p>\r\n<p>As soon as Jarok and Duman were out of sight, Kretos loosened his grip on Tynan, who threw him aside and jumped to his feet, stretching his hands threateningly. Instantly he was faced by a large number of rats barring his path.</p>\r\n<p>"What''s wrong with you?" asked Kretos, regretting his earlier ease with the two-legs.</p>\r\n<p>"Come closer and I''ll show you," spat Tynan.</p>\r\n<p>"The other one was right. Some life is denser than others. You think I betrayed you?"</p>\r\n<p>"I think leading Duman straight to us could be called betrayal," observed Tynan sarcastically.</p>\r\n<p>"I did what I had to do. The other one understood."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m not so easily understanding," replied Tynan. "Just do what you''re going to do and be done with it. But I warn you, I''ll not go without a fight."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh please. You two-legs are so pathetic! How can I feed you to something that isn''t there?" he asked impatiently.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan stared at him blankly for a moment before he remembered the empty pens. A slow but livid flush of embarrassment crawled up his neck as he realised that, not only had Kretos been trying to tell him they were still on the same side, he had also saved his life. He cursed himself silently as all kinds of an idiot, sighed deeply and ate an extra large slice of humble pie, apologising profusely to an outwardly indifferent Kretos.</p>\r\n<p>"He already knew about you," Kretos told him. "I had no choice but to bring him here or we would all be dead. At least this way we''ve achieved our objective. He''ll have to remove the wards to allow the other one to enter. Are you coming or not?"</p>\r\n<p>Tynan followed Kretos through the murky passages, pausing every now and again to allow the waves of dizziness to pass through his thumping head. Eventually, Kretos stopped at a corner and indicated the chamber was in the next corridor. They edged cautiously towards it and could scarcely believe their luck when they found the door still ajar. Kretos slipped across the opening first, holding up his palm and shaking his head so that Tynan was forced to wait.</p>\r\n<p>Inside the room, Kretos could see Duman pacing around Jarok, who was standing about five paces from the table. He knew the wizard well and recognised the dominant strut, meant to intimidate the victim. Next would come the threats and promises and then the pain. There was always pain. But Jarok was not reacting as he should. There was no sign of fear. No shaking or trembling. No nervous shifting of the eyes. No cringing, or pleading for mercy. He merely stood, staring at the wall opposite, his expression guarded and unreadable. Duman was growing ever more angry. Kretos could tell by the twitch at the corner of his mouth and the tap of his fingers against his robe. He stopped behind Jarok, whispering something low into his ear that Kretos could not hear, and then he hooked a nail into Jarok’s hood and wrenched it from his head.</p>\r\n<p>"Perhaps now you can hear me better," he said louder, dangling the torn hood in front of Jarok’s face before letting it fall.</p>\r\n<p>"I heard you perfectly before," Jarok answered at last, tilting his head and raising a disdainful eyebrow. "I simply declined to answer the obvious."</p>\r\n<p>"You dare to provoke me?" Duman’s spluttered exclamation sprayed the air. "I could snap you in two in an instant and still keep you alive to feel my wrath."</p>\r\n<p>"But you won''t," Jarok shot him a knowing smile. "You want an audience for your triumph."</p>\r\n<p>"You''re extraordinarily well-informed," remarked Duman and laughed. "But you''re right. You shall be the first recipient of my new and improved abilities and as such, it''s only fair that you bear witness to my acquisition of Ecos'' power. I do in fact already possess half of it, courtesy of the silly child whom, I assume, you''ve come to rescue." His voice dropped to a purring whisper. "Did you know, that torture of the psyche is infinitely more pleasurable than that of the body... and without the mess?"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok bit his lip and said nothing, though his mind screamed. Duman was at the table now, lowering himself into the chair and reaching out his hands to the Orb. Jarok looked over his shoulder to the door where he sensed Kretos and Tynan crouched, waiting for his word. He frowned and flicked his eyelids, warning them to remain still. Duman’s head snapped up immediately.</p>\r\n<p>"Run, if you so desire. You won''t get out of Ak''thai and it will be all the worse for you if I have to come and find you again."</p>\r\n<p>"It never entered my head," replied Jarok entirely truthfully. "I was just thinking how disappointing this all is. Yushok described you as far more frightening. I guess that''s what happens when you get to your age. You tend to lose your edge."</p>\r\n<p>"Yushok,” spat Duman, taking the bait just as Jarok had hoped he would. "The creature has been the bane of my life. I''ll have his ears for a necklace and his eyes for toggles on my favourite slippers. I already have the power of the second Eye and soon all the Dragon’s power shall be mine." His voice rose and with it the Power within him rumbled to life, straining at its leash. Duman threw back his head, his hair lifting from his scalp in a crackling frizz. His eyes rolled madly and fiery breath erupted from his mouth along with his ranting words of egotistical domination that revealed the great divide that existed between his dreams and success, as he gloated of possessing what could not be owned. Insane laughter rose hysterically above each burst of flashing energy that escaped the rupturing pathways of his psyche.</p>\r\n<p>"I shall subjugate my gaolers. Crush all beneath my might and majesty and storm forth from the boundaries of my prison. Then all will bow before me and I shall sweep them away with a flick of my finger. And when Her creation lies in tatters at Her feet, I shall stride into the Mother’s domain and She shall beg for my mercy as I send Her into oblivion. And I, Duman; Elfin perfection and Mage Supreme; shall be Master of Creation!" </p>\r\n<p>His body expanded almost to the height of the chamber with the rising chords of his oration. Shining daggers of light protruded through his flesh, from his mouth and eyes. The rampant Power was threatening to tear him apart.</p>\r\n<p>Outside, Tynan waited anxiously for Jarok’s signal. Kretos smiled with satisfaction, convinced the end was near. But Jarok only stood motionless. Waiting. The Black Runes had invested too much in Duman over the centuries, to let him go so easily. Even though he had revealed his intent for their subjugation and possible destruction, he had also revealed a weakness through which he retained his value to them and a need, which they might continue to exploit and use to control him. So, of their own accord they released their magic, sealing the ravaged veils of his psychic domain and erected a temporary buffer between his sanity, expunction and the violent destruction of the priceless Power. </p>\r\n<p>As control was restored and the effects died down, Duman was filled with dismay at the extremity of the danger and horror (though he hid it well) at how close he had come to death. Still, now he was aware of it, he could take steps to safeguard himself before absorbing any further Power. His will re-mastered and returned to his normal stature, he opened his eyes and was startled to find Jarok full of amusement. The boy should have been a quivering jelly after witnessing such an awesome display of his might, not laughing up at him with dancing eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"Haven''t quite got the hang of it yet, have you?" Jarok dared to taunt.</p>\r\n<p>"Who are you?" demanded Duman, releasing a spell that should have had Jarok gasping for breath.</p>\r\n<p>"Tut, tut,” clucked Jarok, wagging a scolding finger in Duman’s face. "You really should control that temper. My name''s Jarok." </p>\r\n<p>"The girls'' brother?" Duman frowned in bewilderment, growing increasingly uneasy. His skin was tingling, a low flame beginning to burn in his belly that made sense before his mind did, of the complete absence of fear in the black clad youth and the failure of his spell.</p>\r\n<p>"We had the same birth-mother, yes, but different parents. Her father was a Man, named Keitel. Can you guess who mine was? Come now, where''s that quick and superior mind that you''re so fond of bragging about?" </p>\r\n<p>That quick and superior mind was frozen in confused frustration, trying to grope something out of nothing. </p>\r\n<p>''But he''s dead... he''s dead,'' was all that kept repeating in his mind. </p>\r\n<p>Then his eyes flicked wide as the Power in him flared, responding to some outside influence. A tiny seed of doubt and disbelief began to wriggle free from the mire of his ignorance and sprouted leaves of denial. Leaves that multiplied into a dense bush as Jarok, warming now to his task, heaved a sigh of impatience and resumed speaking.</p>\r\n<p>"You know, for all your cleverness you really are extremely slow. Even after all these centuries of scheming and researching, you still haven''t learnt a thing. Alyse did not possess the Power any more than it possessed her. She merely became a vessel. Offering her own body and mind as a settling place. They are now One Being, since only one essence can naturally exist in one body. She is controller, only because it is herself that she controls, just as the will controls the mind. The Power is not a ''thing'' to own, Kåiel. It is a living entity. As you almost found to your cost and will again, should your control waver just one iota too far. You still look bemused. Still haven''t figured it out? Still don''t understand? We don''t keep the Power. We don''t horde it. Possess it. Control or master it, as you seek to do. Elfin orphan... </p>\r\n<p>We are the Power!"</p>\r\n<p>Jarok paused, a mocking eyebrow rising in answer to the befuddled stare that drew a dark ridge across the brow of the wizard’s shaking head.</p>\r\n<p>"It was all there to be understood. Even in your own tongue to make it easy for you.</p>\r\n<p>Soleb. Tareb. Baroth. Felnath. Ecos... Sol taar bb Rth. F èll n''ath os. Power... born to physical form... onto the Earth in equal division.</p>\r\n<p>Comprehension dawns in your eyes at last! Shall I go on? As to me, my father is Ecos, but you may be forgiven for not realising my identity. Even my uncles didn''t know and the human pronunciation is deceiving. In any case, even amongst the Elfin it is an ancient name and unused since the beginning of time. Only one other had borne it. The firstborn son of Y''siel."</p>\r\n<p>Runes appeared about Duman’s head (one of them his own, Dhukma) as his mind flailed beneath the slowly crumbling ruins of his hopes and dreams, feeding his shrinking arrogance and self-confidence. Reinstating his greed and lust with the promise of limitless assistance and an open book of knowledge with which to conquer, not only that which stood before him but also the Power bound in the Orbs. The silent voices of the Black Ones took form and reached down through the corridors of the Halls of Power, whispering Position and Awe. </p>\r\n<p>The youth was lying, they said. Trying to turn Duman’s head. Undermine his confidence. Put him off-guard in order to rescue the girl. Look at the clothing he wore. It was made from Dragonscale. It was this and not the youths'' parentage that enabled him to withstand Duman’s sorcery. It was an act. A bluff. He must call it. Absorb the Power now!</p>\r\n<p>Duman put his hands over his ears, struggling to retain the tiny glimmer of sanity that called from deep within and which they sought to dispel.</p>\r\n<p>"They''re calling to you, aren''t they? Don''t listen," Jarok spoke gently, moving towards the table. "They''re deceiving you. They always have been. They don''t care what it will do to you... what it''s already doing to you. They only want to keep us from the Mother."</p>\r\n<p>As soon as it was out of his mouth, Jarok knew it had been the wrong thing to say. Duman’s unreasonable and passionate abhorrence for the Mother was rooted deep in the core of his essence and the mention of Her name tipped the balance in favour of the Darkness. Duman’s face was illuminated from within as he drew on both forces that raged within him. Throwing his arms wide he summoned more of the Black runes to his aid, until the walls and ceiling were full and the air was thick and throbbing with their obsidian presence. Then he was at the table, his hands curling about the clear, cold surface of the Orb. </p>\r\n<p>Something flashed from the doorway and Duman was knocked sideways as Tynan crashed into him. From up above, energy surged and Tynan cried out and fell to the floor, flames licking up his legs as he rolled into a corner. Regaining his balance, Duman reached again for the Orb. This time it was Jarok that stood in his way. Duman’s arm swung outwards, striking lightning into Jarok’s chest before he could stop himself. The spell bounced off the Dragonscales and hit Dhukma.</p>\r\n<p>"No,” screamed Duman, but it was already too late. </p>\r\n<p>Dhukma retaliated. Again lightning crackled towards Jarok. Again it ricocheted &mdash; this time, onto the marked surface of the table. Magic exploded in five-pointed star-fire as the protective casing of the pentagram was released by the familiar touch of Duman’s rune. This was what Jarok had been waiting for and getting to the table before Duman, made a grab for the Orb. But though the barriers of the pentagram were gone, the carved tripod still protected it from any hand but Duman’s own and the magic of its wards ate into Jarok’s exposed palm like acid. He pulled his hand free to Duman’s mocking laugh of triumph.</p>\r\n<p>"You may be his son... but you''re still only one. I, on the other hand, have five at my fingertips,” he cried. And the five Orbs of Containment appeared, as circling moons, about the Melding Orb. "Plus all the force of the Black Arts. You can''t stop me. You can''t even stop your own pain," he sniggered, as Jarok winced from the sizzling burns in his flesh, conveniently ignoring the fact that the touch should have disintegrated Jarok completely. His voice rang out in forceful commands and the runes above resonated in accordance. Energies discharged and absorbed from one to the other were transferred to Duman’s masterful fingers as he mouthed the incantations that would restore the protective field around himself and the Orbs.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok sensed the tension rising in the wizard. Could feel the deepening pressure in the room. He had to stop him. If Duman succeeded, he would never get another chance. Desperately he wracked his brain for a solution. He could not attack Duman for the runes kept invading his path. Their magic might not work on him but he could not pass through their presence. He could not throw anything since the room was empty but for the chair (which was behind Duman and out of reach) and the table... The table! He might not be able to touch the Orb but he might be able to touch the table. </p>\r\n<p>Easier said than done. The runes kept barring his way. No matter how hard he tried, he could not slip passed. Duman watched his efforts dispassionately, concentrating only on his casting. With loud triumph, he uttered the final words and drew back his arms.</p>\r\n<p>"Now,” shouted Jarok.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan had been watching Jarok and, guessing correctly, had pulled himself across the floor. On Jarok’s cry, Tynan shook the leg nearest to him. The table rocked and the Orb set up a humming pulse as it ran precariously around the edge of the tripod. Overbalancing as he tried to steady the table with his thigh, Duman reached automatically to steady himself and inadvertently released the impatient magic sparking on his fingertips. It streaked upwards and struck Aexiir, a rune of destruction. Aexiir was one of the oldest and most powerful of all the runes and not to be trifled with. The contradictory magic of protection provoked instant reaction. A mighty thunderclap rocked the room as its retaliatory strike surged down upon the source of the attack. Duman’s reaction was again automatic and unavoidable, in order to defend himself. He struck the advancing blow aside. </p>\r\n<p>Jarok’s reaction however, was completely calculated. He threw himself into the path of Duman’s defence and sent the crackling force spinning off Dragonscale into the table. The nearside of the table exploded in a shower of splintered wood. What was left toppled over, taking the tripod with it. Time slowed down as the Orb bounced through the acrid smoke, avoiding both sets of questing hands and rolled across the stone to come to rest at the feet of Kretos, standing just inside the doorway. Two voices cried in negative unison as he bent down and picked it up.</p>\r\n<p>Instantly the throb of Power thrilled his blood. It was impossible to ignore its vibrant caress pulsing through his melting flesh and tingling his mind and spirit. </p>\r\n<p>The room, the people in it, his family, and the whole world ceased to be. Only the Orb and its promises existed &mdash; power unimaginable, all his for the taking, for the wanting. He could do anything, be anything... be everything. With this he could return to his rightful form. The answer was here in Ak''thai somewhere, amongst Duman’s scrolls and books. This could find it for him. With this, he could use that information and become what he once was. What he was born to be.</p>\r\n<p>He could lead his family out of the dark places, up from the bowels of the Earth, out of the sewers and gutters of the two-legs'' existence. He could raise them up from the ranks of vermin; take them from... from where, from their place in life, from the station that the Mother herself had created them to fill? </p>\r\n<p>So they may become what? So they may become two-legs on four feet, Goblins to his ''Duman''? To what end, and at whose expense? At the expense of the rest of the Mother’s children.</p>\r\n<p>But why should he care about them? What did they care for him and the others of his family? Generation after generation of vilification and slaughter gave him the answer. Nothing! They cared nothing! But with this, he could rid his race of their hatred. With one gesture, one thought, he could be rid of them all. He could even be rid of Duman! Would he not then become as they? Selfish. Greedy. Intolerant. Without compassion or conscience. And what of the few? </p>\r\n<p>Velkaan, Jarok, Tynan, those that had called him ''friend'', they were not as the others. Were there more such as those? </p>\r\n<p>Did he care? He wanted his life back &mdash; as it was, without violation, without mutilation, without the loathsome mutation he had been forced to endure for years past his allotted time. He wanted children and generations of children after them, bearing his name, his blood.</p>\r\n<p>He could have all these things... and much, much more... should he accept this wondrous gift delivered into his hands and offering itself into his being. Kretos gazed transfixed, into the Orb. His expression blank and unreadable, save for the answering light shining in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p>This then... was the moment of choice. The fragment of eternal Time in which everything... every living being that existed or would exist... held its breath &mdash; the eternal Time when the Halls of Power rang silent. When the Pool of Life stilled. A second. A day. An eternity. </p>\r\n<p>Stretched and squashed in this one, suspended fragment of free will.</p>\r\n<p>Deeper and deeper, Kretos fell into the shimmering invitation of the Orb, losing himself in the intoxicating promise that danced and beckoned for his decision. His head came up slowly. Eyes, cold as the crystal resting on his palm, gazed long and lingering at Jarok and then at Duman. Satisfaction and joy curved the corners of his mouth. His eyes sparkled with triumphant delight as he closed his hands tighter about the glistening Orb.</p>\r\n<p>Eternity gasped. And then the Orb was arcing through the air. Lightning flashed and Kretos crumpled in a heap, his life’s'' blood seeping into a pool beneath his head as Jarok lifted his hand to accept his Destiny. From the depths of the Earth rose a tumultuous roar that split Ak''thai in two and sped through the Halls of Power in a whirlwind of exhilaration, as the two Powers which Jarok bore (and which through necessity he had been forced to keep separate) were at last united. </p>\r\n<p>A blinding flash of light tore the darkness asunder and settled about him. Thick and impenetrable, it defied the eye and denied the senses. A great wind howled and Earth tilted. The sun and moon paled and then flared in recognition. The stars pushed through the veil of day to pay sparkling homage, while the night danced in fluttering ribbons across the pastel shades of this days'' crowded skies. </p>\r\n<p>Creation bowed its head in welcome.</p>\r\n<p>"My father thou knowest," said a deep, resonant voice from within the light. "Mine mother I wilt now tell thee. It is She who is the Mother of all... even thee. Though the mistake doth grieve Her heart sore. Behold, I am Jár''ròche... Power Reborn! </p>\r\n<p>Of Father and Mother both. Less than each but greater as One!"</p>\r\n<p>White as winter was the body of the Dragon revealed by the lights'' passing. The shade of fresh, spring shoots, the green ridge along his back graduated in deepening hue to a triangular tail of autumn russet. The Dragon reared majestically, regal head raised proudly on outstretched neck and wings unfurled to reveal an underside of warm azure. Fixed in the grip of his left front talons was the Orb, which he held aloft with a loud, trumpeting cry before dropping back to the ground to swing his powerful head towards Duman and fix him with eyes gleaming with all the colours of creation. The Black runes of Ak''thai trembled before his presence, whilst the Containment Orbs flared in joyous recognition and moved to circle about his head. Swirling eyes blinked slowly as each one passed then snapped back to the desperately muttering wizard.</p>\r\n<p>"Listen to me spawn of Evil. For mine Mother’s sake wilt I offer thee thy life. Repent of all that thou hast done and what thou hast become and I wilt spare thee."</p>\r\n<p>Duman spat on the floor at the Dragon’s feet.</p>\r\n<p>"That for your mercy. You can''t kill me or your precious... whatever they are... will be stuck forever. My death won''t secure their release, if that''s what you''re hoping," he jeered, his lips twisting and his fists uncurled swiftly, to throw his spell into the Dragon’s maw. Jár''ròche reached up and caught the bolt. Sizzling energy hissed and died in the shower of water gushing from the Dragon’s mouth, who then crumbled the blackened remains and scattered them at Duman’s feet. Thick, coiling stems sprang to life around Duman’s legs and body as the pieces touched the ground. A disdainful finger disintegrated them into a pile of ash.</p>\r\n<p>"Great and feared wizard," boomed the Dragon, with not a trace of admiration. "Thine skill is about as awesome as thine intelligence. I needeth thee not to free my brethren. Thou hast already done it for me. Thee... and the courage of one of the lowliest of mine Mother’s children. For he whom thou despised was possessed of a greater courage and cunning than thou wouldst ever have. He didst plant in thine sorcery a diseased component, which weakens thine grip with every passing moment. As for thy part, the Powerwielder is not merely of the race of Man. Her mother wast Elfin. And that part of her rests unbound within my grasp and through it, all the power of the Mother. Ah, yes,” the Dragon’s lips curled back over gleaming rows of fearsome teeth in a knowing grin. "Thou didst seek to bind them but in truth, ''twas only thyself that thou didst bind. Thy lustful avarice didst and hath, through all time, blinded thee. Again the obvious was given thee for thy taking but thy pretension guided thee instead on the path of the complicated, where thou didst waste thine opportunities seeking the unnecessary.</p>\r\n<p>Soleb; Light. Tareb; Water. Felnath; Wind. Baroth; Fire. Ecos; Earth.</p>\r\n<p>What art these... but the forces of Mother Nature herself...?"</p>\r\n<p>The question was left hanging in the air, as Duman finally understood the reality. It had been there in his grasp since the moment he had entrapped the Dragons. They were the Mother’s Power &mdash; her arm in the world above. Without them she had been, to all intents and purposes, defenceless &mdash; his for the taking. He could have confronted Her at any time. He had not needed the Dragonspower. His own would have been enough, especially when She was already weak from the days of growth and harvest. </p>\r\n<p>Dumans eyes darkened. Pools of jet and crimson insanity whirled with the seeping blood of broken vessels. He cared nothing for it. He no longer needed eyes to see the sight of the Power now let loose in him by his violent, insuperable rage was more than ample. His arms came up. The runes about him converged, forming the symbol of Darkness with his own, Dhukma, at its centre. More and more appeared to his silent summoning and his confidence revelled and soared at the ease and speed with which they were forced to obey him. Channelled through Dhukma, he absorbed them all. Glorying in the seething madness of his chaotic psyche, for it drowned the anguish of his shattered aspirations &mdash; the exposure of his delusions, the vast and miserable lie that had been his life. He pressed his fists to his temples and screamed. Evil reeked from his mouth, colouring his breath black, and oozed from every pore of his body. Black light surged from his eyes, black fire from his tongue, sizzling energy from his fingertips. His being swelled, growing until he stood eye to eye with the Dragon who, mercifully for creation, had become the personification of all he abhorred. Gazes locked and held suspended, while Death crossed the threshold and took her place in the room. Her cowled head nodded and the Confrontation began. </p>\r\n<p>There was no need for incantations or wild gestures. Thought alone now directed the moulded sorcery that split the air and fused the destructive energies of the Black runes to Duman’s bidding. In the centre of the room, magic and Power parried blows. Behind thick columns of smoke, fire raged and lightning flashed, tearing the stronghold of Runic Ak''thai apart, layer-by-layer. The stone beneath the terrified figure of Tynan, crumbled. A great spire of rock thrust upwards from the mountain below to cradle him gently and lower him carefully to solid earth below. A portal gaped open behind the Dragon, creating a hungry wind that tried to suck him into the dimensional void beyond. Jár''ròche rose effortlessly. He blinked once. Millions upon millions of insects crawled out from every crack and crevice and flew in through window and door and swarmed over the wizard. Soon he was invisible beneath the biting and stinging, heaving blackness, his concentration broken and no longer able to sustain the portals'' stability. It slammed shut. His failure reverberated through his psyche in such waves of agonizing pain that, for a few moments, the magic hurtled haphazardly in all directions, vaporizing anything in its path until the last bastions of Ak''thai crumbled to dirt and ashes.</p>\r\n<p>Loosed of all confines, magic-tainted Power streaked far across the landscape and up into the roiling cloud above. Sorcery seeped through the sodden ground and rose in seething mists, enveloping the Dragon in a sulphurous stench. Jár''ròche breathed upon the yellow cloud and it drifted higher, whitening and cooling, and fluttered delicately over Duman’s shoulders in sparkling flakes of snow. The Dragon’s tail whipped upwards and slammed fiercely into the ground, rending a great chasm between the two adversaries. Molten lava bubbled from the earths'' core and spilled over to flow, white hot, towards the wizard’s feet. Duman’s eyes rose to the sky and the hovering grey cloud spewed water to cool the lava into sizzling, black rock.</p>\r\n<p>Trees grew; their roots twisting and turning above ground in a confining maze... and withered at Duman’s touch. </p>\r\n<p>Vines rose, engulfing the wizard in a net of green... and were seared to ash by his burning eyes. </p>\r\n<p>The Earth heaved and thrust &mdash; quaked and tremored.&nbsp;Magic swelled and Darkness exploded. Lightning bolts of runic energy scorched ground and air. </p>\r\n<p>Green mists and black sparks surrounded and stabbed, sizzled and seared, upon the white scales of the Dragon.</p>\r\n<p>Unbridled sorcery cleaved through the fabric of reality. Magic and Power circulating in torrid eddies, whipping Dragon and Wizard with equal ferocity. </p>\r\n<p>Monsters and demons crossed the unstable dimensions and the children of the Mother &mdash; from bear to bird, insect to lion, from Unicorn to Mahadran; stepped from the breath of the Dragon to fight and conquer or die. </p>\r\n<p>Not a single grain of sand passed through the glass of Time while the two opponents remained locked in their conflagration. Worried looks strained the faces of the Powers that Ruled, as no end appeared in sight. The two forces seeming evenly matched. However, there was one thing they were not aware of. That Jarok had drained the majority of Power from the second Eye before sending it to Alyse, leaving only enough to lead Duman into a false sense of ability. But there was also a more basic difference that separated them beyond the measure of Power. </p>\r\n<p>A force that exists through destruction can only end up destroying itself. And though the Black Arts were able to bend and break the laws of nature, they were nevertheless bound by the laws of their own magic and by the same token (since it was ruled by the nature of the wielder) so too, was the Power Duman had stolen. So, with every defeat their strength was weakened.&nbsp;Power, magic and life force drained, until only Dhukma was left. And though he knew the demise of the rune would surely mean his own end too, still Duman’s hate and rage fuelled his futile compulsion to persist. Thus it was inevitable that Dhukma too, flickered and died. Duman collapsed, shivering and spent, slavering tongue raging vile obscenities even as he sobbed in dire anguish with pleading arms outstretched. Inside his tattered psyche, what was left of the Power hammered at the last remaining tangles of his control. His tortured and ravaged mind, broken and demented. Power... the only victor.</p>\r\n<p>"Its not fair. Why should you have it all?" he screamed in one breath, while the next blubbered piteously, "Please, help me."</p>\r\n<p>Jár''ròche stood over him. Draconian eyes unfathomable. He felt no joy. No elation or satisfaction as he gazed down upon the wrecked shell of the once, proud Elven Elite. For moment anger stirred against those that had seduced and driven him to this sorrowful end but it was fleeting. The elf had made his own choices&mdash; walked his own path. </p>\r\n<p>"Thou hast already refused mine offer. Thy fate is not now mine to bestow but that of those whom thou didst sorely wrong," said Jár''ròche dispassionately and left his quivering frame to answer Tynan’s call. The knight gazed up at him through the moist sadness of his eyes. In his lap he cradled the gasping body of Kretos, who was amazingly, still clinging tenuously onto life. His lids fluttered open.</p>\r\n<p>"Is it over?" Blood dribbled over the feebly gasped words. Peace floated across his face as the Dragon nodded. "Then I can go."</p>\r\n<p>"Yes, mine child. Thou mayest rest now. We shalt meet anon in the Mother’s embrace.</p>\r\n<p>What thou hast done shalt not be forgotten," a single talon pressed lightly upon Kreto’s brow and his lids slid down on a final sigh. ''Mother, guard his spirit and grant it respite in the Pool of Life until mine return, for he hath earned his reward,'' the Dragon whispered </p>\r\n<p>quietly with bowed head. His eyes opened and with a nod to Tynan, moved to a clear space and triumphantly, held the Orb aloft. </p>\r\n<p>"Allienne,” Jár''ròches'' command echoed through the debris of Ak''thai, stirring the witless Duman to a moments'' lucid passion, which he used to curse the Dragon’s and all creation, before it swiftly passed away. "Summon mine uncles unto thee: Power to Power, Light to Light."</p>\r\n<p>The Melding Orb flared, disappearing in the brilliant radiance of combined Powers. Grasping each of the other Orbs in turn, Jár''ròche crushed them to dust with one powerful squeeze. His eyes whirled. Chiselled facets melting into swirling pools reflected in the crystal surface of the Orb. The essences'' of those within blazed with a piercing intensity and merged with that of the glowing Dragon, concealing all whilst dispersing the remnants of the dark cloud above to reveal the hidden depths of the Windstone Ravine and spreading to illuminate the land far and wide. Just when Tynan thought it might never stop, it began to recede. Taking on colour with mystic substance. Light but not light. Mist but not mist. A swirling, whirling, joyful sphere of pulsating, entwining, dancing bands of throbbing shades and hues in which all the seasons came and went in simultaneous harmony. Tynan would willingly have watched it forever but slowly, shade by shade, colour by colour, the bands began to separate, five smaller clouds of light orbiting a central one, tightening and thickening into form as they rotated, coalescing into flesh and scale, talons and curved horns.&nbsp;Jár''ròche was the first to reappear. Then... red, blue, purple and green... the four brothers heralded their return to the world. Only the sphere that was Alyse failed to respond and continued in its swirling path. Jár''ròche called to the brothers and they settled in a circle around the sphere, great minds reaching out but they could not enter. Tynan did not know much about Dragons but he could sense their concern and confusion. They obviously had no idea why Alyse had not materialized and no idea what to do about it. He rose and stepped to the circle and was granted silent acceptance into their presence.</p>\r\n<p>"Come on, Alyse. Come on," he whispered under his breath until he could stand it no more. </p>\r\n<p>"Alyse, stop messing about and get out here right now,” he shouted angrily.</p>\r\n<p>Five massive heads swung down and stared at him, eyes swirling with surprise at his impudence. The flaming scarlet of his face vied with that of Soleb for brilliance. Then he noticed colours beginning to appear within the sphere.</p>\r\n<p>"Look,” he cried, with a beaming grin that grew wider when they gave a united gasp of mystified wonder as the sphere split into two. </p>\r\n<p>Alyse materialized first, a bare nod of her head acknowledging their presence as she waited with eyes fixed upon the remaining spinning mist. The colours solidified and a Dragon’s shape began to take form: wings of bronze on a body of purest gold, ridges of burnt copper and a tail-tip of polished silver, talons of ivory hue and two horns curving proudly on his massive head &mdash; one the deep, rich black of fertile soil and the other veined with all the colours of the gems of the Earth. Beneath their feet, the same Earth tilted in ecstatic welcome as the Dragon rose majestically and a powerful voice cried out in exultation.</p>\r\n<p>"Old and New. Behold! I am Ecos!"</p>\r\n<p>"Father?"</p>\r\n<p>"Forgive our delay," Ecos apologised, dropping back down, "but I couldst not bear the thought of assuming the same form that his hand hath touched. Yet I knew nothing else. Such is our excuse. Alyse didst choose for me. I am well pleased." He lowered his head, his enormous muzzle appearing incongruous in Alyse’s tiny hand.</p>\r\n<p>"But how canst be possible?"</p>\r\n<p>Tynan grinned to hear the deep bewilderment within the question of such a great and powerful being and then groaned in empathy as Ecos'' explanation left him none the wiser.</p>\r\n<p>"Twas something we didst discover by chance and perfected during our imprisonment. We art still One but only a small part of each doth remain in each form. Thus we wert able to separate as personalities though we art still a single entity of existence. Thou didst indeed choose wisely my brothers."</p>\r\n<p>Jár''ròche gazed closely from one to the other. He could see it now. Specks of cornflower dotted the centre of each facet of Ecos'' eyes, while those of Alyse glittered with minute, golden flecks. They also glittered with anxious impatience and reminded him (as they so often had Jarok in their past lives) of his duty and purpose. </p>\r\n<p>Together, the group strode to where a gibbering Duman lay muttering insanely amid the rubble of his destruction. From her pocket Alyse pulled out the dark, cold casing that had once safeguarded the great Power now standing beside her.</p>\r\n<p>"Might I suggest?" she asked with an uncharacteristic lack of compassion. "A fitting punishment."</p>\r\n<p>Using their combined wills the Dragons were able to invoke that which had been part of themselves and which Duman had stolen and (carefully avoiding contact with its tainted essence) transfer it, along with the entangled mush that was the remains of Duman’s psyche, into the cold amber. Tarnished gold mingled with variegated grey and pulsed weakly against the dull stone. </p>\r\n<p>"Tis not enough,” cried Felnath bitterly, snatching the amber from Alyse’s hand. A screeching wind rose out of the ravine, a howling vortex that whipped furiously across the ruins, was lifting dirt and stone and was spinning it in wild torment. Like a towering drill, the whirlwind bored through the scattered stone of Ak''thai forming a dark cloud atop the rising funnel. Charged by the whipping energies, it rumbled ominously and flashed down in a jagged green bolt, striking not the earth but the air and ripping an opening into the dark abyss of Oblivion, through which Felnath hurled the stone with all his might. He roared his wrath behind it, the last note disappearing into black silence just as the rent pulled itself back together. The wind fell silent and the dust settled. Though his brothers looked at him sadly, none could find the heart to fault him. </p>\r\n<p>"Well, that''s that then," quipped Tynan, hoping to break the awkward silence that had suddenly befallen them.</p>\r\n<p>"Not quite," said Alyse, once again reminding the Dragons of their duty and purpose. "The Ancient Heroes await you on the battlefields. I shall accompany Ecos. We must hurry."</p>\r\n<p>"Ahem?" coughed Tynan, a finger raised for attention as the Dragons hunched and spread their wings.</p>\r\n<p>"It wilt be mine honour to carry thee, Sir Tynan." Jár''ròche offered his front leg to help Tynan climb aboard.</p>\r\n<p>Sweeping wings carried the Dragon’s aloft, thrusting them through the air while powerful minds sped faster still before them. East and west, the four Ancient Heroes ceased their battling and raised their eyes to the sky. Friend and foe alike paused in bewilderment before the glow of sublime bliss that radiated, like sparkling sunlight on still waters, in their faces. Then the heroes were running. Eyes and feet seeking higher ground in pursuit of minds that already floated far above the tallest mountain through the bonding link between mortal and Dragon. The sky grew dark as the combined shadows of six Dragons blotted out both sun and moon. Friend and foe cowered together as the Dragons swooped gracefully to the Earth and then rose again, each carrying a Rider upon their backs. </p>\r\n<p>Power and passion, force and direction, immortality impotent without mortal boundaries, mortal frame feeble without immortal might, and yet two minds were linked to one purpose... awesome and undefeated.</p>\r\n<p>And so, in a replay of history, the Dragons poured out their might upon the enemy of the Races that continued their relentless pressing of the thinning lines of the exhausted defenders of the ravaged Earth. </p>\r\n<p>Power channelled by mortal emotion, Soleb drew himself upright in the sky, his wings fanning rhythmically backwards and forwards. Opening his great jaws, he screamed to the heavens. It might have been the imagination of terrified minds, it might not, but down below the mortal fighters saw scarlet talons grasp sun and moon and dip them earthward. Silver and gold flashed in blinding intensity upon Soleb’s gleaming chest and reflected into the smoky haze of battle, lighting the scene with crystal clarity. His ruby tail swung left and right, directing the dazzling brightness away from the defenders and into the faces of Duman’s minions. Panicked and semi-blinded, their advance lost cohesion as each individual sought shelter and shadow. </p>\r\n<p>But there was to be no hiding place. No escape. </p>\r\n<p>Flames of orange and purple blazed forth from the nostrils of the circling Baroth &mdash; a fiery whip to tame the savage beast, cracking white-hot into their midst. Seeking them out from cave and crevice. Scales cracked and peeled. Flesh burnt and blistered. Minds boiled under the searing heat of sun and fire as those that could, turned and ran southward and were trapped between Dragon and quicksand. </p>\r\n<p>At Talgheer, Felnath and Tareb had lined up, wingtip to wingtip, across the heavens. Hailstones as big as a fist, pounded the backs of gracht and goblin. Screaming gales lashed their fronts. Ferocious crosswinds tore and sucked their weapons from their hands, lifted them off their feet and slammed them back onto the unyielding earth. Tareb veered and dipped the edge of one wing into the Westbrooke. Felnath streaked behind him, breathing violent impetus into the torrential flood now racing from the source on Tareb’s tail and lifting it in a surging, white-foamed wall of water that separated children from horde and drove the latter backwards into a writhing mass of pain and terror. The howling fury of Felnath’s pent-up bitterness circled, drawing the towering wave into a raging whirlpool of deafening force that surrounded the remnant of Duman’s army, squeezing until they could retreat no further.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst the Brothers kept the enemy contained, Jár''ròche plucked Ishtak and Ishkat from their midst. One in each of his powerful talons, he carried them to the ruins of Ak''thai. There he showed them Duman’s broken and lifeless body. Told them of Duman’s warped and twisted lies. Explained how Duman had merely been using them for his own gain. Of Duman’s evil ways and of his ultimate defeat. And when he had finished, just as he had with Duman himself, Jár''ròche offered the two goblin generals their lives if they would turn aside from their hatred, call off Duman’s army and help the remainder of their people to learn the errors of their ways and live in peace. But the two goblins heard only that their beloved, Great Father had been cruelly slain and turned violently upon the Dragon. </p>\r\n<p>"So be it," his voice whispered with sadness and, scooping them up one in each grip, he crushed their life slowly from their bodies. Yet those same, merciless talons laid them down with infinite gentleness on either side of the wizard to whom they had remained steadfastly and selflessly loyal. One powerful thrust and he was riding the wind. His sorrowful cry filling earth and sky. </p>\r\n<p>Ecos, who had been hovering high above, responded instantly. His sinuous neck extended and his massive wings folded back along his shimmering body, he spiralled downwards. At the last moment he lifted his head and whistled across the rushing ground before striking the earth with his tail and soaring skyward once more. The Earth trembled. Rippling waves rolling beneath its surface, broke about the two isolated groups of goblin and gracht and the shattered ruins of Ak''thai. Rumbling groans opened narrow fissures at their feet and throughout the fallen stone. Booming roars from far below forced them wider. From its molten core, the Earth spewed fierce-hot lava into the chasm, melting the lower stratum of rock. With inexorable slowness, Duman’s shattered dreams disappeared below the surface, leaving behind only the echoing shrieks and screams of misled minions as they too, finally succumbed to the deadly embrace of the</p>\r\n<p>living Earth. </p>\r\n<p>Once more the war has ended.</p>\r\n<p>Within the molten breast of Mother Earth,</p>\r\n<p>the telling of my tale finds rest,</p>\r\n<p>But rest alone. Not end.</p>\r\n<p>For what is an ending but a new beginning?</p>\r\n<p>Verily, Duman is dead. His dreams shattered.</p>\r\n<p>Aspirations and desires in tattered shreds on ivory talons,</p>\r\n<p>strewn within the rubble of the once infamous and feared Runic Ak''thai.</p>\r\n<p>Bastion of Darkness. Pierced by Light.</p>\r\n<p>Itself now cradled in Her fiery embrace.</p>\r\n<p>This then, the consequence of his greed and lust. </p>\r\n<p>A mind buckled and broken. </p>\r\n<p>Locked forever in amber prison </p>\r\n<p>with the evil spawn of his destruction his only company.</p>\r\n<p>Power. Not Power pure. But Power tainted.</p>\r\n<p>Without control or direction. Loosed and wild and dark.</p>\r\n<p>Devouring. Destroying. Consuming insanity.</p>\r\n<p>Banished with him into the nether regions of eternal non-existence,</p>\r\n<p>yet denied the peace of it.</p>\r\n<p>Cast adrift in the endless void of Oblivion for all eternity.</p>\r\n<p>So ''tis the end! </p>\r\n<p>I hear the cry ring out.</p>\r\n<p>Alas, dear reader. </p>\r\n<p>I fear you have learnt nothing from your reading.</p>\r\n<p>The game of life within these words having passed you by.</p>\r\n<p>For in the game, is not the pawn the sacrifice of strategy? </p>\r\n<p>And powerful as he might have been, Duman was yet a pawn.</p>\r\n<p>And the evil that died with him, no more than a wisp.</p>\r\n<p>A spindling thread in a bale of cloth.</p>\r\n<p>A single tear in the vastness of the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Like the Mages'' own set free,</p>\r\n<p>a ghostly shadow of the terrifying expanse of the reality.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, be warned and beware. </p>\r\n<p>Be not deceived. Nor complacent in tiny triumphs.</p>\r\n<p>Evil cannot be vanquished.</p>\r\n<p>For Good and Evil... these are the ''Powers that Rule''.</p>\r\n<p>These... and those that serve them.</p>\r\n<p>And between the two stand those that hold no allegiance.</p>\r\n<p>Neither Black nor White. Indifferent to either cause.</p>\r\n<p>Arbitrators only... of the Laws of Power.</p>\r\n<p>Defenders of choice. Keepers of mortality.</p>\r\n<p>Three are they... </p>\r\n<p>Nameless. Faceless. Robes of Grey Neutrality.</p>\r\n<p>Three do serve... </p>\r\n<p>Time. Fate. Hope.</p>\r\n<p>These then, are the ''Powers that Rule''.</p>\r\n<p>Powers, whose game made the telling of this tale.</p>\r\n<p>Yet cruel and selfish as their meddling be in the paths they set out before us... </p>\r\n<p>Which path we chose... by the Law of Grey... by Free Will... </p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, it is our Own.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore I implore... Choose wisely reader... </p>\r\n<p>for so too, are the consequences!</p>\r\n<p>Now fare thee well. My tale is done. Warnings said... and with hope, read.</p>\r\n<p>Let the reader slam shut the cover of this tome.</p>\r\n<p>Yet would such be fair?</p>\r\n<p>To leave the worn and bloodied warriors standing aimlessly in the aftermath of war?</p>\r\n<p>To scribe... ''The End''... and thus be done? No? </p>\r\n<p>Walk, hushed then, in my footsteps.</p>\r\n<p>Speak not, for the corridors of Time do echo noisily in the Halls of Power.</p>\r\n<p>Silent now, let us peek quickly and for one last time, at the tapestry of Fate.</p>\r\n<p>The task they had begun centuries ago finally completed, the five Draconian; Ecos, Tareb, Soleb, Baroth and Felnath were eager to return from whence they came. For one last time their majesty graced the skies of the Earth. From the western cliffs of Qipcha to the red-sand beaches of Sellim, where Fellamund sloped gently into the calm, green waters of the Pahaqua Sea, over the glittering blue glacier of Jhai Nahv in northern S''yumêrra and across the waters of the Bay of Respite in southern Rohansuk. Their awesome beauty delighted the eyes of the Mother’s children for a single day before Jár''ròche sent them joyfully home.</p>\r\n<p>In return for her willingness to join with Ecos and for her courage in attempting and achieving the separation, which returned him to the world, Jár''ròche granted Alyse the lifespan of her Elfin blood. She returned to Phelise with Cymon, Yushok and the pitiful small number that was all that was left of the Elven Elite. </p>\r\n<p>They remained there until the following spring, when they received word that the curse on the Mornay had lifted. Immediately they, and a group of willing volunteers, set out for Rohansuk where they spent the remainder of their long and happy lives restoring Iåñya M''ath to its former glory and raising their five children with the help of Yushok and Naemon &mdash; children who eventually restored the line of Y''siel. The A''mathan.</p>\r\n<p>When the surviving leaders of the Races gathered for the last time, Davin was finally introduced to Velkaan, whose subsequent reunion with Saroya was one of shock, amazement and tearful joy. Their time together however, was necessarily short. True to her word, Eona had spoken volubly on behalf of the surviving goblins, using Sula as living proof, and it was agreed to try to reform their ways. The land of Hur, now released from the contamination of sorcery, was ceded to the gipsies by the Mother herself, at Jár''ròches'' request. </p>\r\n<p>The tribes renamed it ''rròch Sai'', in his honour and from here, Sula, Velkaan and Eona, along with Eiva and a surprisingly large number of others, began the long and difficult task they had set themselves. A task that brought its own reward as the children of that race slowly warmed and blossomed in the light. </p>\r\n<p>Education in Goblin culture and language soon revealed the confusion surrounding the ''friendship'' between Sula and Velkaan &mdash; much to their consternation and everyone else’s'' amusement. But, after the initial shock and embarrassment, it was happily resolved to everyone’s delight and satisfaction and a few years later, the birth of the first of their many children was a time of pride and joy shared by all.</p>\r\n<p>Davin never did regain the full use of his arm and retired from the Knighthood. After a crowded wedding, presided over by a very smug Winaka, the Soyex Xaushoi, he and Saroya settled down in the cottage in the forest that Alyse and Jarok gave to them as a wedding present. Over the years the cottage was extended by dwarven craftsmen, free of charge, to accommodate their four sons and three daughters.</p>\r\n<p>Tynan became a figure of wonder and fame after his ride on Jár''ròche &mdash; a ride that sustained him many a jug in a packed tavern on a chilly night. Promoted to Regent of the newly established ''Order of the Dragon'', he remained in service for ten years before retiring. The only pain in his life was the loss of his betrothed, Ryselle, whom he had met on his way back to Symtar following the end of the war.&nbsp;It had been love at first sight but after a whirlwind week he had told her he could no longer delay his return but promised to come back for her as soon as he had made his report to his superiors. However, events in Symtar took longer than he had anticipated, due to the pomp and ceremony of his promotion and other awards of valour and bravery, bestowed upon the many that </p>\r\n<p>had distinguished themselves during the war. When at last he returned to Ryselle it was only to learn of her death. </p>\r\n<p>After almost two years of living in the bottom of bottles of Fellisan wine, he surfaced into the arms of a compassionate and understanding widow and retired to her vineyard in Rubins'' Corner, in southern Ansuk. Though she was not the love of his life, they were happy and had one daughter together. The widows'' only contention being the inordinately large number of rats and mice that Tynan insisted on allowing roaming unmolested on the property.</p>\r\n<p>Rhodka, Mawbek and Annuk, the only surviving Katas, took their kinsmen home to Katatuk. But it was not to be the same as before. Together they implemented many changes. </p>\r\n<p>The first, by a surprisingly unanimous decision, was to appoint Surke as the first female member of the Conclave. An appointment that often drove Rhodka to distraction. Incredibly, Annuk became her closest friend, after Mawbek, and taught her everything he knew. On opposing sides their heated and skilled debates became legendary... as allies, they were awesome. </p>\r\n<p>Her first proposal as Kata was the re-locating of the libraries to a more central position in all Dwarven communities. To everyone’s’ surprise her proposal was approved and implemented over the following two years.</p>\r\n<p>Another change that followed almost immediately after the war was the opening of the Dwarven borders. A result of which found a surprising number of dwarves choosing to travel and work on the mainland.</p>\r\n<p>Mawbek could not be persuaded to join Surke on her on her occasional diplomatic ventures to the homelands of the other Races. He preferred to spend his ageing years scribing all that had happened during the Duman War, asking Surke to bring back all accounts that she could of the experiences of others, noble and common. When his account was finally finished, Mawbek retired from public life to enjoy his fire, his honeyed tea and the company of old friends.</p>\r\n<p>The Soyex returned to S''yumêrra and their raiding. Little changed with respect to them, except that they now allowed their victims to lower their skiffs before tossing them off their captured ships into the sea. </p>\r\n<p>It was at least, a step in the right direction!</p>\r\n<p>As for the Fellis, there was but a handful left to go home. Even the king had mysteriously disappeared before he could be recalled from Puramena. He had apparently taken it into his head to indulge in midnight swimming and on the last occasion of his doing so, had failed to return. It was concluded he had swum too far, been overtaken by fierce cramps and subsequently drowned. </p>\r\n<p>Without an heir, the throne passed on to the Queen, who subsequently re-married &mdash; her new husband and Prince Regent being the same General that had negotiated the terms for the assistance of the Dwarves and Elfin. </p>\r\n<p>Torje was devastated by the near annihilation of his people but he was even more heartbroken when he discovered what manner of people they had become over the centuries. So, when Jár''ròche asked him what he would like to do, he vowed to return to Fellamund. Seeing their own descendants quite capable of rebuilding their own lives, his friends decided to join him. </p>\r\n<p>Together the Ancient Heroes travelled to Marjasi, where they took Queen and Consort in hand and proceeded to instruct them and the people in their lost heritage and restored the glory and honour of the name of Fellis. Two generations they raised, teaching, building and nurturing &mdash; they were rewarded by seeing the Fellis rise once again, into a nation to be proud of.</p>\r\n<p>By this time Gregos was feeling the presage of time. His sight was failing. His back was bowed and his white hair thinning. They all knew he did not have long left, so rather than be separated, the four beseeched the Mother to take them all together and thus they were reunited, in youth and strength, with the Dragons, where they live to this day.</p>\r\n<p>In the blossoming land of rròch Sai, a mother rat nosed the cold, lifeless body of the youngest of her newborn. She called sadly to one of her older daughters to take it away. A towering figure appeared before her and the rat spread herself protectively over the rest of her litter.</p>\r\n<p>"Fear not, little mother," said a powerful voice, as glistening talons picked up the tiny, pink body with infinite tenderness and dropped a single pearl of sparkling blue water into its mouth. The tiny body shuddered and when the Dragon placed it back in the nest, wriggled eagerly beneath its mother.</p>\r\n<p>"Guard him well and love him dearly, little mother. For he is Kretos &mdash; the best and the bravest of thine race and beloved of this One who calls him friend, Jár''ròche."</p>\r\n<p>Winter passed into glorious summer and eased again into winter sleep. Although the Dragon’s return meant She no longer needed the seasons to regain Her strength, the Mother decided to keep the time of winter sleep for her own indulgence. During this season she spent long days with the Brothers, the Heroes and with Jár''ròche and took to walking again upon the Earth in the form of her children.</p>\r\n<p>So next time you creep through the forest and spy a large, female wolf with ice-blue eyes and a silver streak of winter-white running along her back and think to yourself that her pelt would look good upon your own... think twice before you loose your arrow... </p>\r\n<p>Mother Nature has a habit of biting back!</p>\r\n<p>As for Jár''ròche...</p>\r\n<p>Well, he watched Ecos grow stronger each day. Vitality and lustre shone in the deep metallic colouring of his fathers'' scales and showed in the vibrant growth and rapid healing of the Earth above. Realising that the old Dragon was once more the Power he had once been and that he no longer needed his sons’ assistance, Jár''ròche knew it was time to step back.</p>\r\n<p>Earth was his Fathers'' child... not his.</p>\r\n<p>Jarok rose from the seat beside the Pool of Life. He slipped his pouch over his left shoulder, his quiver over his right and picked up his bow. </p>\r\n<p>“Mother?” he smiled as he kissed her cheek, “It''s time for me to go.”</p>\r\n</div>', 1, 26, 11, 1, 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:38', 1, '2012-03-16 12:47:45');
